{"1469527094000": "\u201cAre we,\u201d Naoki remarks faintly, lying where she was left, spread eagle across the bed. She hadn\u2019t been prepared for the level of stamina Kate apparently possesses.  She spends a moment to process her thoughts before replying, \u201cWell, that\u2019s just the thing, isn\u2019t it. There aren\u2019t exactly many inns, out here in the expanse. No Hotel Auberge, no Moonlight Eclipse, none of that. However, considering that, our options are actually fairly numerous.\u201dNoticing Kate\u2019s search for something to wipe herself with, Naoki raises a hand, weakly gesturing toward a small set of drawers near the door. There ought to be linens inside one of those drawers. Which one, exactly, she doesn\u2019t seem to share- if she even knows.\u201cUp toward the north of the Expanse, in the Saskatoon Mountain range, there\u2019s a place called Silver Mountain, and it\u2019s among one of our better options. As I\u2019ve been told, it was once home to a group of elves who fancied themselves the protectors of the Expanse. It\u2019s a place of magic, spiritual healing, being in touch with one\u2019s self and with nature and all of that. Today, the apparently-entrepreneuring elves seem to have opened the place to the public. Made a sort of resort out of it. I\u2019m told that it\u2019s quite pleasant, and it ought to have some sleeping arrangements.\u201d\u201cWe could also simply turn up to essentially any of the villages spotted across The Expanse and introduce ourselves. I suspect that through some combination of status, bribery, and charm, we could secure lodgings with whoever we might please to. My contact- she\u2019s a nice young lady named Jun. She\u2019s a member of the Celadine tribe, and could vouch for us if we visited her village. There\u2019s a map, up with Stan somewhere in the front, that has all of the villages marked on it, if you\u2019d like.\u201d\u201cOr, alternatively, we could simply park the carriage. I\u2019ve brought several changes of bedlinens, a few tents, and some other assorted bits we could use to sleep outside, if we might be so inclined. The sky probably looks beautiful out here at night\u2026\u201dShe trails off for a moment, evidently contemplating the option of sleeping under the stars, before bringing herself to an upright position with a small groan, evidently somewhat sore.\u201cThe truth of the matter, though, is such that I haven\u2019t made any arrangements, or planned the trip in any real capacity. All I\u2019ve done is clear my schedule for the indefinite future, and fill the carriage full of things I think we might appreciate having. The choice of where to sleep tonight, and essentially all of the choices related to this trip\u2019s path proceeding forward, are yours to make.\u201dWith this said, Naoki throws her legs over the side of the bed, and stands hesitantly. She\u2019s pleasantly surprised to find her legs still able to bear her weight. With a few careful steps, she makes her way over to where Kate is standing, and places a hand on her shoulder- for both support and as a gesture.\u201cAt the risk of coming off as terribly sappy but intending to be honest, I don\u2019t have much of a preference where I sleep tonight, as long as it\u2019s with you.\u201dWith that said, Naoki leans in, doing her best not to fall flat on her face, with every intention of pulling Kate into a relatively simple, yet passionate kiss. ", "1469703008000": "As  Kate\u2019s hand slides down and begins its groping, Naoki inhales sharply through her nose, and her eyes go wide, evidently somewhat surprised. If her tongue had been in her own mouth, she may have yelped. However, after a moment, she composes herself- about as much as anyone can as their \u2018regions\u2019 are being explored- and leans further in to complete the kiss with roughly double the amount of gusto she began it with. Pulling back, furrowing her eyebrows and pouting ever-so-slightly, she fixes Kate with an almost-irritated look. It seems to say, \u2018You lewd woman, you.\u2019Wrapping her tail around behind Kate\u2019s midsection and using it to pull her into another- somewhat shorter, follow-up kiss, Naoki\u2019s lips seems to say, \u2018Never change.\u2019As trivially easy as it would be to reach out to Stan telepathically, and issue her instructions in that manner, Naoki decides to indulge her companion (it is her birthday, after all), raising her voice to call out, \u201cStaaaaan...! To the Celahhhhnnnaaadine Hiiillss,\u201d not making any effort to school her features under Kate\u2019s molestations as she does so. Not having yet been released, Naoki makes no effort to resist Kate\u2019s roaming hands, but a shiver traces its way down her back unbidden, followed by another, more comprehensive tremble.\u201cI\u2019m cold,\u201d Naoki whispers. A quick inspection of her chest, along with the goosebumps forming on her arms would affirm this statement. \u201cCan we sit?\u201d", "1470235304000": "Having managed to successfully disentangle herself long enough to dress, Naoki finds herself seated on the long bench running the length of the right side of the carriage. Not having spent much serious thought on the matter, and simply having selected the first few garments that seemed pretty, she finds herself wearing a loose white blouse with a pleated gray skirt. Idly, she reflects that a disturbingly large percentage of her wardrobe has been taken over by white blouses and lower garments of dark colors, such as gray, black, and brown, even though she has made no conscious decision to make any such change. What happened to all of her brightly colored attire? It\u2019s been absolute ages since she\u2019s seen something green.Additionally, she supposes that if nights out in The Expanse get chilly, so to will she. Perhaps a shawl would be in order. However, she makes no move to obtain one, simply continuing to sit on the bench. A casual glance up to one of the opposite windows sees a dark silhouette pass by with the movement of the carriage, obscuring the rapidly purpling night sky as it passes through the frame of the window\u2019s view. One of those towers they\u2019ve got, she supposes. It would seem that her group has a short ways to go yet before encountering the Celandine clan.  ", "1470308741000": "Seated as she is on the bench, Madame Naoki\u2019s ears perk up as her earring begins to glimmer with considerable intensity. A quick flurry of communications between Naoki, Stan, Jax, the escorting Sun Marshals, and some of the intelligence people back in Isra make Naoki aware of the fact that they are rapidly approaching the Celandine Village, and that Jun herself has been spotted, apparently waving. Rising from her seat, Naoki begins to construct and execute a mental checklist. Foremost among the items on the list, she informs her companions. Raising her voice slightly to address both Kate and Artemis (the latter of whom would seem to be utilising the restroom), Naoki calls, \u201cWe\u2019re very nearly there, we can see them. We\u2019ll be stopping shortly.\u201dNext, Naoki begins to check herself. This would be- whether she\u2019d like it to or not, an at least semi-official meeting between herself and the Celandine people. As such, she ought to at least make the pretense of looking presentable and prepared. She smooths the front of her blouse, checking for stains and finding none. One hand reaches down to her side- her pouch is there. She runs her hands through her hair, checking for knots and making sure it all settles in a reasonable way down her back. Pulling her tail part-way around to the front of her body, Naoki spends a few moments utilising a small cloth to groom it. Finally, just for good measure, she selects a powerfully scented after-meal mint from the kitchenette and pops it into her mouth. After all, it wouldn\u2019t do for her breath to smell like woman.As she turns the mint over on her tongue, Naoki reaches out, using neither her hand nor her tail, but rather her mind, to contact Jun, earring glimmering as she reaches across the space between them to speak directly via telepathy, \u201cHey. It\u2019s me. Or rather, us. My dear companion, when presented with the option, chose to make our first stop your Celandine Village. In hindsight, I probably should have checked with you at that point, rather than waiting until right about now, but is that alright? I mean to say, you said it was fine before,\" referencing their earlier conversation on the matter, \u201cBut I realize it\u2019s a bit late. Should we park here and walk in, or what? How would this best be done?\u201dAs she concludes her communication and begins awaiting Jun\u2019s response, Naoki reseats herself on the bench, seemingly prepared to stand up and walk out at a moment\u2019s notice. Turning slightly to the right, she looks toward Kate, intending to assess her state of readiness. Or ogle her backside, should the opportunity present itself. Whichever, really. ", "1470558068000": "From her seat on the bench, a small, contented sort of smile makes its way onto Naoki\u2019s face as she watches Kate move about the cabin. Her gaze follows Kate as she moves to the window, and slides downward for optimal appreciation of the presented assets. She reflects for a moment on how unquantifiably fortunate she is to have things turn out in just this manner, but shelves the thought to respond to Kate. \u201cThat would be her- Jun, in the flesh. Let\u2019s walk over to meet her.\u201dVery much on cue, the carriage slows to a halt. After a momentary pause, the rear door is opened from the outside, and Jax deploys the stair-ladder, standing off to one side once it is in place. Rising from her seat, Naoki proceeds out the door with no further ado, leaping as she tends to do directly from the carriage to the ground. Stepping off to one side, she waits for Kate to disembark, and after she does, offers her hand- presumably for holding. One might find it to be warm, and gently gripping. Assuming that Kate at least follows her down from the carriage and seems content to walk with her over to the village, Naoki leads the way, offering Jun a wave and a smile as they approach. However, Jun seems to be speaking with someone else. Someone strange. If Kate is still holding her hand, Naoki's grip tightens slightly: a silent indicator of her unease. Behind Naoki, a group of four dismounted Sun Marshals stand quietly. Not necessarily for protection, per-say- Naoki has no intention of disrespecting the security of Raynor's village. However, the Marshals are people too, and components of her party still. Their horses sent ahead to the stable, there isn't much else for them to do besides accompany Naoki to the village, and that seems to be their plan. Still, however, they are on duty, and this funny-looking chap is rather funny-looking, they think. For the time being, however, all they do is stand there silently, taking no significant action. The other six Marshals, along with the carriage, have since disappeared from view.  Regardless, Naoki thinks it best to wait to be greeted, as not to be presumptuous or interrupt Jun's conversation. Instead, she takes this moment to glance over toward the nearest of the stone towers, casually examining the structure of it and doing her very best to avoid seeming as if she's eavesdropping on the conversation proceeding before her. ", "1470898688000": "Naoki is momentarily surprised as Jun blinks forward, flattening her ears against the top of her head, but doesn\u2019t flinch or take evasive action. (It\u2019s easier for the Marshals to do their job if she remains still.) Jun\u2019s intentions turn out to be benign anyway. In response, Naoki wraps her free arm around Jun to reciprocate the hug, leaving her other hand where it is. Idly, she notes that between the height difference between them and the heightening effect of her espadrilles, Jun\u2019s sort of getting a face-full. Not that Naoki minds. She only smirks. At Jun\u2019s inquiry, Naoki nods once, but waits for Raynor to approach before saying anything. Before she does, she offers a half-bow of her own in response, and puts on the voice she uses to speak to people of importance, or individuals she\u2019s meeting for the first time. The respectful and measured voice.\u201cLikewise. I\u2019ve heard of you both from Jun and from some of my other sources, and everything I\u2019ve heard has been positive. It\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Elder Raynor.\u201dAs she\u2019s speaking, she offers her free hand for shaking. Immediately following the shake,  she begins gesturing to each of the present figures in turn, beginning introductions. \u201cKate, this is Jun, and Elder Raynor.\u201d Seeing as how Kate is already well aware of who they both are and the introductions are mostly just for formality\u2019s sake at this point, Naoki doesn\u2019t bother to offer any details. \u201cJun, Elder Raynor, this is Miss Kate Green, my\u2026\u201d A moment\u2019s worth of hesitation.. \u201cSignificant other,\u201d she finishes with a small smile, evidently rather pleased with the fact. Over the course of the conversation, Naoki\u2019s grip on Kate\u2019s hand has dropped its initial firmness. Whether this is due to the smile she received, the Sun Marshals catching up to the pair of them, or simply because the dark haired figure doesn\u2019t seem as much of a threat anymore is up to one\u2019s interpretation, but as it stands, the grip- at least on Naoki\u2019s end- could be easily broken. \u201cAnd these,\u201d Naoki continues, almost as an afterthought, gesturing behind her, \u201cAre a few of my Sun Marshals- some of the most competent individuals under my command. There are eight more in the vicinity, some of whom will stay with the carriage.\u201d \u201cRegardless, I apologize for dropping in so unexpectedly, Elder Raynor. In hindsight, I should have called ahead to ask and notify. My mind was elsewhere when the decision was made.\u201d With the last sentence, Naoki's eyes flick off to one side, toward Kate in a silent sort of signal hopefully both of the Celandines would be able to pick up on and understand.", "1471026898000": "As Kate makes her \u201cimpression\u201d, Naoki\u2019s face shifts from amusement to bemusement and finally to outright concern as Kate disappears off to apparently spend some quality time with that horse- one of the patrolling Marshals. It\u2019s difficult to judge which elements are in play, but two facts seem obvious: Kate just royally embarrassed herself, and something isn\u2019t quite alright with her to have caused such behavior. Perhaps it\u2019s exhaustion? Caught in the metaphorical lights of Jun\u2019s \u2018stardom\u2019? Spending a half moment in recollection, Naoki supposes that this is the first time that Kate has been introduced to anyone in particular in a formal manner. Some manner of obscure phobia or social anxiety? Or perhaps it\u2019s physical. Perhaps she\u2019s ill. Goodness. That wouldn\u2019t be ideal.Regardless, before Naoki can investigate and begin to solve the issue, it would probably be polite to address Jun and Raynor, so she does: \u201cI think she may be feeling a bit ill. We were riding in the carriage all day, and that may not have agreed with her\u2026  delicate stomach.\u201dTo punctuate this statement, Naoki places one of her palms on her chest before bringing it up under her chin and outward to pantomime the act of vomiting, and in doing so implies that Kate probably went off by herself as not to puke in front of everyone. Which Naoki thinks to be about as reasonable excuse as any other.\u201cDinner in an hour sounds excellent. The carriage is loaded up with valuables and state secrets, and our horses have been walking all day and need to be cared for. The Marshals will rotate in the night and catch some left-overs.\u201dThe stranger over in the field is given a quick glance, but is otherwise disregarded by Naoki. There are more important people on her mind. To that end, she continues to address Jun and Raynor, \u201cI\u2019ll catch up in a few minutes. I\u2019m going to go see if she\u2019s alright.\u201dWith that stated, and the pair of them already departing in the other direction, Naoki turns to follow Kate off in the direction of that horse. She walks quickly, still concerned, but walks. As she does, she responds to the mental message, \u201cI played it off as carriage-sickness. You could make some retching noises over there to really ham it up if you\u2019d like. I\u2019m coming over to make sure you\u2019re alright.\u201d Naoki has the intention to approach Kate within a few meters, but leave her to otherwise take action from there.The other Sun Marshals, left alone and unsure of quite what to do with themselves, decide as a unit to follow Jun and Raynor, and offer their assistance to the Celandines with feast-preparation-type-things. ", "1471246515000": "Rounding the corner, Naoki is visibly relieved to find Kate seemingly highly embarrassed, but otherwise none the worse for wear. She considers elaborating on how she doesn\u2019t mind at all, and seriously doubts that Jun or Elder Havalor will hold that first encounter against her, but decides instead to simply nod in what she intends to be interpreted as an understanding way. Naoki continues to nod quietly as Kate continues. She would need to get used to meeting and dealing with \u2018famous\u2019 people- and quickly, too. After pondering the matter for a moment, Naoki offers the following advice, \u201cA big part of it is confidence in yourself. Don\u2019t allow others to dwarf your own sense of self-worth. Keep your shoulders back, head high, make eye contact, and remember that I\u2019ll be right here for you.\u201dWith that, she takes both of Kate\u2019s hands in her own and squeezes slightly while making eye contact, intending to express the support she offers through the gesture, and ease some of Kate's embarrassment at the same time. As Kate takes her by the elbow and begins leading the way back to camp, a small sort of self-satisfied smile curves its way across Naoki\u2019s face. I\u2019m getting better at this \u2018relationship\u2019 thing, she thinks.Regardless, the pair would soon find themselves back at The Celandine village, in the vicinity of whatever manner of feast preparations are presumably underway. Naoki, rather than leading the way, stands slightly behind Kate, suggesting that she lead the way. While it would probably be polite to assist with the feast-making in some manner, cooking\u2026 isn\u2019t exactly Naoki\u2019s forte, and her foremost priority is to offer support to Kate. A second instance of Kate \u2018shitting\u2019 the elder of the village probably wouldn\u2019t be so great for international relations, and to best prevent such things, Naoki figures she ought to keep close.That\u2019s how she justifies it internally, at least. ", "1471475715000": "Naoki treads along quietly, behind and slightly to Kate\u2019s left. A small pang of intense anguish grips Naoki for a moment as she realizes that she\u2019s mimicking Artemis- what with her hands behind her back and the slight, neutral sort of smile. She would need to address that with Kate sometime very soon. But now is neither the time nor place. For now, Naoki offers only her presence, and that little smile- should anyone care to look her way. Idly, as not to seem as if she\u2019s hanging on every word of the conversation, Naoki casts her eyes about, observing the village. It is, after all, her first visit to the Celandine Village. And though she supposes, it is sort of simply just a little village, it\u2019s also a rather important little village in the grand scheme of things, and it would be a fine idea to gain an understanding of its people. However, one ear and the majority of Naoki\u2019s focus remains rigidly fixed on Kate and Jun, and she stands ready to interject or offer support as needed.", "1472160516000": "Following Kate into the tower, Naoki expresses mild curiosity, looking around every which way to properly observe their surroundings. It\u2019s interesting to see what all they have going on in here, what with the glyphs and such. Passing further down into the cookery, Naoki is both pleasantly surprised and mildly repulsed by what she finds. The room itself- the cookery, isn\u2019t the most terrible thing, and she finds its inherent warmness to be quite nice.However, the scent of fish is everywhere. Fresh fish, at that; the worst sort. Contrary to what one might assume, Naoki is in the \u201cDefinitely not a fan\u201d category when it comes to seafood. She finds the scent of it- especially in such quantity and a more or less unventilated room, to be quite frankly, rather nauseating. Unhinging her jaw slightly and parting her lips, Naoki employs a technique she learned long ago, and hasn\u2019t needed to in years. By breathing primarily through the mouth, pungent scents aren\u2019t quite as terrible, presumably because of the decreased airflow through the nose. This helps, but is only capable of so much when the air itself is seems to be suffused with scaly fish innards. As such, Naoki is less than fully aware of what all is going on, and only snaps back when Kate nudges her.\u201cSome leak?\u201d More or less blindsided by the request, Naoki takes a moment to reevaluate, reinterpret, and reassess the situation to figure out just what the heck all is going on. Only a moment, though. Without anything in particular to do or any real reason to deny Kate\u2019s suggestion, Naoki nods, accepting the great responsibility. \u201cOf course, the leeks.\u201dShuffling over to the indicated bag of leeks, Naoki decides to devote her attention wholeheartedly to ensuring that these leeks get chopped well, and that she doesn\u2019t regurgitate upon them during the process. That\u2019s a fine enough goal, she thinks.Quietly, she notes that this is an awful lot of leeks. A whole bag full, maybe thirty pounds worth. Some part of her mind registers that this is probably way too many leeks to reasonably fit in a stew. As such, she begins by selecting a few of the best looking leeks- those with the largest and clearest pale bits. Then, another handful, and another, until she has about ten.  Arms full of leeks, Naoki carefully proceeds over to what would seem like an area designed for washing and cutting things. What with a basin of clean water and knives and whatnot. Depositing her load onto the counter, Naoki begins by washing her hands; rinsing them in the water and drying them halfway with a nearby cloth probably intended for such a purpose. Next into the basin are the leeks, albeit one at a time. Dunking the vegetable in the water, Naoki uses her thumbs, primarily, to remove the dirt on the exterior and between the leaves. What a strange sort of plant, she muses, doing her very best not to pay attention to the fellow to her left, who would seem to be gutting some manner of fish. If she recalls correctly, it\u2019s in the same family of plant as onions, and garlic. What with the layers and the growing underground and such. Wish the first leek washed, she begins to form a second pile, for the clean leeks. Slowly and carefully, leeks move from one pile to the next, until the entire stack of leeks is about as clean as they\u2019re going to be without opening them.Next, Naoki supposes that she ought to chop them, as suggested. Leaning a bit close to the fellow gutting the fish, Naoki selects a knife more or less at random. (Why is he even handling raw fish in the same vicinity as the vegetables. Is she in the wrong spot? This is probably the fish area. Why hasn\u2019t anyone corrected her?)Focusing very intently, Naoki begins to take the knife to the leeks, starting by cutting the roots off each one and discarding the roots into what would seem to be a composting bin. Next, she makes an incision into each leek lengthwise, opening them up. With each step, Naoki processes her pile of leeks in tandem, performing each step to every leek before proceeding. Next, she washes the dirt out of the open leeks. What with being layered and growing in the earth, dirt tends to get all up in there, and she gets that right out. The open, clean leeks are then sliced thinly widthwise, and the little leek-bits are then slid from the cutting surface into a bowl. This leaves Naoki with only a bowl of perhaps two quarts worth of sliced leek bits in a bowl. Nodding slightly to herself, Naoki realizes that the fish-fellow has since finished his task and departed. Without any particular idea of what to do next, Naoki turns back about and moves to seek out Jun- who she hopes is responsible for the actual assembly of the stew, holding her bowl of leeks in two hands. ", "1472963585000": "\u201cAlright, alright\u2026\u201d Raising her hands in mock surrender, Naoki accepts the apron from Kate and holds it in one hand to examine it. Such things, what with their floral pink designs and overly feminine frills, are very much outside the realm of what Naoki would dress herself with. Very much the sort of thing Kate would probably wear; there isn\u2019t much of a difference between a cooking apron and a gardening apron anyway, Naoki assumes. Regardless, Naoki dons the apron at Kate\u2019s insistence, grumbling slightly but smirking the entire time. Looking a bit foolish is well worth it, Naoki decides, to see Jun- but more importantly, Kate, pleased. That, Naoki thinks, is a decision she would make every day of the week. Now wearing the frilled apron, Naoki resumes her work, taking the knife to any vegetables that may be placed before her. Occasionally, she glances in Kate\u2019s direction to see how she\u2019s faring, and then toward Jun, in an attempt to gauge just how many damn vegetables she\u2019s going to need for this stew. ", "1473457205000": "Taking her place at the table, Naoki spends a moment to absorb the atmosphere. What a peculiar sort of thing, she muses. What with the open air, and the stone tables all arranged out under the stars. The intermingling fragrances of the prepared dishes and the agrarian undertone permeating the village. The manner in which the whole village seems to be of one family, and the hospitality they exhibit to their guests. The whole thing is quite unlike any situation Naoki has found herself in to date and is certainly unlike anything that could be found in Isra. Though she isn\u2019t quite sure if she prefers it, Naoki is forced to inwardly admit that she finds it all quite pleasant. Gesturing dismissively with one hand, in response to Raynor\u2019s inquiry, Naoki responds under her breath, \u201cNo waxing will be necessary; I already am. Something short, but skillfully applied would be satisfactory.\u201d With this most blatant of jests and most atrocious alliteration, she serves Raynor a small smirk. With that said and her smirk still in place, Naoki turns to her other side to glance at Kate, intending to assess how she might be feeling. ", "1473533845000": "Chuckling along with the rest, Naoki accepts the toast graciously but doesn\u2019t offer a comment on the matter of fish. After others have begun to serve themselves, Naoki opts, to begin with a bowl of soup and finds it to be an interesting sort of thing. The coconut milk broth, combined with the spicy vegetables, makes for a funny sort of texture and leaves one hell of an aftertaste. Just as she\u2019s moving to wash it down with a cup of the ensalada, Naoki is approached with a gift. Accepting it, she offers her thanks and shakes the hand of the Tiller who gave it to her. A few moments later, another approaches, and Naoki repeats the procedure, and helps herself to a portion of wildebeest. The third time, she begins to notice a bit of a trend and begins to intentionally take small bites in between gifts, as not to be caught chewing each time. To each Tiller that approaches her, Naoki offers her heartfelt thanks and goes as far as to make a bit of small talk with each one, ask after their names, and offer handshakes, light hugs, and even a few cheek-kisses where they seem appropriate. At some point, Naoki is given a basket which seems to be hand-woven out of some manner of plant fiber, which she finds to be most useful of the items so far, as the other items can be easily held within. Onward in this manner, Naoki continues, accepting the gifts as they come, proceeding to partake in the banquet itself, and beaming the entire time, thoroughly enjoying the situation. ", "1474114059000": "Looking on as Kate and Jun socialise, Naoki nods slightly to herself, pleased. They\u2019re getting along about as well as she thought they would- which is to say, apparently pretty well. It\u2019ll remain to be seen how things develop- of course, but it\u2019s also good to see Kate interacting with another person, Naoki thinks. She and plant life alone don\u2019t offer a terribly broad worldview, after all. As Jun goes on to outline the significance of the trilobite, Naoki nods appreciatively to acknowledge Jun\u2019s insight, somewhat surprised with the depth of it. It\u2019s a sort of convoluted sort of thing, she thinks, wherein a trilobite has come to be representative of bravery against insurmountable odds. But it is what it is, she supposes; an interesting tidbit of culture and perhaps a reason to seek out the individual who gave it to her and perhaps offer them a more personal thanks- perhaps with Kate, and perhaps later in the evening, depending on how things progress. However, as Naoki nods in response to Kate\u2019s own, she supposes that their need for sleep might preclude- or at least postpone such shenanigans.\u201cIt is, yes. There\u2019s something to be appreciated in the history of it- not to mention the rarity of it. I\u2019ve never seen anything quite like it.  \u2026 It isn\u2019t nearly as pretty as your eyes, though.\u201dWith this comment delivered in a most factual sort of tone, Naoki returns the gemstone to the basket, not having anywhere else in particular to put it. As she turns her attention back to the plate before her, Naoki resolves to bring a gift for the Celandine people the next time she visits. Something big and symbolic, perhaps. On a related note, she also makes a note to attempt to pin down Raynor for a conversation at some point. It would likely be beneficial to befriend him, from a political standpoint at the very least, she figures.However, Naoki offers no further comments. Whether this is due to fatigue, her interest in the meal, or simply because she doesn\u2019t have anything to say is difficult to discern. She seems quite content to sit and listen, however. In addition to Kate and Jun\u2019s conversation, the other Celandines are leading some fairly interesting discussions, judging by the way Naoki\u2019s ears pivot around, listening in. ", "1474674406000": "Sitting in her place, Naoki doesn\u2019t have too much to offer for the remainder of the meal. In fact, one might get the impression that she\u2019s a bit subdued- perhaps not quite there, due to the relative infrequency with which she seems to be flirting and making dirty jokes. And while some component of that may be attributable to the post-\u2018Birthday Festivities\u2019-fatigue, an astute onlooker might note that her earring is frequently in a state of constant and furious gleaming. Kate may postulate a bit further if she were to be feeling so inclined, and get the feeling that Naoki may be hiding something. Still- as preoccupied as she may or may not be, Naoki does continue to listen on as conversations progress around her and finds it somewhat interesting to note that Kate seems to have a sentient plant. While such things aren\u2019t exactly unheard of- what with ents and forest spirits and what-have-you, Naoki is fairly certain that she would have remembered such a thing, having visited Green\u2019s Greens a fair few times. Perhaps it\u2019s shy. What\u2019s the proper noun to use in that case, Naoki wonders? Plants do technically have gender, she supposes, but\u2026 Dismissing the matter, she proceeds to nod in agreement with Kate\u2019s comment, confirming that yes, Kate will indeed need her sleep for tomorrow and the activities slated for it. ", "1475357487000": "After ensuring that her eating utensils are properly stacked to give the poor sods tasked with cleaning up the feast a slightly easier time, Naoki takes her basket in one hand, Kate\u2019s hand in the other, and follows her away from the feast area, toward the stone tower Jun indicated as having guest quarters within. Listening to what Kate has to say, Naoki nods thoughtfully in acknowledgement. Quietly, she wonders what all could be accomplished if they could coalesce love and respect into some magical effect. That would certainly be something. However, Naoki doesn\u2019t have much to add; The Tillers use all manners of magic to be as successful as they are, and that is \u2018The Secret of the Land Tillers.\u2019 There\u2019s not any more Naoki has to say about it, really. As attention is drawn to the basket, Naoki continues to nod. \u201cI wasn\u2019t expecting such generosity- especially with how we turned up unannounced. \u2026 We\u2019re going to have to return at some point with a gift for the Celandines. \u2026\u201d Naoki trails off, considering what might be appropriate. However, she only spends a moment in thought before continuing, \u201cHow was that for a birthday, though?\u201d With this, Naoki playfully wraps her tail around Kate\u2019s behind and flashes one of her trademark smirks. Between the bracelet, the quality time they spent together in the carriage, and dinner with The Celandines, Naoki is inclined to think that she did pretty well in terms of birthday festivities but is interested to see what Kate has to say about it all.", "1475726962000": "Though she isn\u2019t aware of Jun\u2019s approach until the last few moments, Naoki plays her surprise off well, only smacking Jun\u2019s abdomen with her tail before whipping around and realizing who it is. Huffing slightly as she takes a half step backward, Naoki listens on quietly as Jun voices her enthusiasm and Kate shuts her down. Nodding quietly, Naoki expresses her agreement with Kate on both counts, honestly somewhat surprised that Jun wasn\u2019t in any way deterred by Kate\u2019s band. Perhaps the enchantment is smarter than she thought. Regardless, it\u2019s about time for bed, and matters such as those, Naoki\u2019s preference is often, \u201cThe more the merrier\u201d. With this in mind, a plan forms. A devious plan, that ought to sort the matter out one way or another. Sporting a smirk, Naoki begins to articulate her idea, \u201cOh, you know what you ought to do, Jun?\u201dEyeing the Celandine woman with what could only be described as a predatory gaze, Naoki takes a step to the side, retaking Kate\u2019s hand in her own. \u201cYou ought to show us the guest quarters.\u201dExtending her tail from beneath the basket, Naoki would- if not stopped, wrap it twice around Jun\u2019s left wrist and with it, tug Jun along as she begins to take slow steps backward toward the stone tower. ", "1476031159000": "As Jun takes the lead, Naoki is content to follow and does so quietly, without comment or protest. Though she is a bit drowsy- so much can be seen in her less-than-bouncing steps, she seems more than anything to have an air of contentment about her. After all, today has been an excellent day, filled with lovemaking, good food, gifts, and most importantly, Kate\u2019s company throughout. Even though not too many words were shared directly, over the course of the day, there is, as Naoki has already recognized, simply something about Kate's presence that just really does it for her. It\u2019s probably the whole love bit, she supposes. Furthermore, the best bit, Naoki thinks- beyond what will hopefully become a bonus round with Jun, is that today has only been the first day of their trip, out of some indeterminate but hopefully somewhat large number. Silently, Naoki resolves that she really must pin Kate down in the strictly metaphorical sense for some conversation. Tomorrow, perhaps. Regardless, before long, Naoki finds herself as the last to enter the guest quarters. It\u2019s a neat enough little place, she supposes. Truthfully, she hadn\u2019t been expecting too much, but the room has a certain sort of warm, coziness to it that appeals to Naoki- bonus points for the fireplace. Definitely preferable to the cold, garish gold of Le Palais des Ailes. Naoki simply hopes that the bedding arrangements are large enough for the three of them. Closing the door behind her with a firm air of finality, Naoki looks on quietly as Kate approaches Jun. Knowing herself to only have one not-at-all-subtle setting when it comes to seduction and persuasion, Naoki opts to hang back for the moment, and wait to see how Jun takes to Kate\u2019s advance before potentially involving herself. As such, Naoki simply stands, leaning back against the door with that same sort of contented smile on her face.", "1477531816000": "Moving from the front door to the doorframe of the bedroom, Naoki looks on with some level of amusement as Jun putters about, setting the mood. It seems as if Jun is only partially cognizant of her and Kate\u2019s intentions. Which is somewhat amusing, Naoki thinks, even though the continued delay is not. There\u2019s also something to be said, Naoki thinks, for the room itself. For the sort of honesty it has, and the relative simplicity of it. The way everything seems to have been made by hand, and with loving care. It\u2019s a different sort of coziness than the clean, perfect sort at The Chalet, and one that would probably be all but impossible to replicate, she muses. Those things aside, however, it seems like Kate will not be deterred! Remaining an observer for the moment, Naoki finds the spectacle unfolding before her to be both highly arousing and somewhat alarming. Has Kate always been able to do that sort of thing? Thinking about it, Naoki supposes that she hasn\u2019t really needed to. In almost all cases that come to mind, Kate hasn't needed to persuade her- only provide an excuse. Still, it certainly is something to watch Kate at work. But Naoki didn\u2019t come just to watch. Acting on Kate\u2019s suggestion, Naoki crosses over to the other side of the mattress and slides herself up onto it. From there, she scoots over to position herself behind Jun, seating herself cross-legged to face Kate with Jun between them. Leaning to one side to speak toward Jun\u2019s ear- but not quite into it- Naoki\u2019s tone is light and more friendly than sultry, \u201cNamely, I insist on giving you a massage.\u201d Assuming that Jun hasn\u2019t yet run screaming out of the room, Naoki would proceed to- after cracking her knuckles, place her hands on Jun\u2019s shoulder-blades, and begin to knead gently. \u201cOh- you\u2019re all tense\u2026\u201d Even through the fabric, Naoki\u2019s hands would seem warm, as she usually tends to be. If not stopped, she will continue her kneading motions, doing what she can to loosen up Jun\u2019s shoulders while Jun is sitting up, and through her clothes. Considering that in the process of giving massages, some force is applied, Jun might find herself pushed into Kate, or at least unable to back away quite so easily.", "1481346555000": "Still content to follow Kate\u2019s lead, Naoki withdraws her hands shuffles backward on her knees a bit to move away and give Jun enough room to lie down as Kate said. Naoki\u2019s position would - if Jun proceeds to lie face-down with her head on the pillows of the bed - put Naoki parallel to Jun\u2019s waist on Jun\u2019s right side. Without anything much more to do for the moment or any particular\u00a0thoughts on the proceedings so far besides \"Yes\", Naoki simply observes the pair of them, Kate and Jun. As far as things to observe go, Naoki thinks, this isn\u2019t bad. A bit too much fabric, but not bad. In anticipation, Naoki runs the tip of her tongue across her upper lip, looking to make eye contact with Kate with that particular sort of smirk she has a habit of wearing in situations such as this.", "1485450871000": "Smirk widening, Naoki leans forward slightly to respond to Jun, speaking  \u201cNoooono-no, no. Clearly not. She learned from the best.\u201dA moment afterward, Naoki's smirk becomes somewhat strained, upon the realization that \u2018the best\u2019 regrettably, isn\u2019t among them. Hoping that the pair of them are too engrossed to take any particular note of this, Naoki does what she can to push the matter from her mind and focus on the events unfolding before her. And focus she does, with equal parts arousal and careful assessment of Kate\u2019s technique. Finding the oil isn\u2019t any trouble - it turns out that those thoughtful Celandines left some in the bedside table, right there within arm\u2019s reach. Naoki is forced to give them yet more credit; The Celandines are turning out to be by far the best hosts she\u2019s had the pleasure of staying with. But, Kate\u2019s massage... it\u2019s not bad. Kate seems to have the movements down; the specific ways in which pressure is applied, with the balance between pressure and tenderness and all that. Though, the overall progression of the massage is questionable, the oil really should have been applied first, and Naoki doubts that tapotement really should have been used at all, but this is hardly the time to offer any sort of critique. She\u2019s a bit preoccupied trying to keep her hands to herself, anyway. So, for the time being, Naoki does her best to remain more or less where she is, continuing to keep both Kate and Jun within arm\u2019s reach, and continuing to contemplate just what, exactly, she\u2019s going to do to the pair of them when the time comes.", "1485842529000": "Quirking an eyebrow, Naoki is immediately suspicious. That\u2019s a tone of voice Naoki hasn\u2019t heard Jun use at any point. Naoki wholly suspects Jun to pull some manner of stunt, as is her modus operandi, and this seems like the setup. Despite that, Naoki shuffles forward and can do little besides shouting in alarm as the light construct forcefully pushes her in the manner Jun intended. This movement leaves her face down, with Jun to her left and Kate probably somewhere behind or to Jun's left.  As soon as she\u2019s able to, Naoki moves immediately to the right with as much force as she, in her adrenaline high, can. She pushes and turns, pushing off of Jun, pushing off the bed, pulling on the edge of the bed with her right hand, obtaining as much leverage as she\u2019s able to. She intends to pull away and turn her left shoulder toward the ceiling in such a manner that then rips her light blouse off her, shedding it to escape Jun's grasp, hopefully.", "1486245823000": "Having scrambled free, Naoki nearly rolls off the side of the bed onto the floor but manages to get her feet underneath her and stands up. Still very much panicked, she doesn\u2019t stop moving until she\u2019s far from the bed, standing just on the inside of the doorway leading back out into the living room. Here, she pauses, clutching the doorframe with one hand to heave a few deep breaths. It would become apparent at this point that Naoki was not wearing anything in particular under her blouse, which remains with Jun on the bed.After a moment, she releases her hold on the doorframe and turns back about to face the bed. Raising her left hand, Naoki points a single index finger toward Jun in what she intends to be an angry, threatening manner. The expression she carries is a new one, the likes of which probably hasn\u2019t been seen by either Kate or Jun, as it is an expression of raw and untempered anger. With her ears flattened against the top of her head, eyebrows stiff and mouth firmly in a line, it would seem as if Naoki is highly upset. As further evidence toward this, she is breathing heavily through her mouth, her tail has poofed up, and is lashing from side to side.Cutting Jun off before she can properly finish speaking, Naoki begins to shout, \u201cOh, I\u2019m SURE, I\u2019m suuuuure...! Don\u2019t tell me, though! Don\u2019t say, \u2018I am going to massage you\u2019! And don\u2019t ask me - don\u2019t ask, \u2018May I massage you?\u2019 Noo-no-no, no, don\u2019t do that!\u201dTo punctuate this sentence, Naoki lifts one foot and slams it back down onto the floor with force enough to cause a few items sitting upon a nearby cabinet to jump. Nearly spitting the words at this point, bitter sarcasm and contempt are nearly dripping from her words.\u201cWhat I really like, what really does it for me, what really turns me on, is when I\u2019m surprised with brute force, pushed face-down onto the bed, and seized from behind! The next thing you ought to do is bind my hands and feet, gag me, and then jam me full of your damn light constructs!\u201dThat seems to be about all Naoki has to offer for the moment, because she abruptly turns and stomps out into the living room without another word, leaving Jun and Kate there in the bedroom with her yelling ringing in their ears.If anyone might opt to follow Naoki out into the living room, they would find her sitting in the room\u2019s largest chair, feet up, knees bent. Her tail is wrapped about her feet, arms wrapped around her knees. In front of her, the fireplace Jun lit continues to crackle and burn, and Naoki stares into it blankly, without moving or making a sound.Off in the shadows in one corner of the room, an individual of indistinct gender whose scarf identifies them as a Senior Sun Marshal stands quietly, apparently having entered at some point - perhaps in response to the shouting. ", "1486452073000": "Naoki offers no rebuttal and doesn\u2019t even so much turn her head to look at Jun, only flattening her ears further and wincing slightly at the sound of the yelling. As Kate enters the room, leaves toward the bathroom, and then returns, Naoki still has nothing to offer and remains seated silently as she is, save for a bit of stifled sobbing. While Kate is approaching, she would be able to see that in contrast to the manner in which she holds herself, Naoki\u2019s expression is largely blank. The only particularly pronounced features are how widely her eyes seem to be open, and how tightly her mouth seems to be shut. However, it wouldn\u2019t be an unreasonable conclusion to reach that this is intentional on Naoki\u2019s part, as an attempt to hide her emotions. Still, there isn\u2019t any apparent anger to be seen, and she\u2019s not a weeping mess quite yet. As Kate moves into her field of view, Naoki looks up at her with the blank expression. She opens her mouth, with the intention of saying something, but the words catch in her throat, and Naoki abandons the effort, only shifting slightly as to better allow Kate to cover her with the towel. Silently, Naoki wonders, \u2018why a towel?\u2019 There ought to be plenty of blankets around, she thinks. The focus of her attention shifts as Kate turns away, and Naoki realizes she\u2019s made her cry. This proves to be the final straw needed to completely shatter Naoki\u2019s remaining composure. Pressing her face down into the towel as it rests atop her knees, begins to cry and wail in a decidedly uncharacteristic and unladylike manner. It doesn\u2019t seem as if she can help it, at this point. Without pausing or raising her head, Naoki waves toward the Sun Marshal with one hand, making shooing motions in their general direction. The Sun Marshal interprets this as their cue to leave, and seeing as how the potential danger seems to have passed, sees no reason not to do so. They move silently to the door leading out into the hallway and use it to exit, making sure that it shuts quietly and securely behind them. ", "1486721078000": "It takes Naoki a few minutes to stop, and when it does, it doesn't quite seem as if she\u2019s finished crying as much as much as she\u2019s managed to get a handle on it and force herself to stop for the time being.\u201cAlright,\u201d she says, using a portion of the blanket to dry her face.\u201cAlright\u2026 This is what we\u2019re going to do.\u201d Apparently having gathered up some composure up off the floor, Naoki speaks with some level of confidence.\u201cFirst, I\u2019m going to say two things. Then, I\u2019m going to kiss you. After that, we\u2019ll sleep, and tomorrow morning, before we go galavanting around The Expanse, we\u2019re going to talk, because there are things that we need to discuss, but it\u2019s late, a- ...\u201dStopping somewhat abruptly, it seems as if Naoki had more of that sentence to say, but stopped herself. Turning her head slightly to one side to look at Kate, she raises a single index finger and proceeds, \u201cFirst thing: Jun is a filthy, hypocrite. I have attempted to bed her once before, at The Eclipse. The emphasis is on \u2018attempted\u2019, as she turned me down and I didn\u2019t push the matter. \u2026 Much. \u2026 But if at any point I had tried to be \u2018rough\u2019 with her, she would have blasted me all over the ceiling! Yet- she apparently thinks it acceptable to trick me, and use her magics to manhandle me!\"Here, a bit of that previous anger flares back up, but only for a moment before Naoki lowers her voice and continues, \"I\u2019ll admit that I expect a fairly high level of respect, but no more than I have given her, and no more than I expect from anyone else. If she had been more overt in implying her intentions beforehand, or if she had asked first, I could have dealt with being pushed around. \u2026 But the manner in which she forced me down and seized my shoulders reminded me of\u2026 of some very painful memories, and I panicked and got upset.\u201dApparently satisfied with this explanation, Naoki nods slightly to herself, before opening her mouth as if to add something, but stops to consider. The last person who had attempted to handle her in such a manner was actually smeared across a ceiling, but given the unpleasant flavor of the memory, who exactly had done the smearing, and bearing in mind the second thing she intends to say, Naoki decides not to mention that, shutting her mouth. ", "1487117702000": "Nodding slightly along, Naoki feels no need to verbally respond to what Kate has to say. It is Naoki\u2019s thought that responsibility for the incident can be placed squarely and only on her own shoulders. Were someone else in her place, had she not had the memories she does, or had she been able to not overreact in the manner she did, things would have proceeded along just as everyone would have liked. Naoki finds it difficult to fault Jun for doing what she thought natural and acceptable toward an end she had previously expressed heavy interest in, but that also makes it all but impossible to distribute the blame, which in turn weighs somewhat heavily. Especially so because things were shaping up toward a fantastic series of climaxes to conclude the birthday festivities.But Naoki takes the comforting words for what they are, and they\u2019re effective, as are the physical affections. It\u2019s difficult to remain very upset with anything for too long with things as they are, and very easy to transition directly into the second item, which Naoki proceeds to do without any further ado. Turning her entire upper body to the one side toward Kate, Naoki makes eye contact, and opens her mouth to say, \u201cThe second thing is something I\u2019ve already told you, something I\u2019ll tell you again, and it\u2019ll be true every time: I love you too.\u201dWith that and simply that, Naoki would lean in, with the intention to stifle any verbal response Kate might have to offer with her lips.", "1487341699000": "For a moment after pulling away, Naoki remains lost, lingering in the moment and the comfort therein. The expression of the simple exchange of loving and being loved seems to have been exactly the right sort of thing to ease the pain.What Kate says next, however, isn\u2019t quite in as perfect alignment with Naoki\u2019s thoughts, and so much is evident for a moment in the form of a slightly quirked eyebrow and Naoki\u2019s mouth pulled over to one side. But she transitions quickly out of this to an outward expression of teasingly exaggerated exasperation, rolling her eyes.\u201cYou are absolutely insatiable,\u201d she says, though her tone of voice is implicative of the fact that that\u2019s exactly how she likes it.For a moment, though, Naoki considers. Were her preference the only factor, she would opt for sleeping now and saving the lovemaking for the following morning. She woke up rather early, spent the majority of the day engaged in the intense aerobic activity of keeping Kate moaning the entire way over from Isra, and as a result is drained. Honestly, she\u2019s mildly surprised Kate still has energy left for such an activity. But then, Naoki supposes that she slept in, and probably intends to milk her birthday for everything it\u2019s worth. But\u2026 it is her birthday, Naoki supposes, and though there is a first time for everything, today would not be the first day she declines such an offer. Such is her conscious reasoning, at least. As such, Naoki adopts a smirk of her own\u00a0and begins to stand up. No further response is needed, she thinks. Leading the way back into the bedroom, she sheds her remaining garments along the way, as it is isn't needed either.", "1488384477000": "Though not quite fully awake, Naoki seems to be conscious enough to adjust herself in the bed to nuzzle up into the hand at her ear. \u201cMyyyuuuh,\u201d vocalises Naoki, stretching slightly before curling back up. Despite how tired she had been at the conclusion of last night\u2019s activities, the quality of the sleeping arrangements, and of course the comfort of present company, she hasn\u2019t slept well and is decidedly less than fully rested. So much is apparent in the manner in which she tossed and turned all night, and the apparent drowsiness. \u201cAlright,\u201d she mumbles, eyes still shut, \u201cIf you say so.\u201dHowever, having said this, Naoki doesn\u2019t seem to be moving. Sliding one hand just barely out from under the covers, she raises a single finger in the air in a manner that she intends to come off as assertive, and continues sleepily, \u201cHowever, I am going to sit you down to talk about things today.\u201dWithdrawing her hand, Naoki uses it to slide the blanket up further, to cover her neck.After allowing a few moment to pass in silence, \u201c... I\u2019ve got bad news,\u201d she states quietly, with no hints of drowsiness.", "1488757896000": "\u201cAlright. \u2026 I\u2019ll... sit here quietly,\u201d Naoki responds.And so she does, right up until the door closes behind behind Kate, at which point Naoki opens her eyes, stares blankly ahead, and sighs. That had, predictably, put a damper on Kate\u2019s mood. Which is why she had saved it for the morning, but in hindsight, she probably should have saved it for after breakfast as well. \u201cDamn it.\u201dAfter lying there for a few moments longer, Naoki decides that she will make the most of this time she has to herself to think. To think, and to clean up. Rising from the bed with no great enthusiasm, she plods her way to the room\u2019s washing area, with the intention to wash the stickiness off her face. By the time anyone returns to the room, Naoki will be seated in the same large armchair she chose the previous evening, wrapped tightly in a blanket up to her neck, looking straight ahead, contemplating the intricacies of the blank wall in front of her.[Feel free to skip my turns until returning to the room]", "1489711021000": "Naoki manages to offer a weak imitation of a smile in greeting as Kate reenters the room, but it can\u2019t quite mask her underlying state of distress. Though she wasn\u2019t entirely prepared to have fruit thrown at her so early in the morning, Naoki, after only a bit of fumbling, catches the thing. For a moment, Naoki looks at it, unfamiliar with what exactly it is and unsure what she\u2019s expected to do with it. Looking over, it seems like Kate is peeling hers, so Naoki opts to follow suit, and begins talking as she does so, \u201cMmmh. \u2026 That\u2019s good. Later today, I guess. \u2026 You\u2019ll recall that yesterday, I mentioned that Artemis was having some indigestion, and would be staying in the carriage.\u201d\u201cThat was entirely correct, but not the entirety of the truth. As you\u2019ll further recall, she isn\u2019t quite as... natural as most people tend to be. Though it pains me to say this, she could be likened as just easily to a wizard\u2019s golem as she could to a someone such as yourself, if one is speaking in a purely physiological sense. And while this does grant her the superhuman abilities and such, the other side of that coin is that her body does not... it doesn\u2019t last, as it were.\u201dThe manner in which Naoki is peeling the fruit is slow, precise, and methodical, removing equally sized portions of the fruit\u2019s skin and stacking them up nearly on the arm of the chair. She seems to be devoting a relatively large portion of her attention to the activity, given that she\u2019s ostensibly maintaining a conversation. \u201cTo be more specific, it - her body - it ages quickly, some parts of it, and the parts that can heal, and regrow themselves don\u2019t do so quite correctly. Hasdrubal used to do what he would call \u2018maintenance,' and Artemis insisted that it helped. Her ability to heal wounds is extraordinary but won\u2019t work on small cuts and the like. One one occasion, she was able to regrow her whole arm past the elbow, but lately, she\u2019s been having vision problems, stomach issues, and awful headaches. \u2026 I\u2019m not explaining this clearly, am I. \u2026 I never looked too far into the matter, so I don\u2019t quite know what all is going on - and I regret that now, I thought we had more time - but the point that I\u2019m getting at here is that the effective lifespan of Artemis\u2019 body has turned out to be about ten years.\u201dAt this point, Naoki stops both speaking and peeling the fruit. Speaking, mostly because she hasn\u2019t figured out any more words to use, and peeling because there isn\u2019t any more skin on the fruit to peel off. Now she sits quietly, peeled fruit held awkwardly in one hand, with a somewhat strained expression and her tongue between her teeth, looking in Kate\u2019s general direction.", "1490438320000": "Silently, with her eyes held shut and her lips clamped together, Naoki shakes her head. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried.\u201dNothing to do, nothing to be done, not in the last few months leading up to today, or now, after the fact. It was a case of all the king\u2019s horses and all the king\u2019s men being inadequate. Or, a case of all the top medical and magical minds of the world being unable to understand and repair the creation of a dead man, depending on how literal one would like to be. \u201cI hope you don\u2019t mind if I omit the details\u2026\" Naoki begins, \"She was not feeling well yesterday. When we were exiting the carriage, she was not in a state to follow. She suggested that you and I go ahead, and we did. In the past, her problems have been mostly episodic, and not lasting for very long. She would have them and get over them over the course of an hour or two, and then be more or less alright for the rest of the day, at least.\u201dPulling her legs up onto the seat, Naoki wraps the tip of her tail around her feet and folds her arms atop her knees, doing what she can to seem small.\u201cShe fell unconscious, and I sent her back to Isra by griffin. As we were eating dinner, she was under the care of every single individual I thought may have been able to help. \u2026 An awful lot of gold changed hands yesterday. But none of them were able to stabilize her in the\u2026 traditional sort of manner that would have her conscious, back on her feet. \u2026 I settled for what amounts to a spell of deep sleep. Though she isn\u2019t getting any better, Artemis also isn\u2019t getting any worse. She just\u2026 sleeps. As if frozen. ... There\u2019s apparently some time magic involved. In the night, I had her moved to The Chalet, and the man responsible for the spell is now excessively contracted, so events have stopped transpiring, at least...\u201d\u201cBut that doesn\u2019t change the fact that when I reach out...\u201d Naoki extends one hand out into the open air as if reaching for someone else\u2019s hand. Simultaneously, her earring begins to glow, before abruptly fading out as her her arm collapses against the side of the chair.\u201c...she\u2019s not there,\u201d Naoki finishes weakly.", "1491067311000": "Naoki inhales sharply. Loved. The word seems to reverberate, the past tense stings. This time only yesterday, all was well. Artemis was just departing to pick up the birthday bracelet from Dawnfire Forges. Now, here we are, using words like \u201cloved.\u201d It was only yesterday! Using the past tense, with its \u201cloved,\u201d its \u201cwas,\u201d and its \u201cused to be\u201ds, so soon is far too much, far too quickly, Naoki finds; and is enough to inspire her to plant her face down into the blanket covering her knees and sob silently into it.Even so, Kate\u2019s point regarding holing up in the room is a valid one, and for as easy is it is to drown in misery, there are more productive things to do. That's what she tells herself, at least. As such, Naoki does what she can to sequester those past tense thoughts away with all of the rest. It's beginning to get crowded over there, where she keeps the bad feelings, but this is just another handful for the pile. After taking a few moments to wipe at her face and take a few shaky breaths, Naoki rises unsteadily to her feet. \u201cAlright,\u201d Naoki offers, though it comes out as more of a croak than anything else. It\u2019s clear that she\u2019s going to need a few moments at least to dress, so without anything further beyond clearing her throat, Naoki presses per lips very tightly together and turns to enter the bedroom behind them, to set about getting ready. As she does, Naoki opts to occupy her mind by considering the rest of Kate's statement, about \"everybody who still remains.\" She considers just who all is relying on her, and what mechanisms are in place to take over should she fail. And then she consider who she needs to keep going. And what a terribly, terribly fragile structure that is. Her conclusion is that fear is awfully effective when it comes to overcoming grief, and she damn well better stay strong because the backup plans are awful.\u00a0The process takes only a few minutes and includes a particular set of stretches that Naoki last employed under very similar circumstances in the past. By the time she\u2019s finished, Naoki is presentable and has schooled her facial expression appropriately. Among the clothing she opted to pack, Naoki has chosen to dress in a dark gray sweater and one of her many dark-colored, tightly fitted trousers. It is admittedly somewhat warm to be wearing a sweater, but such trivialities have not bothered Naoki in the past. \u201cIf anyone asks,\u201d Naoki begins, \u201cShe is unwell.\u201d Judging by the tone used, this seems to be a declaration as well as a way of indicating that she isn\u2019t going to be speaking about the lack of Artemis\u2019 presence with others, full stop.Dropping that tone entirely for a softer one, Naoki continues, \u201cWith that said, I\u2019m about as ready as I will be.\u201d Though she isn't able to feign enthusiasm, Naoki seems willing enough to go speak with Jun, and would follow Kate if lead.", "1492233961000": "At almost every moment, Naoki, though her movement and expression, is attempting to express something, or accomplish something. To display an emotion of hers, to inspire a feeling in others, or otherwise suit her ends. In this case, however, Naoki moves only for the sake of moving. As invited, she enters Jun\u2019s room, nods her greeting, has a brief glance around, and sits on one side of the couch.In response to Jun\u2019s nervous smile, Naoki smirks a bit to herself, not necessarily toward anyone in particular. It\u2019s a mildly encouraging sign, she thinks. Seeing as how Jun is apparently ready to make up so soon, as long as this conversation goes well, things (at least in this regard) should hopefully turn out more or less okay, and there's something positive to be said for that.After Jun stops speaking, Naoki allows the silence to persist for one, two, three beats. Then she begins without preamble, \u201cAllow me to apologize for my overreaction. I was surprised, and what I did, yelling at you as I did, was unwarranted. If I had stopped once I was out of the bed and continued in a calm and controlled manner from that point, the situation wouldn\u2019t have become an issue, and we wouldn\u2019t be having this discussion. I apologize for getting as upset as I did, raising my voice, and for what I said. It was unnecessary. I ought to have been able to control myself; I ought to have stopped myself before saying what I said.\u201dThe manner in which Naoki is speaking is calm, measured, and certainly polite, but not impassioned. She\u2019s articulating her apology and appears to be sincere in doing so, but isn\u2019t making a performance of it.\u201cBut I did not, and for this I am sorry. It not only ruined last night,\u201d Glancing to the side, Naoki also directs that comment in Kate\u2019s direction, before returning her focus ahead. \u201cBut has also created this divide between you and I based on something as foolish as an overreaction. To digress for just a moment - and I mean nothing by this - but if you and I must be at odds, Jun, I would rather we be at odds over something substantial. Some issue of policy, a troubling decision, or a major event, perhaps. My loss of self-control was the cause of last night's escalation, and I am upset with myself for this. It was not my intention to be hurtful, and it is my hope that you and I will be able to resolve this fully.\u201dAt this point, Naoki stops speaking. She has more to say, and so much so is evident, but so much is the extent of her apology for her actions. Assuming that Jun would like to go \u2018next,' she offers nothing more for the time being, and merely inclines her head and sighs slightly to conclude her piece.", "1493304583000": "As Jun offers what she has t0o say, Naoki listens placidly, holding her hands in her lap. At Jun\u2019s mention of not having any interest and Kate\u2019s following glare, Naoki shifts uncomfortably and draws her mouth over to one side of her face. So much was not clearly communicated in the past, and Naoki doesn\u2019t think that she can be held particularly accountable for coaxing Jun into last night\u2019s situation. She would have stopped at a verbal objection from Jun at any point, but continued because Jun seemed to be receptive, and her back was full of knots. Once Jun seems to be finished, Naoki breaks eye contact, to look off to the side, into thought. What Jun has said contextualizes much of her behavior. The last statement, \u201cI'm afraid of you,\u201d is somewhat\u2026 difficult to digest, Naoki finds. She feels the need to address this directly but now isn\u2019t the time.\u201cAllow me to share this\u2026\u201dPausing, Naoki takes a breath and examines a pattern on the floor as she collects her thoughts in preparation to voice them. \u201cYou\u2019ll recall what I have told you about my \u2018family\u2019.\u201d Naoki\u2019s intonation implies her loose usage of the word, but means no offense to present company or anyone else in particular, and only intends to reference her lack of a traditional familial structure. \u201cTo massively over-summarize, I have not always had such a high degree of control as I do today. Though I prefer not to think about it, for a time, I had very limited control over my life, to such an extent that I was held against my will, and made to do things without my consent.\"Pausing, Naoki holds Jun's gaze for a moment, allowing the context of the conversation to fill in the details from there. \"Last night, as I was pushed down into the bed, I was rather forcibly reminded of those times, and that prompted my reaction, so I believe I can relate to you in that respect.\u201dHaving resolved not to monolog without when it wouldn\u2019t be inappropriate to do so, Naoki stops there for the moment and listens on as Jun continues.", "1496376601000": "Listening to Jun\u2019s story, Naoki nods somberly in acknowledgment. There is common ground on at least that, Naoki figures, the strong desire not to be taken advantage of. For several moments after Kate\u2019s remark, Naoki remains silent, choosing her words.  \u201cRight,\u201d says Naoki, with some measure of confidence. Shifting slightly to address Jun directly, she continues, \u201cAllow me, now, to say that I have no hard feelings, and cannot justify holding any against you. As I see it, you had no such malice in mind. You meant to do as you have done, and not be pushed to the bottom by what you saw as an attempt of mine to undermine your autonomy. Your shouting and harsh words were only in response to my own- an appropriate response, for which I can\u2019t blame you. Though perhaps you could have responded differently and de-escalated the situation, it would be unreasonable of me to expect you to. \u201d Though still not quite smiling, the corners of her mouth are turned slightly upward, and she nods solidly at the conclusion of her statement in an attempt to convey good faith. For another moment, she hesitates, unsure if she should go on at all, but decides to. \u201cI feel as if I owe an explanation. \u2026 My conscious intention, why I have been trying to tempt you into bed has not been out of any desire of mine to dominate, to violate, or \u2018take control of your destiny.' That would be exceedingly hypocritical of me. I never- never have, and would never force myself upon someone, having been a victim of such things myself.\u201d Without dwelling on that for more than a single beat, she continues, \u201cBut I tempt. I charm, I seduce, and I\u2019m not above thinly veiled excuses to remove clothing. I would be lying if I said that my motivations were entirely pure, but I do it because\u2026\u201d Naoki hesitates, rolling her shoulders as she searches for the right words. \u201cBecause I care. I am a woman- a sensual woman, who loves to be loved and loves to love. I have the ability to gratify and satisfy like none other, and I want to use that to bring ecstasy those I care about. The reason I have chased you so is that I want to bring it to you- as an expression of my feelings and as a service. Some people make their friends gifts- they bake cakes, or give flowers. ... I make my friends walk funny.\u201d After pausing for a few moments to smirk slightly, she adds, \u201cAnd again I would be lying through my teeth if I said that my immodest motivations are ever entirely selfless, I don\u2019t mean to feign that pretense. It would be false to say that I don\u2019t find you attractive and admire your wonderfully shaped behind, or that I don\u2019t deeply regret ruining the opportunity that was last night.\u201d In speaking now, she seems both shameless and sincere, proceeding directly without so much as a second thought. \u201cBut it has never been my intention to make you feel uncomfortable, pursue you as a \u2018conquest\u2019 or anything of the sort. I apologize that I came off as\u2026 as predatory, and seeking your submission. In hindsight, I ought to have abandoned my efforts after your first refusal. Or the second. Had I known all this at the time, I would have- and communicated more clearly. But I interpreted your evasiveness as related to your then-lover, and then as an unwillingness to try something \u2018new,' with someone like me.\u201d Bouncing slightly in her seat, Naoki sets her chest in motion, an exceedingly obvious indication of her femininity.  \u201cBut most change their minds on that topic verrrry quickly once I have the chance to convince them, so I pressed. ... However. Now that you have made your stance clear to me and stated you are uninterested, I will- of course, cease to seek intimacy with you.\u201d", "1498460978000": "Taken aback by Jun\u2019s words and the sudden hug, Naoki has nothing to say. She tries a few times. Moving as if to speak but reconsidering. Then Kate\u2019s implication registers with Naoki, and she seems for a moment almost distressed, before recovering and offering a response.\u201cEhhum\u2026 Right.\u201d Unable to look either of them in the eye, Naoki   Reseating herself, Naoki nods and swallows. In a thinly veiled shift in topic, she continues, \u201cIn any case, Jun, I\u2019m glad to have put that behind us. If there\u2019s anything I can do for you, please- let me know. Whatever you need, I\u2019ll have it done.\u201d That being stated, Naoki begins to turn away, but stops mid-motion to turn back and brandish a single finger at Jun, adding, \u201cAnd go and get a massage from someone; you should have one.\u201d \u201cBut that\u2019s beside the point.\u201d Turning now to face Kate, Naoki makes an exaggerated, theatrical gesture toward the windows and the sky outside, as if presenting the whole world to her. \u201cThe entirety of The Expanse sits before us; now that we\u2019ve arrived, how would you deign to spend this day, o, Lady, love of my life?\u201d She smirks, evidently finding some amusement in the overblown routine.", "1500568802000": "As eager to move on as the others, Naoki is glad to be led and follows happily. Out in the sun, looking on quietly as Kate interrogates the populace, Naoki begins to get the feeling that the trip proper has now started. Out here, hundreds of miles away from any stately\u00a0obligations, there\u2019s a certain sense of silence that's unfamiliar. No one ringing in her earring, no meetings to attend. Not today, not tomorrow, or even the day after. It\u2019s an unusual feeling, Naoki finds.Naoki also begins to get the feeling that she should have brought a hat. It\u2019s awfully damn bright out here. Soon enough, they are upon the crates. As the ducks emerge and spread across the lake, Naoki\u2019s ears move quickly, turning toward the source of each quack.\u201cDucks.\u201d She states the obvious. And such ducks, at that; among the best looking ducks Naoki has seen to date. That\u2019s something about Gauldin, she supposes. Everything is far fancier than it needs to be. And it seems the birds are no exception.Having run afowl of a rotten duck once before, Naoki isn\u2019t entirely keen to approach closer than a few feet. As such, she stands a bit behind Kate and meets the gaze of the audacious duck. It seems shady. Naoki looks down the end of her nose toward it, unblinking. What, duck? Have you something to say?", "1502312502000": "As the duck steps toward her Naoki steps away, awkwardly backpedaling a few feet. \u201cNo, nonononono, nuhno, no- stoppit\u2026!\u201d But the duck is faster. Within a matter of moments, it is upon her, flapping and snapping like the vile beast it is. Naoki waves at it, trying to shoo it off as she starts to throw expletives at it. In spite of her efforts, it manages to get a mouthful of fur, eliciting a yelp of pain and anger - not the most ladylike noise Naoki has ever made. Drawing one leg back, she winds up with the intention to punt the damn thing into the pond.Before Naoki can complete the movement, Kate intervenes in a decidedly less violent manner and drives the thing off. To be on the safe side, Naoki takes several more steps away from the offending duck and the pond in a general sense, clutching her tail to her chest. Ears flattened against the top of her head, Naoki furrows her brow and spits in the duck's general direction.\u201cIt bit me,\u201d Naoki says in response, giving said duck the sourest of sour looks. \u201cRotten, rotten, creatures. \u2026 Just like chickens.\u201d Silently, she begins to consider how petty it might be to order it such that it is served as their dinner tonight, if anyone would be upset if she did, and if she's willing to do it regardless. ", "1507233915000": "Naoki\u2019s eyebrows furrow with something akin to discomfort as the fur on her tail returns. A strange and not wholly pleasant feeling, that. The sensation of hair growing so quickly. Spending a moment to examine the site, Naoki is surprised to find... nothing. Her tail seems just as it was, just as it ought to be.\u201cMmmh\u2026 my thanks,\u201d Naoki supposes aloud. Talk of the beast\u2019s intentions falls on deaf ears, though those same ears perk at the mention of going somewhere else. That seems like an excellent idea.There ought not to be any damn birds over there, one would hope. More likely, there would be hot springs, scantily clad elves, and quiet places suitable for recreational massaging - all of which Naoki can get behind. Though still slightly ruffled, Naoki smiles and nods her agreement. \u201cBy all means,\u201d she says, \u201cLet\u2019s.\u201d", "1539741619000": "The door is opened by a page-boy on his way out, having just delivered tea. Inside, The Empress is seated on one side, tea in-hand.

Where are you from, and how did you end up working for the Foreign Service?\u201d", "1539831107000": "The Empress murmurs acknowledgment, surprised to hear of Iulia\u2019s connection to Zemp. That explains much.\u201cI imagine he was a good mentor,\u201d Naoki responds, accepting a refill on her tea.\u201cI wanted to ask that,\u201d she continues,\u201d because I was curious, we haven\u2019t had the opportunity to chat. But I also wanted to do a debriefing on the feast. It was certainly an event, wasn\u2019t it?\u201dShe scoffs, shaking her head.\u201cI followed what was said.\u201d she continues, giving Iulia a significant look, \u201cBut I\u2019d like your impressions on those in attendance and the events that transpired.\u201d", "1539906576000": "The Empress cracks a wry smile but doesn\u2019t laugh at what was ostensibly a joke on Iulia\u2019s part.\u201cI think I got a very good sense of what sort of man Konrad is. If I were in his position, I would be disappointed that the turnout was so small. He would have benefited much from making alliances with states similar in size to his own; as it stands, he\u2019s more or less at my mercy.\u201d\u201cI regret not having the opportunity to speak much with the other guests,\u201d Naoki continues, looking out the window with a contemplative expression. \u201cI\u2019m considering the idea of hosting a feast myself for that purpose.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019ll remain to be seen how things play out from here.

Her first thoughts were in the short term, in how Warren is now an excellent captive and how that grants her still more leverage over Konrad, but Iulia is right. That conditioning will need to be done by those working with him, and she makes a mental note to express that end goal to them in their instructions.In response to Iulia\u2019s last comment, Naoki is quiet for a moment, then chuckles very much to herself. \u201cWhile we\u2019re on the topic,\u201d she begins, setting her teacup aside, \u201clet me ask this. What makes you think that I harbor a \u2018deep vengeful streak\u2019 toward my enemies?\u201dNaoki purposely waits for Iulia to begin speaking before interrupting her. \u201cNo \u2014 better question: what makes you think that was an appropriate thing to say in the context that you said it?\u201dThe Empress crosses her arms over her chest and gives Iulia a very level look. It\u2019s clear that she isn\u2019t pleased.", "1540493723000": "Again, The Empress chuckles to herself, discarding her mask of irritation. \u201cI didn\u2019t say you were wrong.\u201d\u201cThere wasn\u2019t a right answer to that question. I\u2019m not overly upset, nothing is going to happen to you, and yes, I\u2019m not terribly concerned with what the Taingaardians think of me. They\u2019re half a world away, and if they base their foreign policy entirely on aide\u2019s offhand comment, that\u2019s their mistake.\u201d She waves a hand dismissively.\u201cYou, however,\u201d she continues, using the same hand to gesture at Iulia. \u201cYou have far too much moxie for the position you\u2019re in.\u201dShe lets this comment hang, to see how Iulia responds.", "1540919350000": "\u201cNono, you misunderstand.\u201d Waving her hands, The Empress attempts to assuage Iulia. \u201cIf you\u2019d like to stay with the Diplomatic Corps, that\u2019s fine; I\u2019m not firing you, that\u2019s not what I meant.\u201d\u201cHowever, I wouldn\u2019t like you to represent Isra to the world.

Those clouds were barely visible in the distance, but she could see them, and they made her frown. Her gaze veered back toward Valerian when he introduced the undead squirrel, and a wide, thoroughly amused grin appeared on her lips as she laughed softly. \"Rupert, is it? How.. fitting. But I fear we have little time to waste, if those clouds are any indication. With me, if you would, please.\"Moving into the pavilion, she gestured for Valerian to accompany her, then inclined her head to Cyronin.\"General, this man is Admiral Valerian Kastimeer, and he is a necromancer.

I need to contact Lady Naoki.\" Bowing to both men, she turned a quick about-face, then gave Valerian a quick smile before exiting the pavilion.

Interesting. Not quite the sort of report I was expecting, but I\u2019m certainly willing to hear the man out when you return, if you think he would be worth listening to. I am curious what he considers himself an admiral of at present, but if he has the requisite skills and willingness to serve Isra well in that capacity, he can earn the title.

Just beyond, there seems to be a cliff, of who-knows-what height. It\u2019s difficult to say; mist obscures the ground, but they\u2019re apparently a good portion of the way up a mountain.

Her dress joins them there shortly after that \u2014 after being folded. Without further parading, Naoki proceeds to the water\u2019s edge, out of the immediate vicinity of any lilies. She spends a moment on testing the temperature with a toe, figuring it prudent to do so.Naoki is unsurprised to find that the water is hot \u2014 she supposes she could have guessed as much. Using an outcropping as a step, Naoki enters the water gracefully, causing only a small ripple. She continues in, down, until she\u2019s submerged up to her nose, reveling in the enveloping warmth.After a moment of adjusting, Naoki hears something. Her ears begin to angle this way and that, seeking the source of the noise. As she rotates, searching, her braid trails behind, floating lightly on the surface. She finds nothing. The acoustics in here are strange, especially so down in the water \u2014 one could have guessed that \u2014 but they\u2019re strange in a manner Naoki can\u2019t identify. She\u2019s unsure if this makes her uneasy, or if it\u2019s just another element of the novelty. It may be both.But there are more pressing curiosities to investigate. Naoki\u2019s ears fold backward to reduce drag as she cuts through the water toward the lilies, very much the prowling submersible. She stops about a foot away from the closest one and fixes it with a sharp look, expecting it to do something appropriately mystical. ", "1514847663000": "Enthralled, Naoki watches closely as the lilies do their thing and finds their performance highly satisfactory. Pretty, absolutely, and unlike anything she\u2019s seen before, which is perhaps more difficult. She finds herself curious to hear the explanation Jun mentioned but is savvy enough in this instance to know that it isn't the time. She resolves to ask about it later.As the humming picks up, Naoki\u2019s ears continue to swivel, restless, having not yet found the source of the noise. It's reflexive, just as one would (try to) look at the focus of their attention. Kate\u2019s humming, however, provides an excellent direction in which to listen. Though perhaps somewhat sappy for it, Naoki has always liked Kate\u2019s singing and thinks she's contributing much to the melody.Locating a suitably sized ledge, Naoki sits, still submerged from the neck down. She takes a deep breath and sits, able to relax for the first time in a significant while. To set the worries and the concerns and the responsibilities and the stress and the tension all aside, and sit, thoughts unburdened.Half-conscious of this, she does nothing. Nothing, save for keeping her head above the water, listening, and idly watching the goings-on, eyes half shut.", "1515613370000": "Watching Kate enter the water, Naoki is unsure what she\u2019s going to do. Splash Jun? Make a loud noise? No! Two jabs to the stomach \u2014 the one-two! Naoki is (half-)surprised by the roughness; she would have gone for something more subtle, or at least a bit gentler. When Kate surfaces behind her, Naoki startles, as if she wasn\u2019t watching the whole time. Looking back and forth between the two of them, the moment seems to stretch on for an eternity. Surely, Kate knows what she\u2019s just started? Naoki can only guess as to how Jun will retaliate but \u2014 wait. Realizing the genius in Kate\u2019s plan, Naoki plays along and holds her ground. \u201cWhat? Where?\u201d Pulling her arms up out of the water, Naoki aims wary looks down into the water as if concerned by the presence of \u2018Mermon.\u2019", "1515789579000": "Eyebrows raised, Naoki exhales sharply \u2014 amused, and lowers her arms back into the water. She expected Jun to see through the act and retaliate. She must be pretty tired, Naoki concludes. If she didn\u2019t sleep, it\u2019s unreasonable to expect her to last the day; Naoki doubts she will either.Though, she isn\u2019t quite comfortable enough to start dozing. Not here. What was said earlier about drowning, Naoki finds... unconvincing. There\u2019s a first for everything, and Naoki somehow doubts that this water \u2014 as mystical and pleasant as it may be, would be a very good thing to have in her lungs, regardless of whether or not it's technically possible to drown.Her desire to continue breathing is enough to keep Naoki\u2019s eyes open as she settles back down into her spot, smirking slightly. That \u2014 and eyeballing Kate. Two things Naoki doubts she\u2019ll get tired of anytime soon.", "1516150343000": "Naoki\u2019s eyebrows raise. She looks over her shoulder as if expecting to see a more qualified judge. \u201cVery welll,\u201d she says, becoming the stuffy mermon judge.Glancing around, Naoki looks for a suitable perch. She finds it on one of the spring\u2019s sides: a suitably smooth spot upon which she sits. Crossing one leg over the other, Naoki leans forward, peering down from on high.Deeming the vantage satisfactory, Naoki nods. She has a good view of the relevant area and, unless they move, she ought to be more or less out of the splash zone. \u201cReady\u2026\u201d", "1588887972000": "Empress Naoki enters The Arena on a fine summer afternoon, surrounded by Sentinels and a small procession of pages. She is far from the first one to do so, the dull roar of the crowd has been audible from The Citadel\u2019s stairs onward and grows only louder as she ascends. Below, the people of Isra continue to stream in under the watchful eye of The Guard, each depositing the requisite 5 copper fee as they pass through the gate. By the sound of it, the arena is perhaps half full, but The Empress knows it won\u2019t stay that way for long because today is race day.Arriving at her box, The Empress proceeds directly to the front, where she can for the first time see down into the arena. Placing her hands gingerly upon the railing, she looks out. \u2026 Her guess about the seating was good.The roar of the crowd falters, and there is a great deal of pointing and saluting as The Empress is noticed, followed by cheering. For this day of all days, The Empress wears neither red nor gold but a silken cloak of brilliant white, which, though not quite her color, symbolizes neutrality and does well to keep her cool under the blazing summer sun. The Empress raises her hand beatifically in greeting to the crowd and stands there for a moment more, looking this way and that as they cheer. As the noise begins to subside she returns to her box.Coming down the stairs, Naoki blinks a few times as her eyes readjust to the shade. Around her, the pages have finished their preparations, which essentially amount to the artful presentation of fresh fruit and preparation of large leaves to be used for fanning. They stand in an orderly line along the wall, and Sentinels have taken up their positions replacing the previous guards. All is in order... And Khepri is here. Excellent.\u201cIt seems the tailors have done well,\u201d Naoki remarks by way of greeting, unabashedly feasting her eyes. \u201c...Or perhaps it is merely you.\u201d A smirk.She gestures for Kehpri to come join her on the central divan, where a page is quick to provide a cushioned footrest. \u201cIs this to be your first race?\u201d she asks.", "1590034411000": "\u201cChariots!\u201d The Empress clarifies. \u201cChariot races.\u201d\u201cThe idea is such that you have the fanciful platform with wheels \u2014 you lash a horse or two or four to it. You stick a brave fellow on the back, give him a whip, and send him careening around the track. Races are usually seven, sometimes twelve laps for big ones like today.\u201d\u201cWhich would be all well and good. You could host races regularly, introduce betting, and have a merry little spectator sport for the people to watch. Great fun. A bit violent, what with the crashing and all, but otherwise wholesome fun for the whole family.\u201d\u201cBut then,\u201d Naoki brandishes a finger, \u201cBut then, you go and you factionalize it.\u201dStanding, she paces over to the railing. \u201cNote how the crowd is separated,\u201d she gestures, \u201cRed on one side, gold on the other. The Reds versus the Golds \u2014 a rivalry as old as something that\u2019s about one year old. The people have taken to it quite well, look at how many of them have shirts and pennants and such. They\u2019re very into it, I hear there was a bit of fighting last week, even. \u201d", "1464341009000": "The 27th of May; beautiful day to hold a tournament, a beautiful day to have off. As Madame Naoki makes her way down the road toward the Oculus Solis Arena, her hair moves in tandem with the angle sleeve of her new dress, fluttering softly in the breeze. She glances up to see a smattering of clouds drifting across the sky. How pleasant it is to have warm weather for a change, and be able to wear warm weather clothing, she muses. Flanked to the right by Artemis   and to the left by a senior Sun Marshal, Naoki casually locates the end of the queue to enter the arena, and takes her place in line behind an elderly man, hands folded behind her back. A few curious glances are aimed in her direction, and murmurs sweep the crowd as it collectively becomes aware of her presence. It is somewhat strange to see the leader of one\u2019s government standing in line with the general citizenry, afrer all. She counters the stares with pleasant smiles and friendly ear twitches, acting for all the world to simply be yet another citizen, here to watch the matches. One flanked by uniformed guards, perhaps, but still. She could have rode in on a litter made of solid gold, this is quite humble.Eventually, the stares mostly break off, though a few rolling whispers persist as informed citizens point her out to their uneducated companions. Having not participated in very many public presentations, this is the first opportunity many of them have had to look upon her. However, her pleasant smile remains, mind far from the situation at hand; almost daydreaming. But the line moves forward at a steady pace, a testament to the staff administering the event. Before long, it is Naoki\u2019s turn to deposit nine silver coins in the admissions box; three each, for her and her companions. As the passes through the primary entrance from the interior of the city, the guards flanking the grand gate snap to a simultaneous salute, and she nods politely in response. After passing through the gates, she meanders away from the primary flow of foot traffic into the seating area of the area, off to the immediate left of the hallway. One of a few such alcoves off to either side of the primary thoroughfare, a pair of stone doors blend subtly into the floral detailing of the curved wall. It is up against one of these doors that Naoki leans, bending one knee to place the bottom of one espadrille up against the door, and crossing her arms beneath her chest. In this position, she settles in to wait, here, at their agreed-upon rendezvous point. Her company should be along shortly enough, and until then, Naoki will wait, the corners of her lips still turned slightly upward. The Sun Marshal assumes a position directly in the center of the alcove\u2019s entrance, a steely gaze sending gawkers on their way and scanning the passing crowd for individuals of interest. ", "1464971828000": "Kate\u2019s explanation of her delayed arrival elicits a jokingly grumpy sort of pout and a \u201cHmmph\u201d from Naoki. Idly, she wonders just what sort of spices are more important than attending such a large public function, and in the personal company of her, no less. Thinking slightly further, she wonders why Kate bothers with the public business side of her business anymore. It isn\u2019t as if she needs the money, and if it\u2019s preventing her from doing things she\u2019d rather be doing, why even offer those sorts of services? She could just as easily \u2018close\u2019 her business and instead focus on the purely personal side of her talents, growing and maintaining her garden simply for the enjoyment of doing it. However, now isn\u2019t the time to start discussing that sort of thing. Naoki has been waiting weeks for this event, and she isn\u2019t about to sully the mood so soon with talk of business. Her pout gives way to the most pleased of smiles, and an affectionate arm finds its way around to rest on Kate\u2019s hip as she takes her place on the couch. With her other arm, she gestures to Alden and Takhana. \u201cKate, this is Alden, and Takhana. High Marshal and Administrator of the Sun Marshals, respectively. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ve had the pleasure of meeting them properly, but what I said about the previously remains the case, I hold the pair of them in high regard; they do excellent work. Alden, Takhana; Kate. I think I\u2019ve mentioned her once or twice.\u201d", "1465165401000": "Naoki nods. \u201cIt is. It\u2019s nice to be able to be comfortable outside without wearing six layers of insulation. If I could change one thing about Isra\u2019s climate, it would be to take the edge off the winter months. There are too many of them, they\u2019re too long, and altogether too cold\u2026\u201dAs they watch, the white-haired mammoth of a man advances on the mage, whose prospects look grim. Yet, at the last moment, an explosion of force erupts from the smaller individual, sending the Fletcher flying. A roar goes up from the crowd as they find out they\u2019ll have a real fight on their hands. As she watches, Naoki nods slightly, and casts a glance in Alden and Takhana\u2019s direction. She makes as if to study their reactions, but realizes what a futile endeavor that is midway through. Between the two of them, there isn\u2019t enough obvious emotion to fill a thimble. Instead, she turns to her left, tilting her head over slightly to speak to Kate. \u201cI should clarify. There\u2019s a secondary purpose to this tournament, beyond serving as an excellent inaugural event for this stadium, and generating revenue to put toward other ventures. It is our hope that the tournament has attracted some of the finest warriors in the world. And, by utilising the inherent sorting mechanism of the tournament itself, coupled with the appraising\u2026 eyes of these two, we might find some suitable candidates to join the ranks of the Sun Marshals.\u201dAnother blast of energy sends to the Fletcher flying once again, tumbling his way head over heels directly into one of the arena's walls.\u201cSuch is the hope, at least. I\u2019ve not been impressed yet, though I suppose I\u2019m not quite a qualified judge of these sorts of things.\u201d", "1465461967000": "Naoki nods thoughtfully. It is a rather pleasant event, she must agree. No blood is being spilled, the crowd is loud, but not disorderly, and anything that accomplishes multiple purposes so well is fine in her book. Especially so when one of the results is spending time with Kate, whose waggling elicits a grin from Naoki. She\u2019s correct, of course, on both counts. It is most definitely difficult, all of the interpersonal politicking and negotiating. Among the most stressful sorts of conversation, in Naoki\u2019s opinion- those conversations upon the fates of nations sometimes rest. And \u201cboredom\u201d is also definitely a factor at play. Artemis is of some assistance in both regards, but to have Kate along as well would be an unparalleled pleasure. And Naoki says as much, chuckling slightly as she does, \u201cIt is, and I do. We don\u2019t see each other enough as it is, without these embassies every few weeks, eating into what would otherwise be free time. It wouldn\u2019t be quite as bad as it is if I had someone competent to attend these sorts of functions in my place, but unfortunately, no suitable candidates have presented themselves yet, and someone has to go. With that said, though, I\u2019m pleased to hear that Vito is doing good work for you, and would like nothing more than to have your company.\u201dAssuming that the positions in which they are seated are allowing of such a movement, Naoki leans over and attempts plant a quick kiss, either on her partner\u2019s lips, the side, or the nape of Kate\u2019s neck, depending on the relative orientations of their heads. If not held in place for any longer, Naoki retreats after a half second or so, and after taking a moment to compose her thoughts, continues.\u201cAbout two weeks from now, we\u2019ll be sending a delegation over to The Land Tillers' State . I wasn\u2019t planning on accompanying them; it\u2019s not a major function by any means. Just some follow up diplomatic exchanges. I\u2019ve yet to personally visit The Expanse yet, but this trip would be an excellent excuse for us to, if you\u2019d like. I\u2019m not sure how much you\u2019ve heard, but their whole emphasis on agriculture and harmony with nature seems like it might be right up your alley. You could probably teach those Land Tillers a thing or two.\u201d\u201cAnd, either alternatively or additionally, there\u2019s a minor trip to Gauldin coming up. Some of our treaties need to be renewed in the coming month, and I need to go do that. I was only planning on taking a daytrip, spending a single night at most, but if you like, we could expand upon that trip. From what I\u2019ve seen, it\u2019s a beautiful country... if perhaps not the most politically progressive place I\u2019ve ever been. We could find a nice place to stay, sample some of the Gauldish cuisine, maybe tour the countryside some. Do whatever else it is that people do in Gauldin.\u201dThis statement is punctuated with a facetious shrug and a rather salacious wink, aimed to clarify not what, but rather who Naoki would be doing in Gauldin, should such a situation come to pass.", "1465895656000": "\u201cMhmm, you\u2019re quite right, we can\u2019t allow that. Perhaps some espionage would be in order.\u201dNaoki\u2019s tone, while seemingly quite serious and edged with malice, wouldn\u2019t likely fool any of the seating box\u2019s guests. Still, it is punctuated with the briefest of chuckles before Naoki continues, \u201cThough... The Tillers, they\u2019re not a bad bunch. I\u2019ve had the pleasure to make acquaintances of a few, and if my sample size is reasonably indicative of the whole, they\u2019re really a rather pleasant people. I doubt they\u2019ll require more coercion than a few polite words and a smile to share their secrets with the likes of you.\u201dAfter allowing Kate to conclude her caressing, Naoki sits back up and attempts to rest one of her arms around Kate's shoulders. For a moment, she simply sits. The intimacy of the moment is, in a way, simultaneously offset and enhanced by the roaring crowds around them and the swashbuckling clanking of weaponry on the sands below. It\u2019s difficult to be truly relaxed in a setting such as this, but the relative isolation of the seating box and the proximity of their bodies seem to enhance the\u2026 closeness, as it were. As far as Naoki is concerned, this whole affair is rather pleasant so far, if not quite her favorite date to date.\u201cAnd,\u201d Naoki continues, gaze flitting around the arena, \u201cthe other part  is, we don\u2019t even necessarily have to be in Gauldin to eat their food. What with those trade treaties I forged and the magnificent powers of oversea trade and logistics, we can enjoy such delicacies wherever we please. I\u2019ll make sure to have some assortment of Gauldish fare packed for our trip. \u2026 Speaking of such...\u201dNaoki turns her head halfway to the side to face Kate, but turns her gaze farther to look behind the couch to Artemis   before addressing her, \u201cArtemis, do you have anything good for eating back there?\u201dHowever, conveniently enough, Artemis' intervention isn't needed. On the table sitting just behind their couch, some thoughtful page has seen it fit to place a ceramic bowl of assorted fruit. Because, fruit, apparently. A few apples, a pair of bananas, a small stack of mangos, exactly four pears, and a bunch of grapes. Turning about in her seat, Naoki grabs the bowl in both hands, bringing it about carefully to sit on her lap as she reseats herself, either unaware, uncaring, or coyly not addressing any show she may happen to have given in the process of the movement.\u00a0\"Fruit?\" The offer is aimed mostly in Kate's direction, seeing as how Skarlet doesn't quite find such things nutritious.", "1466040893000": "Kate\u2019s exclamation startles Naoki, causing her to jump slightly in her seat and her tail to bush up. However, the following blush and apology is enough not only to sooth Naoki, but also to inspire an affectionate smile. Making an internal note of how incredibly attractive that just was, Naoki resolves to inspire more blushes from Kate in the future. Reaching into the bowl herself, Naoki selects one of the pears and spends only a moment  in examination before taking a bite. After all, if something was wrong with the food provided to her, someone would be in an awful lot of trouble, and her pages haven\u2019t given her any reason to doubt them yet. As it turns out, this particular pear is in the top percentile of juicy pears. As her teeth sink into it, a dribble of pear juice makes as if to dribble down Naoki\u2019s chin, but is no match for the speed of her tongue. With a dextrous movement and somewhat lewd licking noise, the pear juice is whisked away. \u201cThis reminds me. I knew a fairy, once; a few years before Artemis and I arrived in Isra. Little lime colored fellow, not unlike that purple one you found a while back. We called him Paul. \u2026 For reasons that ought not to be shared in polite company.\u201dTaking another bite of her pear, Naoki inclines her head slightly in Takhana\u2019s direction. Maintaining some semblance of polite conversation in her presence would probably be appreciated. After she finishes chewing, Naoki continues, \u201cAnyway, Paul had a particular penchant for pears. Every morning, just as the sun was rising, he would come in, carrying a ripe pear, the color almost matching his own. He would take the pear, and drop it on Artemis\u2019 head as she was asleep. He would continue to pick up, and drop it from ever increasing heights until Artemis woke up and diced the pear for him.\u201dChuckling slightly at her own mental image, Naoki smiles, still quite pleased with the state of affairs. ", "1466178057000": "Kate\u2019s request earns her a jokingly exasperated sort of sigh and a slight smirk. \u201cYou ate one mango and it was a very nice shade of orange.\u201dStill, with a little indignant sort of huff, that\u2019s a plausible enough excuse to send Naoki reaching for her bag. Any excuse to fund a bit more of Kate to grab is solid enough in her book. As she does so, Naoki considers the logistical issues involved in conducting a transaction through twenty feet of open, vertical air. The only stairs up to their seating box are in the rear, and are not at all accessible to the vendor. One would think that the man would simply be able to toss the cookies up, but the defensive measures in place around the seating box would put a swift stop to that with a bright flash of magic. Can\u2019t have displeased combatants or would-be-assassins loosing arrows up this direction, after all. With that in mind, Naoki beckons to the page boy standing just to the side of the stairs. Handing him a pouch clinking with coins, she performs a rapid series of hand signals to silently dictate her instructions.Nodding once in response, the page accepts the bag and scampers off down the stairs far more quickly than he really seems like he should be able to. Presently, he would find his way over to where Fran\u00e7ois is pushing his wares. Inclining his head up in the direction of the seating box and jingling his pouch, he attempts to nonverbally communicate that he\u2019s with them, and that he would like to purchase two bags of chocolate chip cookies on Kate\u2019s behalf using the money in the pouch.Additionally, Naoki rejoins Kate on the railing, sneaking in a glance in Kate\u2019s direction, (How gorgeous she looks when she smiles\u2026) before also turning her attention down to the pastry-man, to observe the proxy transaction to be carried out with the page boy. ", "1466185370000": "Somewhat confused, the page accepts the tray of cookies, and nods slowly. How many cookies must this man be carrying about, that he has so many varieties able to be sampled? It would seem to the page that it would probably be simpler and much easier to offer one or maybe two varieties of widely-liked cookies, and leave it at that. With all of these varieties, they can\u2019t all be priced the same. And if he allows people to mix and match, the bill would quickly become something of an arithmetic problem. Regardless, it isn\u2019t his place to judge such things. Following an affirmative nod from Naoki, he turns about and makes his way back up to the seating booth. As he arrives, Naoki holds up a halting hand, pausing before he can deliver them all the way to the sofa. If questioned, she murmurs to Kate, \u201cLet me check them.\u201dFrom her bag, Naoki produces her mug. That same, black, ceramic mug which she has used on so many occasions. Leaving the tray in the page\u2019s careful hands, and making sure they\u2019re well out of sight of the pastry-man, Naoki places the mug  on the tray, and carefully selects one of the cookies between her thumb and forefinger. Attempting not to mar the face of the cookie, she lowers it into the mug and releases it. Nothing happens. The cookie sits in the mug, and the mug makes no attempt to prevent it from doing so. Carefully, the cookie is removed, and another is placed in the mug. Again, nothing. From this, one may be able to (correctly) conclude that the mug has some manner of detection for unscrupulous\u2026 additions to food or drink. Poisons, contaminants, laxatives and the like. Presumably, if any had been present in the cookies, the mug would have reacted in some way. But it does not, giving the metaphorical green light on Cookie Sampling Time. Nodding to herself, Naoki takes the tray from the page- mug and all, and reseats herself on the sofa, resting the tray across her lap. The testing process took only a handful of moments, and aside from a few finger-marks, the cookies are untouched. And\u2026 if one is to be honest with themselves, rather appetizing. In the spirit of courtesy, Naoki does not select a cookie for herself, offering Kate first dibs, as it were.", "1466257732000": "Observing Kate\u2019s antics, Naoki isn\u2019t quite sure what to think. Kate\u2019s break in composure wasn\u2019t quite expected\u2026 But is is it warranted? Are the cookies truly as good as all that?...There\u2019s only one way to find out, she supposes. Sliding one off the edge of the tray with thumb and forefinger, Naoki raises the pastry first not to her lips, but her eye, taking a moment to examine it. For all the world, it simply seems like a cookie. A pretty reasonable looking cookie\u2026 Some bits of chocolate are visible, and some manner of white dusting has been applied to the top, perhaps powdered sugar\u2026 but nothing so obviously far departed from her general understanding of cookies causes this one to stand out to such an extreme degree. It must be in the taste, then. (As she supposes it ought to be.)Lowering the cookie, Naoki inserts one edge into her mouth, almost cautiously. She bites, and chews, a thoughtful sort of look on her face. Nodding slowly, is is forced to admit, this is a damn fine cookie. Though she doesn\u2019t show her enthusiasm in such an unladylike way, the remainder of the cookie is swiftly consumed and an appreciative sort of \u201cMmMmmm\u2026\u201d follows. Reaching for another, Naoki\u2019s other hand waves in the direction of the page, dispatching him once more. He takes off once again down the stairs with that same outrageous speed, the lollypop having found its way into his mouth at some point. However, in the handful of moments it takes him to make his way down to where Fran\u00e7ois is standing, the lollipop and all evidence of its presence have disappeared. Once again, he presents the pouch of coins, and attempts to perform the transaction. ", "1466331907000": "Unfortunately enough, the page is deaf. Though he sees Fran\u00e7ois\u2019 lips move, clearly directing some manner of inquiry in his direction, he cannot hear it. Instead, he extends the index finger of his right hand, touches it to his ear, and drags a line across his face down to the corner of his lips. In some forms of nonverbal communication, this signal is equivalent to the phrase \u201cI\u2019m deaf.\u201d But whether or not Fran\u00e7ois is acquainted enough to decipher this is up to him. However, judging by the Isran badge affixed to the page\u2019s otherwise plain black tunic, one may be able to surmise that he is a government worker in some capacity. Assuming that the transaction goes smoothly and the proper number of coins may be transferred, the page nods to the man in thanks before abruptly turning on his heel to disappear off in the direction he came, bag of cookies clutched in one hand.For her part, Naoki watches the exchange from above, having polished off the remainder of the samples with Kate. When the page returns to the seating box, Naoki is waiting for him by the door, accepting the bag with a grateful nod. Opening the bag and one of the pouches at random, the first of the second batch of cookies goes not to Kate, nor Naoki, or anyone else seated in the booth for that matter, but rather the page boy who was kind enough to do the legwork, as Naoki hands him two of the cookies from the open bag, still warm from whatever manner of heating apparatus Fran\u00e7ois is using. A deep bow and a wide smile speak to his gratitude and also serve to excuse him, as the page takes his prize off to go snack on somewhere else. Nodding slightly to herself, Naoki turns back about and proceeds back to the sofa. The scent- or rather, scents are intoxicating. Reminiscent of Maelik\u2019s own cooking, in the way the smell of it seems to leverage itself not only into one\u2019s nose, but the very forefront of one\u2019s consciousness, dominating one\u2019s attention in a way that a smell really not ought to be able to.Still, Naoki manages to make her way back over to Kate, and only when she is there to properly witness the event does Naoki pull wide the lips of the bag, displaying the treasure within for her perusal. ", "1515265419000": "A pair of Imperial Sentinels precedes The Empress into her viewing box, stepping off to stand on either side of the door. Perched high, the box has a commanding view of the arena. It\u2019s a somewhat large affair suitable for The Empress\u2019 use, featuring several finely upholstered seats, a few benches, silk tapestries for shade, and a complement of attendants bearing fruit and cold beverages. \u201cAh. Grandma.\u201d Lady Naoki isn\u2019t surprised to find her here. Over the past few days and in speaking generally, Naoki has mentioned to several individuals that she would be pleased to have their company up in the box, but it seems like Grandma is the only one to have arrived so far. Though far from the most... personable company she might hope for, Naoki is glad to have her here; anyone human will be at least partially distracted by the spectacle and as thus won\u2019t be paying their full attention to things such as her security.Moving past where Grandma is seated, Naoki strolls her way down to the front of the box, into the spotlight of the sun. Placing her hands on the railing, she looks beatifically out across the arena, visually surveying the crowd. For this event, Lady Naoki has chosen to wear a red dress which she thinks may be flattering from a distance perhaps more so than some of its peers.", "1515555141000": "\u201cMmmh.\u201d Naoki murmurs her acknowledgment. Down below, the match is starting. Leaning forward onto the railing, she peers down and sees their mouths moving. \u201cI would like to see... their limits tested,\u201d Lady Naoki says after some deliberation. Though the superficial purpose of the match is that of entertainment, it accomplishes much more. For the fighters, it\u2019s excellent practice that would be difficult to obtain any other way. For the magi of The Enclave, it will be something to study, analyze, and learn from. For the city, it\u2019s a sporting event that pleases the people, and the revenue generated from filling the arena\u2019s seats is not insignificant. But more than any of that, this match will be a statement of The Empire\u2019s strength. A flex of her metaphorical muscles. All who have ears to hear today\u2019s tale will know this: these are the powers Isra commands. To the everyman, to the citizen, it is an inspiring spectacle, showcasing the incredible talents of the living legends who stand in stalwart defense of everything they know. Not a soul in Isra fears for invading armies or rampaging monsters, for the beasts foolish enough to try have been struck down! To see these heroes in action is a grand performance, in which all Israns may take pride. To the enemy \u2014 to foreign upstarts, to the warlords, the bandits, and the criminal degenerates, it is an implicit threat. As easily as spells are slung in the arena, fiery death could rain down upon them. This display of magical power implies much about The Empire's capabilities \u2014 in that they are significant, and far outstrip that of any would-be-foe. Naoki knows not the names of her every enemy, but she does not need to. They will hear of this, and they will think twice.But to her \u2014 to The Empress herself, this event will be an interesting test of sorts. One of the downsides of leading an unchallenged superpower is that opportunities to make use of its military might are limited. Very rarely do threats arise that justify the use of any real force, and the majority of what opportunities do emerge are more akin to sweeping than swordplay, Naoki thinks. No tests of skill. On only a few occasions has Naoki witnessed Jun in action, and Daedalus not at all. To truly know what each is capable of, they must face a challenge, and that is what Naoki hopes they will find here \u2014 in each other. She would like to see just how strong, how clever, how capable they are. And this is a pretty damn good way to do it, she thinks. Horatio signals for the match to start. Naoki looks from him back down to the field, squinting slightly. \u201cThough, of course,\u201d she continues speaking to Grandma somewhat distractedly. \u201cYes. I would like to see Jun win; she would enjoy that. \u2026 It would be strange for me not to! I\u2019ve hardly talked with our Mysterious Minister \u2014 we\u2019ve both been busy, I suppose...\u201d", "1515970603000": "Glancing to the side for a moment, Naoki gives Grandma a look. A look that says, \u201cI\u2019m watching this. Why are you bringing up something unrelated right now, of all times? I\u2019ll listen out of respect, but honestly.\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d she says aloud, turning back to the duel. An uncharacteristically curt response.", "1517365901000": "Hearing two someones entering her box, Lady Naoki turns to see Robert, with some girl on his arm. Naoki isn\u2019t sure if she\u2019s surprised or not, but regardless, she greets the pair of them cordially.\u201cRobert. It\u2019s good to see you.\u201d  Accepting the box, Lady Naoki lifts the lid slightly to peek at the contents. The same sorts she purchases from Renalt. Excellent. She wonders what he\u2019s after.  \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Dixie,\u201d Lady Naoki continues, with her best beatific smile and nod. \u201cIt certainly looks nice from up here, doesn\u2019t it.\u201dTurning, she gestures out over the rail. Below them, the entirety of the arena is sprawled below for their viewing pleasure. \u201cHave you  been to The Citadel?\u201d Naoki asks. ", "1517425087000": "Looking up from the match, The Empress gives Dixie a look, then glances back down. Below, lightning bolts crackle through a large mass of water and are accompanied by floating runes, light constructs, and all manner of flashy magics. The sound is dampened, but still somewhat loud. And Dixie would like to know if there\u2019s anything special about them? Naoki shakes her head mentally but doesn\u2019t mind spelling it out. \u201cThe man\u2019s name is Daedalus. He\u2019s The Minister of Magic\u2014high position in my government. She\u2019s called \u2018Jun of The Celadine;\u201d she\u2019s a Land Tiller, a Sun Marshal, and a hero several times over. Both of them are, as you can see, terribly powerful mages.\u201dLady Naoki gestures and tries her best not to come off as demeaning. \u201cThis is the first exhibition match of this sort. Though, it seems attendance is good; I believe organizing more will be a good idea.\u201d The box of chocolates finds a spot in the shade, where they hopefully won't melt.\u00a0", "1517626282000": "Lady Naoki goes to speak, prepared to launch into a lengthy explanation of magic, the arena\u2019s protections, and the art of delegation, but Dixie catches her off guard, and she stops.An \u201cinspiration?\u201d Naoki has been called many things, but this is a new one. In her consideration, Naoki pauses. Glances at Robert. Then it clicks. \u201cYou aspire to this?\u201d The question seems genuine. Naoki circles one finger in the air, referring to the box and the decadence surrounding them as symbols of status, power, and wealth. Common aspirations.To Lady Naoki, it seems obvious. Here stands a kindred spirit, walking a path she has already traveled.", "1518417712000": "Lady Naoki nods. She suspected as much, but Dixie was kind enough to spell it out.\u201cWell,\u201d she says \u201c you\u2019re doing rather well for yourself in that regard.\u201d\u00a0\u201cIn fact,\u201d Lady Naoki continues, \u201cI think you\u2019ve done just about as well as you possibly could have.\u201d Turning her head, Naoki aims to catch and hold Dixie's gaze as she goes in, taking casual half-steps in her direction. She comes directly adjacent, maintaining a steady eye on her prey. \u201cBecause you\u2019ve come alllll the way up here to this box, and caught the eye of The Empress herself.\u201dFor three beats there is relative silence. Then she uses her tail to give Dixie a swift slap on the ass. Though it doesn\u2019t crack like a whip, the idea is the same. After allowing a moment, Lady Naoki leans an inch closer and asks in the same conversational tone, \u201cJust how closely do you intend to follow my example?\u201d", "1518493725000": "Lady Naoki smirks, the tip of her tongue between her lips. That\u2019s what she\u2019s about. The gasp, and that expression of utter surprise, followed by realization. Though Dixie doesn\u2019t blush quite as much as Naoki would have hoped, she's young enough to be much fun regardless.\u201cIn that case, I propose the following. After the match, and after the after-match activities, join me at The Citadel. There, you will learn much, and in doing so, accelerate your career.\u201d", "1518674416000": "The Empress also turns to glance at Robert, over there with his friend. Naoki has been able to somewhat follow his dicussion on account of her ears, and finds the situation mildly amusing. Hopefully, he hasn\u2019t heard a word of what was said over here. After a moment of thoughtful consideration, Lady Naoki snaps her fingers to get his attention. \u201cOi.\u201d \u201cRobert.\u201d She makes a beckoning motion; she\u2019d like to speak with him.The Empress then speaks to Dixie out of the corner of her mouth, \u201cSay nothing.\u201d", "1518675247000": "\u201cMhm, yes, quite so.\u201d She brushes off his comment to get to her own. \u201cI would like to know if it would be alright with you for me to borrow Dixie.\u201dShe seems entirely serious in asking. As if she were his neighbor asking to borrow a tool.", "1518677510000": "Naoki is disappointed, and she huffs lightly, swapping her straight face for slightly furrowed eyebrows. She had hoped he would ask \u201cfor what\u201d or something similar, in which case she had an entire little thing mentally planned out which would have been amusing and led him into to coming along without her directly propositioning him. That\u2019s the real problem with being undisputed ruler of the world, Naoki supposes. It denies her the opportunity to do clever little things like that. Now she\u2019ll have to figure something else out; he\u2019s too savvy for his own good.Then she figures it out, and The Empress fixes Robert with a shrewd look. A look that isn\u2019t necessarily conveying any particular meaning, but she\u2019s not finished with him yet. She holds him like this for the space of a few silent seconds.\u00a0\u201cThree guesses as to what I will be doing tonight!\u201d she says suddenly, raising three fingers.A pause, and then, \u201cIf you guess correctly\u2026 you can come.\u201d", "1518870834000": "The Empress\u2019s expression is flat, and she is silent for a long moment. He\u2019s being sassy. \u201cVery well,\u201d she begrudges, \u201cthough that was more than three guesses. I expect you to be on your best behavior.\u201dAfter flashing Robert a (teasingly) severe look, Naoki turns her attention back to the arena. Below, the match continues, and the fighters seem very evenly matched. Evenly matched, insofar as they\u2019ve been at it for a few minutes and neither has yielded. With her evening successfully booked, The Empress now intends to watch the remainder of the match.", "1481621422000": "\u201cHmm. Interesting. \u2026 Alright, so noted. I\u2019ll trust you to monitor the situation and take further action if you think it necessary.\u201dThen Lady Naoki\u2019s carriage arrives at the Northern Gate, slowing to a halt a short way past the portcullis- which is shut. Stan: Carriage Attendant First Class and Animal Handler Extraordinaire hops down from his seat at the front of the carriage, and begins to putter about the horses, petting them or whatever else it is he does.Jax: Carriage Attendant First Class & Master of Observation is in his usual place, with his torso protruding from the top of the carriage, spyglass in his hand. Though he can\u2019t quite see the being that he was told of due to how there\u2019s the large stone structure of the gate in the way, that doesn\u2019t stop him from trying. Naoki herself, for her part, simply opens the rear door of the carriage and seats herself on the ledge. When Takhana had contacted her, Naoki had been wearing an off-white sweater with gray trousers, as he often tends to, and hasn\u2019t changed since then. Here, she intends to wait for Emahra to arrive. Which shouldn\u2019t be long, she figures. ", "1481824620000": "Naoki finds herself rather surprised as the creature abruptly lands before her. Hadn\u2019t quite been expecting that. Still, there have been more surprising events she\u2019s witnessed, and she maintains composure, only tensing slightly. In response to Emahra, Naoki nods once, very deeply, \u201cMmmmmmhm. That\u2019s one way to put it. Look, it\u2019s got scales on its underside...\u201d She gestures in the general direction of the creature with one hand, where the scales are immediately visible while Haru rolls.Then, she slides down off the edge of the carriage to stand on the ground next to Emahra. Figuring the creature is cat-like enough to interpret cat body language, she makes a point of extending one ear straight upward, the other upward at a bit of an angle, and holding her tail more or less parallel to the ground, intending to express friendly interest.\u201cHello,\u201d she offers, unsure if the creature is of an intelligence enough to understand speech, or even speak itself.", "1482270797000": "Rather surprised to see the being nod back at her, Naoki offers no complaints as the being closes the gap and begins to rub itself on her, only raising her arms up awkwardly to either side as not to have it rub on her hands as well. \u201cOh,\u201d she remarks, rather placidly, as it proceeds around to the other side, getting hair all over her outfit. Slowly, tentatively, Naoki lowers one hand to place it atop the creature\u2019s head, behind one of its ears. From there, she proceeds to begin to rub its head and the fur on it. \u201cYou know what sort of being this is?...\u201d Naoki asks Emahra, turning to make eye contact and giving the other woman a very serious sort of look as she continues to pet the creature.\u201cA soft kitty,\u201d Naoki states, as if this is the only possible answer, and an exceedingly obvious one, at that.", "1482955182000": "Smirking a bit to herself, Naoki seems rather pleased that this feline sort of fellow appreciates her ministrations. Most do, to be fair, but even so. However, as he pulls away and proceeds with his own scratching, Naoki quirks an eyebrow upward. Her first thought is that that\u2019s not going to come out of those cobblestones. They\u2019re going to need to be replaced, or at least turned over.Her second thought, Naoki articulates, \u201cWell\u2026 I\u2019m personally more inclined to think that it\u2019s a personal name, but it would seem like the best way to find out would be to ask.\u201dTurning a bit to address him, Naoki is very direct in asking, \u201cIs that what you would like to be called, \u2018Haru\u2019?\u201dAs an afterthought, she adds, \u201cAnd is that how it\u2019s meant to be pronounced?\u201dIt is at this moment that Naoki realizes the relative absurdity of the situation at hand. Here she is, stopped in the middle of the street with her whole carriage, Emahra, Emahra\u2019s horse, and a being the likes of which hasn\u2019t been seen in the known world as far as she\u2019s aware. Some citizens have stopped to watch, perhaps because it\u2019s mildly interesting to observe the head of one\u2019s government liaising with a strange being in the street just outside one\u2019s house. Or perhaps because the carriage is blocking the majority of the traffic that would usually be flowing through the northern gate. In any case, Naoki silently resolves to attempt to move this business somewhere else shortly, even if it is just off to one side of the road. ", "1485899616000": "\u201cHmmh,\u201d Naoki remarks. She holds one hand in the other behind her back as she attempts to form a conclusion. Haru here is sapient, with the ability to understand and write the common language. Simultaneously, he\u2019s a soft kitty. Naoki finds this to be perhaps harder to reconcile than she, of all people, really should.But beyond that, Haru is evidently capable of flight, and of jumping over the gate, here. His claws must be terribly sharp to be able to scratch into solid stones like that, too. In any case, the intended goal of her presence here is to obtain a creature that would make a good mount. While Naoki wouldn\u2019t quite call Haru a 'creature' at this point - seeing as how he has a sense of self and seems literate - she doesn\u2019t see any particular reason to abandon her goal. With that in mind, she decides that introductions are in order. \u201cWell, it\u2019s good to meet you, Haru. I am High Lady Naoki of Isra, and this is Isra.\u201d She gestures around, intending to make it clear she refers to the city. Figuring that it would be the proper course of action, Naoki does not introduce Emahra, on the presumed notion that she\u2019ll do so herself. ", "1486077470000": "Listening to Emahra introduce herself, Naoki smiles slightly to herself, somewhat pleased. Another reason she chose not to introduce Emahra was to see which of the handful of possible manners of introducing herself Emahra thinks to be most relevant. In any case, Naoki finds Haru\u2019s continued scratching on the pavement to be rather interesting and apparently quite convenient. While not one to wholeheartedly subscribe to the concept of fate, this situation would seem to be shaping into a quite fortuitous coincidence. If it can really be called a coincidence Naoki supposes isn\u2019t quite clear, but regardless. She has her doubts about how well Haru would be able to utilize paper and pen with his paws there - they don\u2019t seem very suited to the task - but she\u2019s willing to give him the benefit of the doubt, happy enough just to go along with things for now.So Naoki nods, \u201cCertainly.\u201dA few moments thereafter, Jax: Carriage Attendant First Class & Master of Observation emerges from the rear of the carriage, carrying in his hands a stack of paper, two quills, and a bottle of ink. Approaching the group, he pauses, unsure if he should hand them to someone, set them on the ground, begin transcribing, or what. Regardless, he stands there, waiting for some further direction. ", "1486696464000": "As she looks on, observing the proceedings, Lady Naoki\u2019s mouth forms a small \u2018o\u2019 shape. Though she was not entirely cognizant of the surge of mana, the result is clear enough to see, and she rather likes what she sees. One could call into question Naoki\u2019s decency, and be fully justified in doing so, but she doesn\u2019t quite seem to care, being of the opinion that as the irrefutable most politically powerful figure in the known world, she has the ability - the right- to ogle whoever she damn well pleases, and never fails to take advantage of this self-declared right. She does not see it fit to avert her glance or offer in any way a means for Haru to cover himself, being more than satisfied with the situation in its current state. As such, Naoki has nothing further to offer at the moment besides a wide variety of overtly lecherous looks and a very smug sort of smirk.Jax, however, seems slightly off put. He has never been one to appreciate the company of beasts, and the current situation he finds difficult to categorize besides decidedly strange. That said, having been working as Naoki\u2019s carriage attendant for several years now, he\u2019s seen much stranger and isn\u2019t about to let a naked cat-man get in the way of fulfilling his instructions. As such, he places the writing supplies in Haru\u2019s hands without complaint. Afterward, he takes a large step backward to stand by the wheel of the carriage, where he folds his arms behind his back and struggles to find something to focus on besides the naked cat-man standing in front of him.", "1488913037000": "Silently accepting the piece of paper from Haru, it takes Naoki only a moment to read it and quirk an eyebrow upward. That\u2019s not a question she\u2019s ever been asked before. More often than not, it\u2019s her asking about the qualifications of a potential employee. Never have her capabilities been called into question, and certainly never by a naked cat-dragon-man sniffing at her shins. For a moment or so, Naoki considers the situation, and quickly reaches the conclusion that she would like this situation to stop happening here and start happening somewhere else. While Naoki doesn\u2019t necessarily have any categorical concerns to raise with liaising with naked cat-dragon-men, doing so here might be questionable. \u201cWell, that\u2019s\u2026 That\u2019s a highly subjective question and one that I can\u2019t properly answer without more context regarding the relevant criteria. Let\u2019s take this discussion elsewhere.\u201dWith her free hand, Naoki gestures toward the rear of the carriage, which still stands there, open. Evidently, she means to suggest that Haru enters.", "1489672202000": "Watching quietly, Naoki further quirks her eyebrow as Haru leaps up into the carriage, as he is. The carriage is a good three or four feet off the ground, and that didn\u2019t seem terribly difficult for him. He must possess some manner of flight magics or something to a similar end. In response to Emahra\u2019s question, Naoki turns to make eye contact and responds, \u201cYou know that I enjoy your presence, but if I\u2019ve pulled you away from something I\u2019m not going to ask that you remain, as I sincerely doubt your presence will be required for my safety at this point.\u201dFor a moment, Naoki pauses, and it almost seems as if she\u2019s finished, but then she adds, \u201cI am going to ask for a rematch, however.\u201dThis she says somewhat jokingly, though her intention is quite sober. While waiting for and to Emahra\u2019s response, Naoki moves to mount the ladder extending from the rear of the carriage, presumably with the intention to enter momentarily. ", "1489844645000": "After waving her farewell to Emahra, Naoki continues up the ladder, and into the great iron carriage. Selecting a seat opposite Haru, Naoki seats herself and gestures to one of the cupboards. \u201cThere are blankets in there. Help yourself.\u201dNext into the carriage is Jax. He eyes Haru slightly, out of security concern, but turns him back to pull the ladder up, close, and lock the door. After stowing the ladder appropriately off to the one side and eyeballing the both of them, Jax proceeds to the front of the carriage. There, he speaks with Stan, and shortly afterward, the carriage begins to move. <Exit to The Chalet>", "1445999304000": "Madame Naoki arrives at the Grand Bazaar, flanked on the left by Kate, on the right by Artemis. Her shawl is worn around her waist, hiding her tail, and her wide brimmed hat is worn low, at a decided angle. More than a mere fashion statement, it serves to cover her otherwise prominent ears.With her bandaged hand, Naoki awkwardly pushes the brim of her hat up, allowing her to clearly survey the marketplace. Amber eyes sweep back and forth across the chromatic stalls and canvas tents from which merchants peddle their wares. She had visited the Bazaar a few times before, but usually dispatched one of the staff to do her shopping. The marketplace was busier than the last time she visited it, perhaps because the city was growing, or, perhaps, today was just a busy day. \u201cThis would be it, then. Let\u2019s hold here for a moment.\u201dNaoki\u2019s right hand is, of course,  still wrapped in white medical bandaging, hurt from when she punched Hasdrubal\u2019s faceplate yesterday evening. The skin isn\u2019t visible through the multiple layers of clean canvas. Maladroitly, she uses her right hand to knock her hat backwards, off her head. It hangs over the small of her back, held up by the chin strap, wrapped around her neck.Carefully, she touches the mess of bandages against her ear, trying to signal using the earring.Nothing happens. She pokes it again, the un-opposable appendage clumsily bashing into the side of her head.Nothing happens. \u201cDammit.\u201dCursing Hasdrubal for the umpenteenth time, Naoki ceases her attempts, and her right hand returns to her side. \u201cHey, Artemis, could you contact Reese, and have him send somebody over here in, perhaps\u2026. two hours, to pick up our shopping? I wouldn\u2019t like to have to double back to drop things off.\u201dTurning back to Kate, she gestures ahead to the Bazaar in front of them. \u201cWhere would you like to start? I think we should probably pick up a couple of baskets first, to carry the rest of our things, and there\u2019s a particular book merchant I\u2019d like to visit, but beyond that, all I\u2019d like to do is make you happy.\u201d", "1446087699000": "Naoki holds her arm still for Kate\u2019s examination. \u201cI punched Hasdrubal in the face. Mashed up some of my knuckles. It\u2019ll be fine, I just can\u2019t use it for a few days. That\u2019s partially why I decided to take you out today, I can\u2019t do any writing, can\u2019t get anything done.\u201dAt Kate\u2019s suggestion, Naoki flashes a predatory grin. \u201cOoh, accessories. I adore accessories. Come on, careful not to trip!\u201dWith that, Naoki sets off into the colorful maelstrom of the Bazaar, pulling Kate by the hand. A few small stalls were examined, and dismissed as not possessing wares of a suitable caliber. After some time, their search comes to a halt in front of an ostentatious red tent. A tall, regular looking guard stands beside the front flap, above which, a sign proudly proclaims: \u201cBlingswald Family Jewels\u201d \u201cOooh. This is what we\u2019re looking for.\u201dNodding to the guard, Naoki leads Kate inside. The rich red fabric above them glows warmly in the light of ornate brass lamps. A series of counters and glass display cases wrap their way around three sides of the rectangular tent. Sitting on a small stool, the purveyor of the establishment, presumably one of the Blingswald family, hunches over something on the counter. Hearing the pair enter, he stands, and turns to greet them. A massively-built man with broad shoulders, he barely seems to fit inside the tent. A jeweler's lens sits on his face, and flowing locks of black hair roll around his shoulders. The man greets the pair with a short bow and an appraising gaze, then addresses them in a mellifluous tone, accompanying his speech with an expansive gesture. \u201cGreetings, ladies! Welcome to Blingswald Family Jewelers. I am Harold. We sell only the finest items, and if you cannot find what you\u2019re looking for here, we have the ability to produce anything your heart desires, made to order. What can I interest you in today?\u201dMadame Naoki nods her head in greeting, glancing around the tent, and nudges Kate, prompting her to speak to Harold. ", "1446261504000": "Madame Naoki avoids eye contact as she examines the wares around the tent, rapidly considering the possible impacts of her actions, and cursing herself for not considering them beforehand.Harold was a Midnight Sun regular; he could be counted on to drop by after work each day and blow through his day\u2019s wages on Silverleaf, sitting alone in his customary corner booth. He didn\u2019t socialise much, and never was involved in any of the rowdy groups. An excellent customer, by all counts. One with expensive taste and good habits.At Kate\u2019s request, the man nods, proffers some sales patter, and begins puttering about, trying to figure out what a viscaria might be.Madame Naoki stoops over one of the display cases, feigning close examination of the gems within. Meeting Harold here brought up an excellent question. How to publicly play her relationship with Kate. Naoki was known to enter into teasing flings on occasion, but was, by and large, considered very much a solo rider. The only one consistently seen at her side was Artemis, and that was easily excused. If she was seen on a regular basis with anyone, there would quickly be talk among the patrons and staff. Such talk could be detrimental. Stable relationships made \u201cnegotiations\u201d difficult; it was far easier to appear unattached.This was too complex a decision to make alone, so it would have to wait. For now, she would have to trust Kate to have a suitable level of discretion, and tip Harold to keep his mouth shut. Her mind made up, she truly looks at the gems in front of her for the first time, and is momentarily impressed with the sheer variety and extravagance, even within this single case. It was no wonder he could afford such fine vintages.Naoki shifts her gaze into the mirror lining the back of the case, meeting Kate\u2019s gaze. At the other woman\u2019s suggestion, Naoki nods. She was unsure what exactly made an orchid a \u2018cattleya\u2019, but something floral could be nice, sure. Looking again through the case, she begins to think about what she actually might be interested in. After a moment more of staring at a very different kind of silver in the mirror, she refines her thought process. What she might be interested in in terms of jewelry. After some browsing and comparison, a pinch of haggling, and a large sum of money changing hands, Naoki and Kate exit the jewelry store, each having found a few adornments to suit their tastes. They spend the next few hours among the other stalls in the bazaar. They pick out a few other accessories to tie together Kate\u2019s evening ensemble, and select a variety of sandwiches and other picnic-suitable delicacies to eat for lunch. They were unable to locate the book merchant that Naoki mentioned earlier. She mentioned something about coming back later.The pair eventually find themselves back where they began, on a side street just outside the bazaar proper, arms laden with their newly purchased goods. The sun gazes down from almost directly above them; Naoki estimates that they could expect Reese's messenger to appear before them at any moment. Naoki sets one of her baskets down on the cobblestones, and uses her arm to wipe a speck of sweat from her brow. \u201cThat was pretty fun. It\u2019s been awhile since I\u2019ve gone on a proper shopping spree. I\u2019m satisfied with what we picked up, as well. Those dresses will go perfectly with the jewelry.\u201d She flashes a roguish smile. \u201cI\u2019m also quite looking forward to my meal,\u201d she says, in a manner that decidedly does not call to mind images of sandwiches and pastries. ", "1446400364000": "Naoki chuckles; Kate\u2019s inexperience was evident. Lack of knowledge on that subject wouldn\u2019t likely last long, but Naoki found it terribly endearing while it lasted. Twisting her arm, Naoki works Kate\u2019s hand into her own. In an exaggerated motion, she raises her right arm ahead. The mass of bandages points forward at nothing in particular; the light of the sun glinting off the metal clip securing the dressings.\u201cOnward! To the picnic, for great sandwiches!\u201d<Exit to The Free Plains>", "1474200859000": "Following her departure from Forgemaster Epirus's office, Madame Naoki makes her way through The Dawnfire Forges complex to the squat brick buildings whose sign proclaims it as \u2018Featherstone Artificing\u2019. Spending a moment just outside, Naoki takes a moment to compose herself, collating her information on the establishment and its owner, preparing herself for the upcoming encounter. After a moment, still holding her bag in one hand, Naoki uses the other to push the door open and proceed inside, tail following her over the threshold before she pulls the door shut behind her. If the proprietor isn\u2019t present or immediately visible, Naoki would knock on some surface or another to announce her presence, and proceed to greet the woman if or when she arrives, \u201cMs. Featherstone, I presume. I\u2019ve heard a lot about your work, it\u2019s a pleasure to meet you.\u201dOffering her hand for a brisk shake, Naoki doesn\u2019t bother to introduce herself. If Liv is aware of who she is, fair enough. If not, it isn\u2019t as if her identity is terribly important anyway. After allowing a moment for the other woman to offer her own greetings, Naoki continues, \u201cI\u2019ve come to you today with what I think may be a fairly strange request, but one that I must preface with the following question. \u2026 Does the purview of your skills include golemancy, and if so, to what extent?\u201dAwaiting an answer, Naoki stands, one arm holding the other by the wrist behind her back. Her tail swishes from side to side idly, but is careful not to get caught in any of the potentially tail-crunching apparatus scattered about the shop.", "1474226824000": "Nodding in acknowledgement, Naoki offers a noncommittal shrug as she responds, \u201cYes and no. The issue I have is a unique and complex one and not one that can be so easily solved by ordering an item- even from one such as yourself. No, what I am looking for is knowledge. I would like to learn from you, and myself become proficient in basic artifice, and more importantly, golemancy.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve already done what I can with literature; I\u2019ve read everything available to me, and am fairly confident in my understanding of the theory. Yet I lack any practical knowledge or experience. As such, I would like to request- if you would comfortable providing such a service, lessons. Or classes. Or however else you might like to structure it such that you impart upon me practical knowledge in the field of golemancy; I\u2019m not picky.\u201d With her request simply stated, Naoki stands quietly, hoping she didn\u2019t come off as too overbearing.", "1474347054000": "As Livilla voices her assent, Naoki offers the other woman a token smile, and responds, \u201cExcellent.\u201dPlacing her bag on the floor for a moment, Naoki extracts her notepad and a quill. She stands in place for a moment, scribbling away, before displaying her writing. Listed is a figure- a sum, which is to be paid hourly. It is a fairly substantial sum, but not a grossly generous one. To arrive at this figure, Naoki roughly estimated how much Livilla might make in profit for an hour\u2019s worth of work, and doubled it- which ought to about cover any errors on her part, Naoki thinks. \u201cI would propose- bearing in mind that both of our schedules are less than regular, that we meet here at your shop as circumstances allow on a roughly weekly basis, and that I pay you this sum for each hour of instruction. Is that acceptable, or would you prefer another method of payment\u2026?\u201d With this last statement, Naoki raises one eyebrow in what would seem to be an almost lecherous inquiry. ", "1474537312000": "Nodding her acknowledgement to Livillia\u2019s assent, as well as in her own agreement to Naoki responds, \u201cVery well; I will not. I had no intentions to anyway- I seek this knowledge for my own private use only.\u201dFor a moment, she considers asking Livilla to drop the \u2018your ladyship\u2019 bit, but decides against it, at least for the time being. They\u2019ve only been chatting for a few minutes, after all. Instead, she begins to explore the realm of scheduling, \u201cHow does tomorrow, starting at noon sound?\u201d Looking about, Naoki attempts to locate some manner of signage that might state which hours Featherstone Artificing is open. ", "1474766038000": "Once again nodding in response, Naoki adjusts her hair with one hand as she offers a follow-up question, \u201cExcellent. Would you mind if I brought lunch, or do you eat before then?\u201d", "1474925282000": "Acknowledging with another nod, Naoki extends her hand for shaking and responds, \u201cIn that case, I\u2019ll see you tomorrow- with sandwiches. Until then.\u201d After allowing Livilla to either shake her offered hand or decline to and offer her own farewells, Naoki offers the other woman a warm smile- intending to articulate her thanks preemptively, before turning to leave. ", "1580439968000": "Some time later...Heavy bootsteps echo down the tunnel as Empress Naoki descends into The Square\u2019s holding zone. Snowflakes still hang on the floof of her ears and she hasn\u2019t bothered to take off her gloves; she isn\u2019t staying long. Walking before her is the on-duty Captain, sweating under the heat of the eyes on the back of his head. He had hoped to follow her down the stairs, but she insisted that she lead him to the correct cell -- she isn\u2019t familiar with the prison, after all.He dutifully leads the way down the hallway, past several empty cells. This section of The Square sees few prisoners and is somewhat presentable as a result.\u201cHere they are, your Highness.\u201d The Captain gestures to the cell where the is being held. It\u2019s the only occupied cell in the block, so he\u2019s fairly confident it\u2019s the correct prisoner.The Empress waves him out of the way and approaches the bars. One hand in the other behind her back, she looks down on the prisoner. Her eyes flick between their face, ears, tail, then fixate on the anklet and linger there for a moment. The Empress says nothing, and frowns. \u201cBring the anklet up to the bars,\u201d she says, gesturing. \u201cLet me see it.\u201d", "1580446621000": "Empress Naoki considers making a quip about the gold coin, but there is a matter of greater import at hand. Bending at the knees, she looks closely at the anklet, inspecting it. Reaching out with one gloved hand, she gingerly tests its thickness between two fingers and rotates it around. Craning her neck ever so slightly, she sees printed on the inside that which she did not wish to see.Withdrawing her hand, The Empress slowly stands, looking for the first time at the person wearing the anklet. She isn\u2019t entirely sure how she feels about this development, and so maintains a fiercely neutral expression. \u201cHow much do you remember?\u201d she asks, with no further context than that.", "1580803898000": "As she listens to the prisoner\u2019s tale, The Empress is entirely still, down to the tip of her tail. Much of what the prisoner says, while interesting, is irrelevant. Her question is essentially a binary one, to confirm what seems more and more likely with each passing second. At the sight of the scars, one of Naoki\u2019s feet slides backward, as if to run, but she catches it and maintains composure. After the prisoner is finished, The Empress is silent for a long moment, her face unreadable.Naoki then abruptly turns her attention to the pouch on her hip, in which she begins to rummage. \u201cWarden! Open this door! Release my sister.\u201dThe warden does a double take but rushes to comply. \u201c...Y-yes, your Highness.\u201dAs the warden is fumbling with his keyring, Naoki finds what she\u2019s looking for and extends her gloved hand through the bars to offer it to Andrea. It is a small gemstone, smaller than one\u2019s smallest fingernail, of a muddy reddish-pink sort of color. Amethyst, or perhaps garnet, polished into a marble.\u201cIt is a curative. Swallow it whole and sit back down.\u201dCrafted long ago by Naoki\u2019s best artificer, the magic imbued in the gemstone is far more powerful than its size might imply. Once inside an individual -- by whatever means, the curative magics trigger violently, repairing tissue, expunging infection, eradicating disease, and potentially even regrowing lost digits. They were intended for use in situations where one may have sustained an otherwise-fatal blow, and the healing magic is entirely indiscriminate. Naoki was told that it is not necessarily an altogether pleasant experience to be healed in such a manner, but it doesn\u2019t take long and is obviously preferable to the alternative. Fortunately, in the years since, Naoki has never had cause to use one, so she doesn\u2019t know what it might be like. Part of the reason she offers it to Andrea now is simply to see it work, and the other part is that she isn\u2019t inclined to NPC call for a healer.Because it seems like there\u2019s an awful lot wrong here. Not only with Andrea herself, not only with her health, but the ramifications of this new development are many and complex. This is a time of much stress for Naoki, and finding out that one of her \u2018sisters\u2019 survived is not helping matters. Frankly, Naoki would just like to go home and curl up with something warm for a nap, but it doesn\u2019t seem as though that\u2019s in the cards for today. At least she can fix these health problems Andrea has -- at least she can do that.", "1581305559000": "Naoki waits for the noises to stop before peeking her head back around the corner. The smell is telling, but curiosity compels her to look....She isn\u2019t glad that she did. Seeing the result of what transpired in the cell, Naoki ducks back around the wall with a hand covering her mouth.The warden, for his part, stands transfixed in terror. Despite the circumstances, he cannot help but utter a high-order explosive of disgust. The Empress will not begrudge his conduct, as he took the words from her mouth. \u201cI will see you... Later,\u201d Naoki calls around the corner. \u201cAt the citadel! \u2026 Once you\u2019re clean. We will speak then.\u201dA significant look at the warden implies that he is to be responsible for this, but in actuality, The Empress will send over some of her own people. One of them will be an Enclave magi who knows a cleansing cantrip (ideally a strong one). Afterward, they will have orders to transport her to The Citadel to meet with The Empress. There isn\u2019t necessarily any \u201ccatching up\u201d to do per se, but the discussion that\u2019s to be had that can wait until then.", "1467831160000": "Kate\u2019s words stir Naoki form her half-conscious state of serenity. As she continues, a small sort of mischievous smirk slides its way onto Naoki\u2019s face. Two can play at the coy game. \u201cI maaaay have mentioned something\u2026\u201dShe trails off, clearly teasing. For a moment, she simply sits there, showing no inclination of confirming, denying, or moving in any way. That expectant look. The way Kate\u2019s trying to play it off, to mask it. Endlessly appealing. But the look on her face upon receiving the item ought to be even better, Naoki figures. So she rises, raising her tail to find balance on the unsteady carriage floor. With a few swift steps, she moves around the table to cross to the other side of the cabin, and approach the kitchenette. Bending at the knees, she moves to undo the simple lock and open the cabinet. \u201cI actually have a small handful of items for you, on this marvelous occasion marking the anniversary of your birth. However, some of them are somewhat situational. So, allow me to give you this now, but expect more over the next couple days. And as opportunities present themselves.\u201dThough her smirk isn\u2019t visible from behind, the tail-waggle certainly is, alluding to just what sorts of situations the other gifts may be suitable for. After waiting a moment longer to allow Kate\u2019s mind to wander, Naoki extracts the item from the cabinet, straightens, and crosses back over, now carrying a small box. Roughly the size of one\u2019s hand, fingers outstretched, the box is a fine piece of workmanship in and of itself. Hewn of some manner of reddish wood, there isn\u2019t anything eye catching about it, per say. It is simply a very well made box, with fine-grained wood, polished faces, and the initials, \u2018K. G.\u2019 embossed into the top and inlaid with gold leaf. Moving back to her original position to Kate\u2019s right, Naoki turns half-sideways, extending both arms to offer the box, and its contents, along with a slight sort of almost anxious smile. The object within is a piece of jewelry. A bracelet; a bangle, even, or an anklet, if one would prefer. Forged of Sunmetal, it shines with the soft glow of sunlight itself, and is warm to the touch in the same manner that rays of the sun are warm as they dance across one\u2019s arm. An intricate pattern of two inlaid golden vines snake their way around the circumference of the band, twining around each other and sprouting flowers of inlaid gemstones where they touch- three blooms, equidistant from each other.The first flower is- while not perhaps any sort of technically accurate, real flower, a circular sort of thing, with many small, radial petals. Presently, it\u2019s a soft dusky orange hue gently tinged with a shade of creamy ivory. The second flower, proceeding clockwise, is a rather pleasant sort of orchid-looking thing, apparently cut of some manner of deep purple amethyst. Lastly, the final flower on the  band is apparently a rendition of a tiger lily, complete with the little speckles interspersed throughout the otherwise-transparent flower as imperfections. After waiting for the box to be opened and its contexts examined, Naoki continues, \u201cThis is, in addition to being a beautiful piece of jewelry, a powerful magical apparatus. The first masterwork of Dawnfire Forges, primarily credited to Forgemaster Epirus, it was only finished this morning.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s made out of Sunmetal. It uses the sun\u2019s rays to maintain a whole host of enhancements, major and minor. Across the whole band, a few utilities are in place to prevent it from getting dirty, damaged, stolen, or any of that. This flower,\u201d she gestures with an extended finger, \u201cthis is quartz. It would usually be white, but color of it changes with the time of day, due to the enchantment. Right now it\u2019s a pleasant sort of yellow for mid-morning, but as the day goes on, keep an eye on it. It should transition into a brighter yellow as noon passes, darken down to orange for the afternoon, fading into purple and then midnight black for the dead of night. And, if you press on it, it emits light. Useful in the dark, I would think.\u201d\u201cThis flower,\u201d Naoki continues, indicating the orchid, \u201cis much like the gemstone in your ribbon, but with a few extras. It\u2019s linked directly to my earring. As long as it\u2019s purple, I am well, and you can press on it to contact me, wherever we might happen to be in the world relative to each other. Likewise, as long as the band is close to you- and you\u2019re well, I will know. Mutual peace of mind, I figure.\u201d\u201cAnd, this flower here,\u201d She points to the tiger lily, \u201c this contains all of the defensive magics. Very, very powerful stuff in here, you should be aware. The majority of it is autonomous. If someone in your vicinity harbors ill-intent toward you, it will cause the entire band to go cold. If you are assaulted, it will defend you with wards and other such\u2026 defensive magics. I\u2019m not quite clear on the details. You can press on it to manually engage what I\u2019m told is a full-body shield, which ought to protect you from all manners of attack. Additionally, if any of this flower\u2019s functions are engaged, my security people will be alerted, and you can expect Sun Marshals to be on the scene as quickly as they possibly can be.\u201dLeaning back, Naoki awaits Kate\u2019s reaction with bated breath, arms extended, palms on knees. ", "1468687661000": "Naoki's eyebrows furrow a bit at the drawn likeness between the bracelet and herself. Is Kate saying she\u2019s round? Is that a roundness comment?Regardless, as Kate continues to examine and don the gift, Naoki discards the thought and breaks into an almost humorously wide smile. Firstly and foremost, she likes it. She is pleased. So pleased that she\u2019s kiss- oh my-Naoki\u2019s thoughts, and any that may have come after that one are cut off there as she is forced down onto her side with a small sort of \u201coonf\u201d sound. For the space of a half-second, Naoki finds herself thankful for splurging on the bench-cushions. If she had not, she would be sporting an excellent concussion right about now. But no. Opening her eyes, she turns her head slightly to see where Kate ended up, and is pleasantly surprised to find her face only a few inches from her own. Which makes it that much easier to whisper, \u201cFitting.\u201d Which, while not perhaps the most romantic or witty thing to say, was the first thing that came to mind.Naoki opens her mouth as if to continue, most probably to offer some supplementary, but ultimately somewhat unnecessary secondary clause, but is again cut off as Kate\u2019s fingers find their way up to her ears. Her very sensitive ears, as opposed to any others- and all that comes from Naoki\u2019s mouth is a strangled sort of moan. Though the bottom arm moves to provide support; to prevent Naoki from rolling right off the bench and onto the floor, the other comes to rest somewhat limply on Kate\u2019s lower back. It would seem as if advanced motor control, along with speech conjugation and coherent trains of thought have all been temporarily suspended due to ear scritch. Under the caress, Naoki squirms slightly, pressing the top of her head back up into the scritching hand, but otherwise offers no comment or resistance. ", "1468895365000": "A disappointed sort of pout makes itself present on Naoki\u2019s face as Kate withdraws. That was excellent; why did she stop? Naoki moves as if to sit herself up but stops abruptly midway through the motion at the issued command, more out of surprise than anything else. It\u2019s been a long while since she\u2019s been issued a command. Still, she supposes, nothing too terrible could come of it, especially considering that Naoki is aware of the contents of Artemis\u2019 gift box. So she stays.The next command, however, elicits a raised eyebrow and a slight squint. Borrow her midriff? What manner of\u2026 Naoki considers it for a moment. Perhaps it\u2019s a polite way to refer to her chest. Fair enough. Presuming that the previous command has been invalidated by the most recent one, Naoki sits up and spends a moment to remove her top- the same one she had arrived to Green\u2019s Greens with earlier that day. She struggles for a moment with the neck, attempting to remove the garment without totally disheveling her hair, but is highly unsuccessful with that secondary goal. In the process of pulling it up over her head, any semblance of a reasonable hairstyle is ruined, leaving locks of hair tumbling every which way, covering her face. Frustrated with the garment, Naoki tosses it away to the opposite side of the cabin, nodding slightly to herself as it crumples against one of the kitchenette cabinets. Then, she turns to face Kate, and brushes the hair from her eyes.Upon properly noticing the item held in Kate\u2019s hand, Naoki\u2019s complexion manages- perhaps by some miracle, to lighten several shades, and her pupils dilate to complete the alarmed look. Of all of the items in that box Kate could have chosen to select. The harness. The clips. Any of the whips, or the other assorted implements. Of them all, Kate had chosen the feather. Instinctively, Naoki makes an uncharacteristic move to cover herself, crossing her arms across her chest and becoming acutely aware of how chilly it seems to be in the carriage without one\u2019s top.Perhaps it was a lucky guess. Perhaps it was a coincidence. Or perhaps Kate and Artemis had shared a few words, either previously or just now in the selection of the item. Regardless of how the situation came to be, Naoki finds herself as a deer in the metaphorical headlights of that seemingly innocuous feather. Time seems to pass in slow motion; Kate\u2019s talk of \u2018letters\u2019 and \u2018rules\u2019 fall on deaf ears. Hearing, but not comprehending. The next thing Naoki becomes aware of is the sensation of being on her back again. Which is strange. Considering she didn\u2019t consciously make an effort to lie down. She attempts to sit up, raising a hand in protest. \u201cNo, wait~!\u201dAnd then it began. Naoki doesn\u2019t last even a second under the stated rules of the \u2018game\u2019, immediately breaking down under the touch of the feather and squirming about every which way. Someone is giggling wildly. Is it her? Perhaps. She\u2019s too busy giggling wildly to put any serious thought into the matter. Her limbs flail madly, attempting to push, pull, or cover herself, but they can\u2019t quite decide which, so they end up simply flailing about without any real force behind them. Occasionally, the giggling is interspersed with half-conjugated words and phrases, such as \u201cNo, plehehehease,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m ticklish,\u201d \u201cNohohoho, please,\u201d \u201cArtemis, help me,\u201d \u201cYou fiend,\u201d \u201cDammit,\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ll pay for this,\u201d  \u201cStahahahapit,\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t breheheathe,\u201d and other assorted moans and expletives of both pleasure and frustration.", "1469258720000": "\u201cTry using a harness next time,\u201d comes the soft response.As things relax further, Kate settles down on her chest, and her breathing begins to slow, Naoki stares up toward the ceiling of the carriage, and allows her mind to wander. Not in any particular direction, not headed toward any manner of conclusive decision or resolution. Just wandering, wondering, thinking about Her. How it feels as Naoki idly runs her fingers through Her hair. The manner in which She giggled just there, and how pleasant it would be to sit- or rather, lie, just like this, all day. Forever, even. The trail of kisses does an excellent job of snapping Naoki back into the here and now, however, She inhales sharply, surprised as the first makes contact, and is fully prepared and then some by the time their lips meet. A hand placed on the small of Kate\u2019s back holds her in place until Naoki has had her fill (at least for the moment) as not to be denied for the third time in a row. At the murmured question, Naoki pauses to consider, adopting a very serious sort of look as she reviews the inventory of the trunk as she remembers it, and considers each item for immediate use. After a moment, however, she shakes her head, indicating the negative. A few Many tempting possibilities exist, but not yet. Not even having begun, Naoki feels no need to spice things up, as it were. The ride to The Expanse is going to take all day, anyway. There would be plenty of time for that. With that predatory sort of smirk that she does, Naoki extends her arms to grip Kate\u2019s thighs and rises, intending to carry her a few feet to the adjoining bedroom, small as it may be. Silently, with the aid of her earring, Naoki reaches out to their driver, Stan: Carriage Attendant First Class and Animal Handler Extraordinaire, instructing him to slow, easing the carriage's rocking, and pushing their time of arrival back an hour or so preemptively. ", "1471770827000": "On a bright and sunny but otherwise more or less ordinary Tuesday afternoon, Madame Naoki arrives at 13 Riverside Drive. On this afternoon of afternoons, she has- despite the warm weather, chosen to wear one of her sweaterdresses, along with some high boots and stockings. Additionally, it should be noted, on this afternoon of afternoons, Naoki is not, as she always has been, accompanied by Artemis. Instead, a pair of particularly burly and quite stout gentlemen follow in her wake, dressed very well in a pair of matching turtleneck sweaters.  Between the pair of them, they hold a large wooden trunk. The trunk itself, though it seems to be relatively well made- and quite heavy, judging by how it is held, isn\u2019t the most ornate thing ever- dark wood with silver edging. However, the geometric patterns carved into the wood are certainly something. Which is to say, the patterns are surprisingly complex, for what one would assume to be a purely aesthetic feature. As she approaches the front door, Naoki\u2019s strut comes to a gradual stop. For a moment, she simply stands before the door, smiling wistfully at the door-knocker and the white gemstone embedded within. Knowing that no one is staring back. Only a moment is spent in the past, however. In a single smooth motion, Naoki raises and drops the doorknocker, announcing her arrival to the occupants of 13 Riverside Drive. ", "1471853303000": "It takes a moment and a half for Naoki to recognize that someone is in the door, as she was looking directly ahead, expecting someone taller. When she does, however, an uncharacteristically genuine smile spreads its way across her face.\u201cI,\u201d Naoki begins, placing a hand on her chest and adopting her most regal tone, \u201cam your godfather,  High Lady Naoki of Isra. It is a pleasure to meet you, miss.\u201dWith this, Naoki offers Moon Moon her most extravagant curtsy, massively over-exaggerating in a motion that she intends to be interpreted as humorous. Unsure of how aware Little Moon Moon might be of what exactly that all might means, and how well versed she may be in answering-the-door-etiquette, Naoki decides to elaborate, \u201cI\u2019m a friend of your father\u2019s, and I\u2019m here to visit. May I come in?\u201d Tilting one ear toward the door and noting the state of Moon Moon\u2019s dress, Naoki begins to postulate: Something is being baked.", "1471954865000": "Her own smile widening as she steps over the threshold, Naoki holds one hand in the other behind her back as she follows the girl down the hall. There\u2019s something endearing about the children that Naoki doesn\u2019t seem to mind acknowledging as such. Behind her, the two sharply dressed gentleman follow, still carrying that chest between them. Following some unspoken or previously issued instruction, they only proceed inward only far enough to find somewhere mostly reasonable to deposit their cargo before quietly departing, be that place what it may. Perhaps an alcove in the hallway, in a side-room, or simply in the entry hall itself, if the entry-hall is large enough to accommodate such a thing without obstructing traffic. They close the door behind themselves and make their way back off into the city as, leaving Naoki safely within the confines of the building and the chest with her.Meeting Alden in the hallway, Naoki responds to his bow with a nod of her own and waves a dismissive hand as he mentions the mess before replying, \u201cLikewise. Uncharacteristically enough, today I come for purely a social visit; to check in, and see how you\u2019re faring.\u201dWith one hand while maintaining eye contact, she gestures to the walls to either side and to the house at large, intending to refer not quite to the situation immediately at hand, but rather the larger status of Alden, his marriage, and the care of his children, having been given and accepting responsibility as named godfather of the children and knowing that Alden isn\u2019t exactly the largest socialite and that his circle of personal friends is decidedly small. Not having visited since before the children could talk (even if that was only a few months ago) and having a clear schedule for the day, she thought that dropping by would be a good idea.Moving a step closer, leaning forward slightly,  and lowering her voice, Naoki continues, \u201cI\u2019ve also brought some pee-ar-e-ess-e-en-tee-ess.\u201d ", "1472104693000": "Holding her arms up, Naoki is rather surprised by the onslaught of children, and particularly the little audacious one starting to scale her leg. Unfortunately, Naoki\u2019s stocking isn\u2019t quite rated to support that level of tomfoolery, and tears easily, revealing a goodly portion of Naoki\u2019s bare leg. If Naoki gives half a damn about the stockings, she doesn\u2019t let on, instead waving another dismissive hand in Alden\u2019s direction.As she kneels, careful not to squish any tails on the way down, Naoki\u2019s earring glimmers slightly as she reaches out to Alden silently and telepathically, \u201cAlden, they\u2019re children, and young ones at that. If I minded dealing with children, I wouldn\u2019t have come to your house. Stop apologizing. By overusing it, you\u2019re diminishing its value. Wait until they break something important, or actually do something to warrant an apology.\u201dSimultaneously, Naoki addresses the veritable mob of cat-children crowding around her verbally, now that she's on their level. Figuring that she\u2019s already been introduced by little Moon Moon, Naoki opts to start with a greeting and go from there. \u201cHello, everyone. It\u2019s good to meet you all,\u201d Naoki says, figuring, of course, that looking at the children when they were essentially little cat-eared potatoes doesn\u2019t quite count as \u2018meeting\u2019 them, and this would really be the first memory they would retain of her.\u201cI have indeed brought presents, but only for well behaved and clever children. I wonder if there are any of those here\u2026?\u201dInterestingly enough, Naoki doesn\u2019t raise the pitch of her voice or use any unnatural sort of inflection when addressing the children, as some might. Indeed, she addresses them with the same sort of friendly, polite tone she might use when speaking to any adult- a friend, in a casual setting. ", "1472183208000": "Watching the antics of the children, Naoki\u2019s smile remains firmly in place. A motley little crew, they are. Silently, she again wonders how Little \u201cRawr Raw\u201d is going to handle his name later in life. While it may be cute as all get-out now, it\u2019s not exactly a very\u2026 respectable name, Naoki thinks. He\u2019ll probably end up adopting a nickname. Looking down on Little Naoki from the height that is 175cm, a slight sort of smirk taints The Larger\u2019s smile. An audacious little thing, she is. Wonder where she got that from. However, Lady Naoki chooses not to address it, leaving it up to the others to address her and clarify themselves as they see fit. She has enough titles and aliases. Little Naoki would find the chest to be locked. Rather well locked, at that, by two locks on the front side of the chest. In these locks, two silver keyholes are presently, presumably for two keys. Almost as if on cue, the pouch on Lady Naoki\u2019s hip jungles metallically with some movement. The hinges of the chest are not visible. Again addressing the children, Naoki continues, \u201cWell, before presents, you lot should probably finish your baking. Or at least get it into the oven. The batter will go bad if you leave it out too long.\u201d Naoki inclines her head in the direction from which the group came, knowing fully well that if she orchestrates this properly, and the cake turns out to be edible, she\u2019ll likely end up  being offered a piece. ", "1472287272000": "Folding her hands again behind her back, Naoki follows Alden and his children into the kitchen, and does her best not to seem visibly surprised. Granted- she had expected a mess. That much was a given. But how did they get it onto the ceiling? Children certainly are something, Naoki muses. Quietly, she feels grateful for Skarlet being as relatively mature for her age as she is. Dealing with the sorts of problems she has, Naoki thinks, is probably easier than scraping cake batter off the ceiling. Careful not to stand beneath the batter, Naoki moves off to one side of the room where she ought not to get in anyone\u2019s way and stands by unobtrusively, watching the conclusion of the cake preparation. Afterwards, she looks on as Alden orders the children to go get cleaned up. He seems to be doing well enough with the whole parenting, she supposes. But she\u2019s hardly the best judge of that, and she knows it. That, and what about all of the time he spends at work? His duties as High Marshal are vital and time-consuming. Ms. Higgs is probably an excellent caregiver- Alden wouldn\u2019t employ anything less, but still...Lost in such contemplation, Naoki is caught somewhat off guard by Alden\u2019s inquiry, and stumbles on the response, \u201cUhm. \u2026 A glass of water, please.\u201d", "1472314133000": "Taking the mug, Naoki casts a look in Alden\u2019s direction, indeed attempting to assess him to some extent. She isn\u2019t particularly successful, though. The relative lack of body language on his part is- beyond being somewhat off-putting, very good at masking whatever it is he\u2019s thinking. Perhaps intentional. In response to his inquiry, Naoki begins to speak, \u201cI\u2019m\u2026 alright. \u2026 A bit tired. \u2026 A bit stressed; I\u2019m beginning to be faced with an ever-mounting stack of difficult questions to answer and problems to solve without any real solutions, both personally and professionally. Those sorts of things are never any fun\u2026\u201dShe trails off, taking a sip from the provided mug. After a moment, she decides to continue, \u201cHonestly, in a way, I preferred the old problems. Poverty, and trying to make a living for myself and those close to me, as opposed to trying to wrangle the international economy to my ends. Going on dates as opposed to hosting summits. Organizing waiters and waitresses, as opposed to hierarchies of command. Writing up employment contracts as opposed to drafting international constitutions of human rights.\u201dPausing for a moment, to take a another sip from the mug, she realizes that she probably shouldn\u2019t have mentioned that last bit. But whatever. Alden isn\u2019t at the loose-lipped sort anyway. Naoki continues, \u201cBut otherwise, I\u2019m doing fairly well. I mean, there\u2019s certainly a lot of fulfillment in doing my job correctly- I can\u2019t deny that, and I have a lot of power to improve lives, so I really can\u2019t complain about much.\u201d She shrugs, almost apologetically.In an effort to continue the conversation, she poses a question of her own, \u201cHow about\u2026\" Again, she gestures to the room around them, again intending to refer to the house and the situation in the general se.se \"things here? Anything much more to report beyond the obvious? They\u2019re growing very quickly.\u201d", "1472335471000": "Reciprocating eye contact, Naoki quietly notes Alden\u2019s gesture with a solemn sort of nod. He does indeed share the burden. The weight of lives on his shoulders, and all that. She doesn\u2019t seem to register any surprise at his sudden apparent depth of emotion, but to be fair, she\u2019s not too bad at concealing such things herself. As he continues, she continues to nod. In this case, it\u2019s Naoki who can empathise to a degree. Seeing Kate in the gaps in her schedule is difficult and inconvenient for them both. It works, but isn\u2019t ideal by any means. Idly, Naoki wonders why Alden hasn\u2019t requested any extended periods of time off to spend with her, but opts not to question the matter. He\u2019s fully aware that he has that ability, and has chosen not to take it for a reason.But then the children return. Mildly surprised to see them back so soon and not having fully planned how exactly she intends to determine what exactly constitutes a \u201cwell behaved and clever child\u201d, Naoki finds herself somewhat grateful as the opening door precludes her response. Tilting one ear to listen, Naoki hears a voice that she hasn\u2019t heard in... a fair while. Predicting the children\u2019s movement, Naoki steps quickly to one side, hopefully moving her out of the way of the impending stampede. However, assuming that Alden and the children do proceed back into the entry hall, Naoki would move along behind them quietly- as not to be left in the kitchen by herself. Seeing Moonflower, Naoki would nod once in greeting, respectfully, but remain toward the back, as not to intrude. ", "1472396616000": "\u201cIt has indeed, Ms. Moonflower. Congratulations to you, too.\u201dLeaving it simply at that, Naoki quietly pads after Moon into the sitting room, figuring that with the cake in the oven and the children more or less clean, it would be about time for the distribution of presents. Seating herself on one side of a loveseat just to the side of the chest she brought, Naoki places her drink on an adjacent table, careful to use a coaster.With a small sort of smirk, Naoki directs the majority of her attention toward the children, watching to see how they proceed. In her right hand, resting upon the armrest, something small and metallic may be visible through her fingers for those who might choose to look- a key. ", "1472526536000": "Holding the key up  between two fingers for observation, Naoki Prime responds, \u201cIt is,  yes.\u201dThe key itself isn\u2019t anything particularly special. Smooth, silver. About as long as Naoki\u2019s longest finger. Lots of little teeth on one end, and an O-ring on the other, presumably for hanging it on a hook or a ring or something of that sort. A similar sort of geometric pattern as that on the box is engraved down the shaft of the key- presumably for identifying what the key is used for when among other keys. \u201cAnd,\u201d Naoki continues, drawing the key back out of the reach of small hands, \u201cI will give it to you, if you can answer this riddle. ... What has six legs, two arms, armor, sharp claws, and an operational range of seventy five miles?\u201dHaving delivered her riddle, Naoki eyes the children with her on the sofa with a gently teasing sort of look, genuinely unsure of if they might be able to answer it easily. They\u2019re pretty damn clever rascals, definitely, but they might lack the requisite world knowledge. ", "1472533127000": "At each offered solution, Naoki shakes her head to indicate the negative, grin widening each time. After it seems as if the children have offered as many solutions as they have for the moment, Naoki continues, \u201cI\u2019ll give you a hint- just one for free. More will cost you.\u201d Her last statement is accompanied by a mischievous sort of smirk before Naoki proceeds to the hint itself, \u201cIt\u2019s something that can be seen here in Isra very regularly, traveling in groups. But not by the lazy, and not by vampires.\u201d", "1472616195000": "As Little Naoki offers the answer, Lady Naoki nods in confirmation, pleased to see her namesake seems to be a fair ways ahead of her kin in the wit department. \u201cQuite right. A mounted Dawn Rider. Isra\u2019s first response, flying cavalry.\u201dExtending one hand, Naoki offers the silver key on her palm for Little Naoki to take, she having correctly answered the riddle. She would find, if she tried, that the key fits in the left, but not the right keyhole, and would not turn. Presumably, a second key would be required before either would turn or the chest would open.\u201cNow,\u201d Naoki continues, addressing the children at large with a lightly teasing smirk, \u201cwhere do you think the other key might be?\u201d", "1472796590000": "As her namesake returns and crawls up into her lap, Naoki watches quietly, offering no solution. However, as the little hands begin to explore her body, searching for a pocket that doesn\u2019t exist, Lady Naoki begins to giggle- in a very unladylike and obviously uncontrolled manner. Whether this laughter is born of amusement, joy, or pure ticklishness is hard to say. Regardless, Little Naoki would find that Lady Naoki\u2019s sweaterdress has no pockets, the neck of it coming up far enough to preclude even an improvised pocket. However, Lady Naoki is quick to put a stop to her shenanigans, grasping Little Naoki under the armpits and hoisting her up in the air, holding her just high enough so that her feet dangle just above Naoki\u2019s thighs. Holding her there for a moment, Naoki eyes the child with only the lightest touch of sternness layered atop her otherwise quite pleased expression. \u201cNow, you. It\u2019s not in my pocket, and it\u2019s impolite to grope people without first acquiring their consent. You should strive to be more ladylike.\u201dThis, of course, coming from Naoki of all people, who could debatably be labeled as a Professional Groper and who had only moments ago been giggling uncontrollably as if she were the toddler.With that, Naoki sets the child down in her lap again, and places her right hand atop her head to keep her still for a moment. Finding her fingers in a prime position to do so, Naoki The Larger begins to scratch at the back of Little Naoki\u2019s ears in the manner in which she herself finds it most pleasing to be scratched.\u201cThe key,\u201d Naoki begins, reaching out her left hand over toward the nearest twin (either Kae or Caleb, she can\u2019t quite tell), \u201cIs in here,\u201d she finishes, pointing to one of their ears. Without offering any further explanation, she begins to scratch at that ear. Moments later, a second silver key drops, not from the scratched ear, but rather Naoki\u2019s hand, but that would be somewhat difficult to see due to the sleight of hand involved, especially for he who is being scratched. However, in reality, it was literally up Naoki's sleeve. The key lands on the sofa to Naoki\u2019s left, to the right of the twin and directly before Naoki The Smaller. The second key is more or less identical to the first, save for the fact that its patterns are considerably varied, enough so to tell them apart easily enough. It would fit in the second lock, and once inserted, both keys would be able to be turned, and chest lid would open. The chest lid, one would find, has two braces that extend as the chest is being opened and slot into grooves to prevent the lid from closing until they are both disengaged. Additionally, some manner of precaution- perhaps in the construction of the hinges, has been taken to ensure that the lid is incapable of closing too quickly or too forcefully, and thus, ought not to pose a danger to any little fingers. And even beyond that, within the chest, a small disengage lever for the locks is present, to prevent anyone getting trapped inside. However, as for the actual contents of the chest, the first items one would see would be six little boxes. Small,  square, wooden boxes that seem quite similar to the chest in their construction and style, each being detailed with a similar, but not identical geometric print and hewn of the same wood. On the top of each box, a name has been printed in relief to identify the owner. Six children, six names, six boxes. Each box opens without a key, and inside, one would find a small collection of items. Along the left side, in a specially designated compartment of the box, quills. Four quills, of varying types. One white and plush, one bright and vibrantly blue, another red tinged with yellow around the edges, and the last simply brown. Next to that, two square bottles filled with ink sit corked, one filled with black ink and the other with a deep blue. Next to those, a small, bluish sort of leather bound book only large enough to fit in one\u2019s hand. The cover of each book is printed similarly, with \u2018[Child Name]\u2019s Address Book\u2019. Within the book, a number of pre-lined pages sit prepared to accept addresses. Above the address book, another, similarly constructed but larger crimson tome rests. They are titled, \u2018[Child Name]\u2019s Journal\u2019. As one might expect, the interior of each journal is empty. Beneath all of this, resting in the bottom of each box, a sizeable stack of blank parchment sits adjacent to an equal number of envelopes. Lastly, to fill out the small bit of remaining space in the box, a small wrapped chocolate has been included. Once the boxes of writing supplies are removed, the contents of the chest beneath them would become visible. That is to say, the books. The remainder of the chest, laid three layers thick, is filled with books. A rough estimate would see two hundred or so tomes in there, neatly stacked and all matching, apparently from the same publisher. The color of their covers range from blue to red, through purple. On the spine of the majority of the books, in addition to the title, a single letter is printed. It isn\u2019t immediately apparent what the letters mean. They may not be in order. Taking one out to examine it, one would find that the title of each book is handwritten in curvy script on the cover, along with the name of the author, and the words \u2018Copied by Madame Naoki\u2019. Within each book, one would find, as one might expect, the patterns of ink that literate individuals so often interpret as words and thoughts. Interestingly enough, however, it would seem as if, (as stated) Naoki herself has done the physical writing of each book in lieu of contracting a scribe. The composition of the books is an interesting one, depending on how one might interpret it. It would seem to be a mixture of introductory books to certain core concepts, high level works in complex fields that ought to be far beyond the understanding of their intended audience, works of fiction, and books that seem only to be there as a means to teach the children skills they might utilise (harmlessly enough) to Alden\u2019s irritation. A small, random sampling of their titles is as follows.

Quietly, she muses that a year ago, she wouldn\u2019t have given half a damn about some random children. But yet, today, here she is, having spent hours upon hours copying books for them and finding herself so pleased to see these children- which aren\u2019t even hers, so happy. It\u2019d seem like Naoki has changed along with Alden. Catching Alden\u2019s gesture, she waves a dismissive hand and responds telepathically, \"It\u2019s my pleasure.\"\u00a0Leaving the children to peruse their gifts, Naoki remains seated on the loveseat, looking on quietly. Noticing that Miss Moonflower, Juney, and Rawr Rawr are all drifting off, she remains silent. However, judging by the look on her face and how she seems to be attempting to catch Little Naoki\u2019s eye,  it\u2019d seem like Naoki has more to say to the children. ", "1472886616000": "Watching the children set into their gifts, Naoki\u2019s smile remains in place, she not bothering to hide it. Reflecting, she supposes that in a very roundabout sort of way, this is the sort of thing that she intended to do by climbing the metaphorical ladder as much as she has, and gathering such power. Using it to bring joy to others- small children included, is quite gratifying. As Alden pokes Miss Moonflower awake and leaves the room with her, Naoki makes little of it, understanding the need to speak without fourteen pointed ears listening in. Her attention is mostly on the children, anyway.As Little Naoki notices that Lady Naoki is watching her and immediately scampers over, Lady Naoki is somewhat surprised. She had expected the little one to be more fully engrossed in the book, and more unwilling to set it down. Perhaps she had just earned some points with the young one, Naoki muses. Looking down at the child in her lap, Naoki\u2019s inquiry is simply stated. Or rather, whispered, \u201cWell? What do you think?\u201d", "1472920722000": "In an attempt to calm her counterpart and prevent her from waking her siblings, Naoki takes one hand up to place it atop her head. From there, she lifts it up slightly, brings it back down gently, and repeats. Pats. Kitties love pats. Or. Well. Big Naoki likes pats, at least. It would remain to be seen if Little Naoki likes pats.Still speaking quietly, she responds, \u201cI\u2019m glad you like it. You\u2019ll learn a lot, reading all of those books. \u2026 But what happens when you run out, once you\u2019ve read them all?\u201dPausing for a moment, Naoki gives her counterpart a moment to contemplate that awful scenario before posing her next question, \u201cDo you know how to write letters?\u201d", "1472952420000": "Listening to the child\u2019s answer regarding the books, Naoki nods thoughtfully in response. A fine enough answer, that. However, as the girl continues, Naoki shakes her head, but does not pause in her ear-scratching. \u201cNot those kinds of letters. I mean letters of the sort that you write to someone and send to them. The ones you put in envelopes and give to a messenger to deliver, and the ones that messengers put in your mailbox. Your box has everything you\u2019ll need to write one; why don\u2019t you get it, and I\u2019ll teach you how.\u201dMotioning to Little Naoki\u2019s box over near the chest, Lady Naoki pauses the scratching for a moment, and gives the girl a gentle pat on the back to suggest that she get up and bring it over.", "1473027129000": "Accepting the items from Little Naoki, Naoki places the parchment onto the board and then the board onto Little Naoki\u2019s lap. Likewise, she dips the quill in ink, and hands that to her smaller counterpart, before draping her left arm over Little Naoki\u2019s shoulder and beginning her lesson. \u201cA letter is a note that you send to someone else that you can\u2019t speak with easily because you\u2019re too far away. Just as an example, let\u2019s write a letter to me, thanking me for the gifts. When beginning a personal letter, one almost always begins with \u2018Dear\u2019, and then the person\u2019s name. So start up here- near the top, and write\u2026\u201dDear Lady Naoki, \u201cThen, after leaving a little bit of space here, you can start writing whatever you want for the person to read. So go ahead and write something like\u2026\u201dThank you very much for the gifts you gave us. I am looking forward to reading all of the books. \u201cFrom there, you can continue and write whatever else you might like to write.\u201d Pausing in her explanation for the moment, Naoki waits for her counterpart to catch up and finish writing whatever else it may be that she would wish to write. After it seems like she\u2019s finished, Naoki continues, \u201cAnd then when you\u2019re done, leave a little bit more space, and sign it. Depending on who you\u2019re writing to, you could say, \u2018Sincerely\u2019 and then your signature, or \u2018With Love\u2019 and then your signature, or \u2018With gratitude\u2019 and then your signature. There are some other options, too, but those three should be fine for now. Which closing you choose is up to you and should match the context of your letter. For example, if you are writing a formal letter as opposed to a personal one, you might want to pick a more formal closing, like \u2018Kindest regards\u2019.\u201d\u201cAnyway, once you\u2019re done writing, you should wait for the ink to dry, maybe blow on it some, and then fold the letter up like this\u2026\u201d Naoki reaches a hand over and demonstrates how to fold the letter properly, but leaves Little Naoki to do the actual folding. \u201cAnd then put it in the envelope. Then, if you want the letter to go to the person you want it to, you have to write their name on the front of the envelope, in the center, along with where the person might be found. In this case, since you\u2019re writing to me, you would write \u2018Lady Naoki, The Citadel, Isra\u2019.\u201d\u201cThen, once you\u2019re done and the envelope is sealed, you take it and put it in your mailbox. Every day, a messenger comes to take all of the letters you want to send, and deliver any letters addressed to you. So once you put this in the mailbox, he\u2019ll come, take the letter, and deliver it to my office, where I can open it, read it, and then send you a letter in response, and then he\u2019ll put it in your mailbox.\"", "1473056137000": "Exercising patience and respect over curiosity, Big Naoki sits quietly as Little Naoki writes. For only being two years old, and not having quite fully developed fingers, she handles a quill very well, Naoki muses. Honestly, she finds it somewhat unsettling how this child- which (most probably) isn\u2019t even tangentially related to her, has inherited so many characteristics that mimic her own. Watching the tip of the quill dip and swerve with each consecutive letter, Naoki wonders if there may be some sort of magic in place. At one point, in her earlier years of reading and research, she had once read a thesis that presented the theory that names- the concept of names, are intrinsically tied to a school of ancient magic, and went on to postulate that one\u2019s given name has a measureable and significant effect on how the individual in question develops as a person. At the time, Naoki had dismissed it as nonsense, just as had everyone else who had read it. But watching this girl\u2026 It leads one to wonder, is all. Regardless, Little Naoki is soon finished writing and packing her letter, and seems to be pretty damn smug about the accomplishment. Reaching over to provide congratulatory pats, Naoki speaks, \u201cExcellent work. Let\u2019s go find where your dad keeps his sealing wax.\u201dSliding down off the loveseat, Naoki bends at the knees just in front of the couch, keeping her feet on the ground but bringing her head- and by extension, her shoulders, down to a level just above the surface of the couch. After moving her hair off to one side, Naoki motions first to the envelope and then to her own shoulders, suggesting that Little Naoki hop up, and bring her letter with. ", "1473109935000": "Grasping Little Naoki\u2019s feet with her hands to keep her steady, Naoki carefully rises from her crouching position all the way up to stand at her full height. After pausing for a moment to ensure that her rider is balanced properly and casting an eye at the other children to make sure they\u2019re not doing anything obviously troublesome, Naoki sets off not for the stairs, but rather the kitchen, figuring it would be rude to go rummaging about in Alden\u2019s study without asking, even if the sealing wax is up there. As she steps into the kitchen\u2019s doorway, Naoki reaches one hand over to knock twice on the wall, alerting the occupants of her presence. Not because she doubts that either of them wouldn\u2019t hear her coming, but rather as a courtesy, figuring it good to maintain good habits in the presence of one so impressionable. After taking a moment to observe the happenings and to catch Alden's attention, Naoki speaks, \u201cPardon me, Alden. We Naokies are in need of some sealing wax. Would you happen to have some we could use?\u201d", "1473204023000": "\u201cExcellent, so noted. We\u2019ll be back shortly.\u201dWith that, Naoki sets off for the stairs, utilising her tail to maintain balance as she ascends to the upper floor. After soliciting her rider for directions, Naoki tries the door to Alden\u2019s study and finds it unlocked. Careful not to bump Little Naoki\u2019s head on the doorframe, Naoki proceeds inside and casts an eye about. All in all, Alden\u2019s study seems to be about as one might expect it to be. It features a desk, a table, a few chairs\u2026 aha. The sealing wax, there; on the desk in a tin.Reaching her hands up to grasp her counterpart under the shoulders, Naoki lifts her up, over her own head, and plops her down into the chair just before Alden\u2019s desk. \u201cPut the envelope here, face down.\u201d With one hand, Naoki gestures to the desk\u2019s surface. With the other, she reaches over to the tin, removes the lid, and mercifully enough, finds it to be filled with beads, as opposed to sticks. \u201cNow, this, the process of sealing an envelope with wax, is a bit dangerous; you could singe your little fingers. So allow me to show you how this time, and get your father\u2019s help next time.\u201dAfter Little Naoki has done as instructed, Naoki turns her attention to the candle on Alden\u2019s desk. It is unlit, as it should be, considering fire safety. To remedy this, Naoki reaches into the pouch on her hip and extracts a small, brilliantly cut orange gemstone about the size of her thumbnail. Holding it carefully, she raises it to the unlit candle and activates it, causing a small spurt of magical flame to erupt, lighting the candle and singing her fingers slightly in the process. Though Naoki is careful not to curse aloud, she spends a moment shaking her burned fingers before she slides the gem back into her pouch. Taking the wax spoon in hand, Naoki scoops up a few beads and holds the spoon so Little Naoki can see. \u201cThese little beads are made out of wax. Wax melts easily, hardens quickly, but otherwise isn\u2019t too terribly malleable. That\u2019s why we use it to seal letters, because if someone opens the seal, they can\u2019t close it and make it seem like it was unopened. So what we do is hold the wax over a flame, like this\u2026\u201dNaoki moves the spoon to hold it just above the candle.\u201c... and the wax starts to melt. Don\u2019t get too close.\u201d As they watch the wax melt, Naoki allows a few moments to pass in silence before piping up again, \u201cAnd then, after a short little while, we dump it like this...\u201dSwinging the spoon over, Naoki drops the now-melty pile of wax beads onto the backside of the envelope, in the correct position to be sealed. Setting the spoon off to one side, Naoki takes Alden\u2019s sealing coin and places it atop the wax in the proper position. After that, she moves swiftly to stand behind her counterpart, reaching her arms around, and places one hand on top of the other, and the both of them atop the sealing coin. \u201cNow, quickly, put your hands on top of mine and push!\u201dAfter the stamp is pressed, Naoki would remove her hands, allowing her counterpart to survey their handiwork. ", "1473221743000": "\u201cOi,\u201d Naoki cuts in as her counterpart attempts to snatch the gem. \u201cYou just saw me burn myself with this. Not even a full ten seconds ago! It\u2019s still hot; you shouldn\u2019t try to grab it. Not to mention that it\u2019s mine and if you\u2019d like me to teach you how it works, you probably shouldn\u2019t steal it.\u201d The unspoken implication goes that Naoki would indeed be willing to show her how it works.\u00a0After the seal is stamped with Little Naoki\u2019s assistance, the letter now bearing the official seal of the Sun Marshals, Naoki responds to the inquiry, \u201cMhm, yes; excellent work. Go ahead, I\u2019ll be right behind you.\u201dWith this, she offers Little Naoki a pat on the back to get her going.", "1473278869000": "Making her way back down the stairwell, Naoki arrives just in time to hear Alden address her. A moment is spent considering what the context of his statement might be, but it would stand to reason that Alden wouldn\u2019t allow Little Naoki to head to the mailbox herself; as clever as she may be, she\u2019s also two. Silently, Naoki muses that between the pair of them, they don\u2019t quite enough years to be considered an adult, but that will have to be enough to visit the mailbox.  Nodding in response, Naoki beckons to her counterpart and starts for the door. She would proceed to undo whatever locks are in place, open it, and shut it behind the pair of them once they\u2019re outside. From there, she resolves to follow her diminutive companion to whichever mailbox she might choose to visit, rather than leading the way to the closest one. ", "1473364332000": "Chuckling slightly to herself as she breaks into her most elegant light jog, Naoki hurries over to follow her counterpart. Children, though. Quietly, Naoki remarks that this is probably one of the first times she\u2019s actually dealt with children for any extended length of time, and if this experience is indicative of the whole, children as a topic don\u2019t seem to be that bad.\u201cHere\u2026\u201d Bending at the knees, Naoki grasps the girl around the waist and lifts her up just enough to comfortably fit the envelope into the slot before depositing her back on the ground. Still bent down, Naoki presents the palm of her hand, presumably for slapping. Regardless of whether or not Little Naoki is proficient in the social practice of high-fives, Naoki proceeds to congratulate her, \u201cExcellent work. Let\u2019s get back now.\u201dGesturing, Lady Naoki begins back in the direction of 13 Riverside Drive but is careful to keep an eye on her charge, lest she scuttle off somewhere.

As she moves to reseat herself back on the loveseat, she nods in greeting to the other adults and looks on as the other children seem to have found some toys, carved of wood. Miss Moonflower\u2019s gifts, most probably. Folding her hands in her lap, Naoki resolves to attempt to catch Miss Moonflower for a word before either of them leave.", "1473400179000": "Moving with the group over into the dining room, Naoki does what she can to assist in serving and ensuring the meal goes about as smoothly as it can. Even though the majority of her dining companions don\u2019t seem to have too much regard for table manners, Naoki maintains her high standards, more out of habit than anything else. She finds the meal to quite satisfactory, with a special sort of homemade touch that The Sun can\u2019t quite replicate. During the cleanup phase, Naoki finds an opportunity to pull her counterpart aside for a moment and whisper a suggestion, \u201cYou should ask your aunt for her address, I bet she would love to receive mail from you.\u201dLikewise, the cake is delicious and earns the bakers shining praise from Naoki (even though it\u2019ll probably end up going directly to her hips). As the announcement for bedtime is made, Naoki stands by near the foot of the stairs, intending to offer some assortment of hugs, pats, and \u2018goodnights\u2019 to the children as they pass.

After the children have been successfully escorted upstairs, Naoki turns to respond to Alden, \u201cIt was my pleasure. You raise some fine looking children, Alden.\u201d Waggling her ears, she offers a small smirk. Over the course of the next short while, Naoki remains in the sitting room with Alden, cleaning up the contents of her present, sorting them all away back into the chest from which they came, and making small talk. Naoki doesn\u2019t speak of anything of particular consequence; some topical chit-chat, the price of bread in Gauldin, and other such things. However, just as she\u2019s closing the lid of the chest, she mentions, \u201cBy the way, you see these patterns?\u201dShe gestures to the chest, running her hand across the geometric patterns covering it. Switching to telepathy in the event that any little ears are still awake upstairs, she continues, \u201cThere\u2019s a code in them. A rather difficult code, as codes go. I would ask that once they find out about it, you don\u2019t assist them directly in solving it. No matter how bright they may be, it ought to take them a while to solve, due to the way I\u2019ve incorporated some riddle-like aspects into it. I just mean to make you aware, so you\u2019re not blindsided when they come to with strange questions, or ask to be taken to certain locations to continue solving it. Also, please don\u2019t get rid of the chest. That would sort of render my efforts moot.\u201dWith this communicated, Naoki retakes her position on the loveseat and continues where she left off sipping her water.

Firstly, I would suggest- if you haven\u2019t already, that you leave your mailing address here somewhere the children might be able to get at it. As has been established, I\u2019ve taught Little Naoki how to write letters, and they might find it nice to have another pen pal who doesn\u2019t work just down the street.\u201dWithout pausing for more than a moment or so, Naoki continues, \u201cAnd secondly, you still do woodworking, yes? If you ever find yourself with the time,\u201d Naoki pauses for a moment to gesture to Moonflower\u2019s belly, knowing that her spare time will be very limited proceeding forward, \u201cI\u2019ve begun collecting chess sets, and if you might like to make one- or perhaps a few, I would be very willing to purchase them, having already borne witness to the quality of your work.\u201dTo punctuate this, Naoki offers a slight shrug, intending to indicate that this isn\u2019t at all a massive priority, just an opportunity to consider.

To her credit, Naoki was once very good at this, and today her performance may seem only mildly suspicious to the average onlooker.Though it may not seem it, Naoki has dressed for this occasion. Her sweaterdress goes significantly lower than the waist and covers her chest and shoulders entirely. It is also unnaturally stretchy, tear proof, flame retardant, and impossible to stain. Naoki has even gone to such all but unprecedented lengths to wear something underneath. Truly, she has prepared well for the trial ahead.The front step; she\u2019s made it. Naoki is surprised that she\u2019s been able to avoid detection thus far. There must be a distraction in place, and for that she is thankful.A deep breath in. A deep breath out.

I did\u2026\u201dHolding Little Naoki with one arm, Naoki takes a knee to allow better the other children to get at her. Better that than be brought down, she figures; to surrender on your terms. She greets each child in turn, saying their name, smiling at them, and going for the combination ear scratch, hair rustle, if they\u2019ll have it. Innocuous questions are answered, to the extent of, yes, Naoki has missed them, yes, it has been a long time, yes, she\u2019s happy to see them, and no, she doesn\u2019t have any candy in her pockets. (She doesn\u2019t have any pockets.)Alden is noticed but only for internal purposes, as Naoki doesn\u2019t acknowledge him much further than a significant look and an eye motion intended to indicate the carriage is coming from around the corner. Even if he didn't quite catch all of what she intended to convey, the horses trot their way into view shortly, bringing with them the carriage in question.It isn\u2019t the same bulky, trundling vehicle Naoki uses for long distance travel, but rather the \u201cRoyal Carriage\u201d of Naoki\u2019s collection of carriages. It comes complete with frills, national iconography, and a questionably high amount of gold trim. For the time being it does little other than roll up.

She\u2019ll bring it up again later, Naoki thinks, once things have settled down some.Looking on, Naoki sees Alden, the children. Their expressions and body language, the look in his eyes. In the process of analyzing as she always does, Naoki finds herself in a rush of thoughts and emotions about the whole thing. She comes out the other end watery-eyed and does her best to play it off as she stands up and dusts herself off.

In one hand, she holds a pair of paper bags, both rolled shut. Not in any particular hurry, she meanders her way across the grounds, taking her time to both to appreciate the impeccable landscaping and formulate her thoughts. Soon enough, however, she arrives at the double doors, nods in greeting to the doorman, and proceeds into the foyer. Proceeding directly ahead toward the staircase, she offers another nod to the secretary, and addresses her in passing, \u201cI am going up to see The Administrator.\u201dIt\u2019s more of a courtesy notification than anything else. Considering that the secretary is responsible for who comes and goes and other such matters related to the running of the building, Naoki considers it polite to inform her. Regardless, Naoki proceeds past, and up the stairs. Up to the second, the third, and finally to the top of the stairs, to the mansion\u2019s distinctive tower. On the landing just before the door leading into the tower, she stops, spends a moment to smooth her blouse (though she supposes that it\u2019s a meaningless gesture given who she\u2019s going to see), before knocking on the door. Two knocks, one after the other in quick succession. ", "1469889816000": "Pushing the door open and striding up into the room, Naoki takes a moment to glance around, and upon sighting the room\u2019s occupant, raises her empty hand in greeting, her own lips curving to form a similar smile.  \u201cHello, Takhana.\u201d By this point, Naoki finds herself- if not perhaps accustomed to, at least not unsettled by the way Takhana \u2018looks\u2019. So much communication- body language, is based around the eyes. It\u2019s more frustrating than anything else, really. It makes Takhana\u2019s expressions hard to read, what with not being able to see her eyes or eyebrows. And there\u2019s always the question of if to make \u2018eye contact\u2019 or not. Because Takhana can See, but she can\u2019t see. As Naoki understands it, Takhana wouldn\u2019t really be able to tell where she\u2019s looking, beyond observing the direction her face is pointed in- or even if Naoki were herself wearing a blindfold. So. A bit awkward. Nevertheless, Naoki does turn to look towards Takhana as she moves off to the left side of the room, toward the armchairs. \u201cI brought some muffins. I\u2019m setting them here on the table.\u201dTrue to her word, Naoki does indeed proceed to set one of the paper bags down on the table, making a point of jostling it slightly to crinkle the paper and pointing down at it after she\u2019s placed it. Hopefully, if Takhana\u2019s spatial awareness and depth perception are on point- and they ought to be, Naoki figures- she wouldn\u2019t have much trouble finding the bag. If and when she does, she would find it to contain three muffins, each about three inches across. One blueberry, one vanilla with powdered sugar, and the last chocolate with chunks of chocolate interspersed.With the bag placed, Naoki proceeds to seat herself in one of the armchairs, settling her tail up over the right armrest, and taking a half-moment to cross her legs at the knee- more out of habit than anything else, and smooth her skirt. Her own paper bag is placed on her lap, where it sits upright, unopened.  Having gathered her thoughts, she begins to speak, \u201cI\u2019m here today both for a social visit- it\u2019s been awhile since I\u2019ve seen you, and also to hurl a few questions I\u2019ve been harboring for a while in your direction. Nothing to be concerned about, but things I\u2019d rather discuss in person, if you understand.\u201d\u201cBefore that, though, allow me to offer the mandatory personal inquires, to get them out of the way.

Pulling out a muffin at random, she finds it to be some manner of apple\u2026 thing. Perhaps with cinnamon. Or is it brown sugar\u2026? Her eyebrows squint a bit. Apples are... not her favorite fruit. Regardless, it would be a bit awkward to offer it for trade or put it back into the bag at this point, especially so as Takhana is still speaking, so Naoki opts to bite the bullet. Or the muffin, as the case may be. She finds that for whatever reason, the muffin has chosen to accentuate the portion of the apple\u2019s taste that she dislikes the most, the sour sort of tang. Idly, she wonders whyyyyyy. Regardless, she manages to internalize all feelings of disgust, and listens politely as she picks at the muffin, nodding once Takhana has finished. \u201cThat\u2019s all good to hear. I would rather things be going smoothly and largely uneventfully than otherwise. Interesting times and all that.\u201d\u201cThings with me... Are... Not necessarily eventful, not any more so than they have been. I expected this level of\u2026 of\u00a0happenings and events and such as I was coming into this. They are beginning to get tiring, though. I\u2019ve lost some portion of the enthusiasm I started with. The difficult decisions are starting to come in, along with the political complications.\u201dShe pauses for a moment, constructing her thoughts before continuing,\u00a0\u201cIf I might draw a metaphor for a moment, it\u2019s as if I\u2019m juggling. I cannot, actually, but it is as if I\u2019m juggling, and though I\u2019m not necessarily being thrown new balls to keep in the air, it\u2019s as if the balls are constantly, subtly changing. Getting heavier while they\u2019re in the air. Staying up for longer than they did the last time, floating around a bit, becoming cubic, or developing a coating of slime, that gets onto my hand and then onto the other balls and then all the balls are slimy and my arms are tired I don\u2019t want to juggle anymore as much as I would like to go clean my hands and attend to personal matters, such as marrying Kate, and running away to go live with her in some little cottage in the middle of nowhere where I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about such things as public opinion, my image, the wording on laws and which words I choose to use when speaking, the city\u2019s perception of the ideals it was founded under, what foreign dignitaries think of the dress I\u2019m wearing, and just speaking broadly, politics in general.\u201dShe pauses, realizing that she\u2019s breathing heavily. Consciously, she slows, and takes a few deep breaths for good measure, fully composing herself before continuing, \u201cSo I suppose it is all rather stressful, is what I mean to get at. The issue comes in wherein if the balls hit the floor, civilization as we know it stops functioning, and nobody else in the room knows how to juggle to the degree I think is necessary to juggle the balls.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve been trying to prepare successors. Our mutual friend Ms. Untyrid, Jun- who I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve met, and to a lesser extent, my Skarlet. But I can\u2019t shake the doubt that none of them are ever really going to be prepared, and well suited enough that I would be willing to entrust the nation to them. So I suppose I\u2019m having difficulty accepting the fact that I\u2019m going to be doing this until either I break under the pressure, I die, or am assassinated.\u201d\u201cAnd then I start trying to think about which one of those is most likely to happen first, and it\u2019s a downward spiral from there. \u2026 The worst bit- or rather, one of the worst bits is such that I\u2019m not even doing the job to the extent that I\u2019d really like to be doing it right now, anyway. There\u2019s room for improvement that I can see, and aspire to do, but simply can\u2019t push myself to spend time on. ... I\u2019m sympathising with Ildesias more each day- even with the extensive network of delegation I\u2019ve established. It\u2019s all really quite terrible, if I\u2019m to be honest about it. But there\u2019s nobody else to do it, so I do, and I manage, and the nation functions, and I don\u2019t think I\u2019m insane yet.\u201d\u201c... Though if I were, I suppose I wouldn\u2019t know, would I.\u201dAgain, she pauses. Briefly, she considers apologizing for laying all of that onto Takhana\u2019s shoulders, but assumes that she would wave off her apology anyway, and doesn\u2019t bother. Thinking that she\u2019s just about covered the city as well as personal matters, she opts to continue addressing Takhana\u2019s questions.\u201cAs for Miss Green, things are going well, both with her individually and between the pair of us. Aside from not having as much time to spend together as we\u2019d like, there haven\u2019t been any major complications or issues so far, and I\u2019m thankful for that.\u201d While Naoki doesn\u2019t exactly trail off, she does avert her gaze from the other woman, opting to instead gaze out the window, her mind\u2019s eye having slid to another topic, at least for a moment. Whether that subject is her dearly beloved or, \u201cWhy are there windows? She\u2019s blind,\u201d is anyone\u2019s guess.", "1470078110000": "Naoki waves her hand dismissively, not all at concerned that Takhana doesn\u2019t have any advice to offer. She didn\u2019t expect her to. \u201cThat\u2019s fine,\u201d Naoki begins, \u201cAll I\u2019ve done here is accurately identify the reality of the situation, articulate it, and state that I\u2019m not pleased with it. There\u2019s nothing to do or be done besides what already is. I\u2019ll continue to look for someone to succeed me, even though the odds of success are low, and you\u2019ll continue to do what you do and listen to me rant every so often. It\u2019s helpful for me to simply say all of that, to speak nothing of how much pride I have in the accuracy of that metaphor.\u201d\u201cWith that said, though, allow me to continue to the first and only matter of strictly business that I have to bring to your attention. I didn\u2019t need to come all the way over here to tell you this, but this is a social visit. Anyway, as you\u2019re well aware, a few months previously, a dragon attacked Isra. The big one with the table in the central plaza, where Miss Jun lost her pants.\u201dSmirking slightly to herself in reminiscence, Naoki continues, \u201cAnd as you\u2019ll remember, we subdued and captured it. It was placed in the descriptively-named \u2018Cube\u2019 beneath the Citadel, and there it has slept, these past few months. \u2026 Recently, however, there have been stirrings. It\u2019s becoming more active, and we suspect that it might wake soon. I suspect that it\u2019s going to become a problem again. A problem that will need to be dealt with.\u201dThe sharpness in her tone implies that if a permanent solution is required to protect the city, she wouldn\u2019t mind too terribly much. \u201cAnd, in typical fashion for myself, I would like to assign the problem to someone else so I don\u2019t have to deal with it. That would be where you come in.\u201dAt this, Naoki inclines her head to the side, in Takhana\u2019s direction, referring to \u2018her\u2019 in the sense of The Sun Marshals, and whoever she might care to assign to the issue, if she\u2019d not prefer to handle it personally. \u201cTechnically, of course, it\u2019s the responsibility of the Judiciary Department. But they\u2019re a department that is designed to deal with pickpockets and thieves. Not so much ancient dragons of questionable allegiance and mental state. I think that Minister Deathforge will be able to recognize that he\u2019s not equipped properly, and accept assistance, provided that it is provided politely, and doesn\u2019t throw its weight around to muddy up his procedures and protocols. How you\u2019d like to handle it is, obviously, up to you. I don\u2019t even know how to begin approaching the issue.\u201dHere, she pauses, expecting Takhana to nod, and perhaps articulate the first step she might take.", "1470170814000": "A small sort of smile spreads its way across Naoki\u2019s face as Takhana speaks. It\u2019s always comforting to see competent individuals confident in their ability to solve complex and incredibly dangerous problems on her behalf. As an afterthought, she adds, \u201cIf possible, it would be ideal if we could figure out which dragon this is, and why they did what they did. There aren\u2019t too many thousand-plus year old dragons kicking around, and any insight into their identity or motives would be appreciated.\u201dWith the matter of that dragon closed, Naoki pauses for a moment to collect her thoughts before beginning to speak once again, in a somewhat less-lighthearted tone, \u201cNow, the majority of the information you deal with is quite classified, due to the nature of your job and all that. However, I\u2019d like to ask that from this point in our conversation onward, that you not record or repeat any of the items I\u2019m going to tell you for any reason short of saving a life.\u201d\u201cHowever, before I launch into my spiel, let me ask you this question. \u2026 In a conversation I shared with our mutual friend Ms. Untyrid, she said, \u2018With the aid of your scryer, I have determined that what the wizard said is true: My people are dead, my homeland taken over by darkness.\u2019\u201dOnce again, Naoki\u2019s abilities of impersonation are on-point as she mimics Emahra\u2019s elven accent. She takes a moment to polish off her muffin and place the bag off to one side before continuing, \u201cI would like to inquire not about anything personal regarding Ms. Untyrid\u2019s homeland- those details are hers to share or not as she sees fit, but rather about the process by which you determined that her suspicions were true. It would seem to me as if your abilities in scrying extend beyond this world, and I\u2019m curious about the topic.\u201dHere, Naoki stops, folding her hands in her lap, prompting Takhana to elaborate as she sees fit.", "1470177610000": "\u201cHm.\u201dA long silence follows. A long, contemplative silence on Naoki\u2019s part. One she spends in deep thought, eyes looking out the window, but not actively observing what they see.After a few moments, she continues, still gazing idly toward the window, \u201cI see. So it isn\u2019t as if you\u2019d be able to accomplish a similar feat without a focus, then.\u201d Her tone seems almost disappointed. Another moment, and she returns, shifting her gaze back over to focus on Takhana, and inquiring more pointedly,\u201cWhat sorts of items would be suitable to be a focus, then? And, how accurate is your ability, generally speaking? If I gave you, say, something from Gauldin- a territory you\u2019re at least marginally familiar with, would you be able to tell me, which city, perhaps?...\u201d", "1470193747000": "\u201cOh, well then. That works out just perfectly.\u201dComplete sarcasm. \u201cI\u2019ll go ahead and get to the point, then. Look at me for a moment.\u201dThis is, of course, a rhetorical. Takhana has been looking at her the entire time. Still, she raises one hand to indicate the side of her own head, and waggles her ears slightly to draw attention to them. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a functioning set of eyeballs or a scrying crystal to see that I\u2019m not quite right. Not quite human. Sub-human or super-human, the distinction is yours so make, but ultimately irrelevant. The question is, however, begged: \u2018What is she?\u2019\u201d\u201cAnd one would think, \u2018Well, she\u2019s a cat\u2026 thing-person. Of some sort. I have never asked, truthfully. But surely Naoki knows what she is. She knows what sort of lingerie Queen Arianne wears, surely she would know something like that.'\u201dNaoki\u2019s voice adopts a smooth sort of edge that is almost reminiscent of Takhana\u2019s own tone as she draws the dialogism, but not not quite so much so as to be mocking, and not quite so accurate as to be an honest-to-goodness impersonation. \u201cJoke being, of course: I do not. The truth of the matter is such that my memories only extend about ten years and a handful of months back from today. And they are me- albeit a somewhat smaller and exceedingly naive me- waking up in an alley.\u201dApparently unable to stay seated, Naoki rises from her seat, and begins to pace off to one side of the room, one hand clasped tightly in the other behind her back. \u201cTo rephrase, I don\u2019t know any more than you- or anyone else, really, what sort of thing I am. And while it would be tempting to assume that I am a creature like Alden\u2019s children- Have you seen them? They\u2019re very cute. Amusingly enough, the one named after me seems to be taking after me in all of the best ways, and it\u2019s amusing. But I digress. While the easy solution would be to assume that I am the product of the love between a human-like being and some manner of anthropomorphic cat-person, the differences extend deeper. Beneath the skin.\u201dHaving reached one side of the room, she begins to pace back, and off to the other side, now using her hands to provide gesticulatory emphasis to each phrase and clause.\u201cHumor me here for a moment, but I\u2019m convinced that I am fundamentally a different sort of thing. For instance, my memory. My memory is perfect. I don\u2019t mean to exaggerate, it simply is. Every bit of sensory input I recognize, I store, I remember, and can recall later without much hassle. Additionally, either as a subset of the last thing or an independent sort of thing, I learn differently. In some cases, very easily. For instance, I learned Gauldish over a weekend. Simply for fun. Yet, when it comes to more\u2026 fiddly things, more intuition based skills, such as plant care, what to wear, cooking\u2026 contractions, I struggle. \u2026\u201d\u201cI recently played a game of chess with Ms. Untyrid. In attempting to consider each available move, each option and evaluate them to choose the most ideal one, I struggled, overwhelmed. There are thousands upon thousands of options. And I realize that that\u2019s not how one is meant to play the game, but I seem to be unable to go about it in any other way. I was able to verbally teach her- who had never even so much as heard the word \u201cchess\u201d before, the theory behind it- enough so that she won our game- but not actually execute the same theory myself. I eventually started to evaluate only fifty possibilities in-between each move, and simply choose one of those. This lead to me getting caught in very simple traps, and losing the game because of it.\u201dThough she doesn\u2019t raise her volume above what might be considered a reasonable level for speaking to someone from across a room, it\u2019s abundantly clear that she\u2019s very frustrated with the whole affair by the irritation seeping into each word, as well as the resentment practically dripping from her voice.\u201cI am the sort to plan and systemize to the point of absurdity, and disregard all aspects of a matter that are seemingly irrelevant to what I am considering. I find it extremely difficult to deal with variables I cannot measure and quantify. My mind functions in a manner that would seem to be entirely unlike every individual I have encountered to date. Even in attempting to understand others, I systemize and form models, which, while sometimes accurate enough for my purposes, still fail regularly, as I cannot form a perfect model of the human mind.\u201d\u201cAnd,\u201d she continues, brandishing a her index finger as one might brandish a rapier, \u201cOn top of that, on top of the ears and the tail and the mind and all, I\u2019m sterile. I could elaborate with all the detail of a mind that never forgets, but you\u2019ll want to just take my word for it, I think.\u201dHaving completed her circuit around the room, Naoki flops backward into her seat in a decidedly unladylike movement. For a few moments, she simply sits, pouting. After a moment, she kicks off her sandals, bringing her feet up to rest on the cushion of the seat. Wrapping her arms about her knees and settling her chin atop one of her lower-arms, she continues, more quietly, but still with that edge of irritation, \u201cIt\u2019s all immensely frustrating. Not knowing what sort of thing I am. Not knowing where I came from, the circumstances that brought me into this world- be they birth, construction, or transportation across the planes. Not knowing if I have ever so much as had any brethren. I squirm in that manner of uncertainty. And the general frustration that comes in operating on a day to day basis! I like to think that I do a reasonable job of hiding it, of coming off as more or less normal. Functioning as most people do in civilised society, going about my business; working, living, loving. \u2026 I actually maintain a model of the person I\u2019d like to be, and use that for interacting with people. But I myself would be much more suited to sitting in a small box and doing mathematical calculations than I would be to attend a ball or the sort of statecraft I do.\u201d The word is uttered with unmasked disgust. \u201cI was hoping that you would be able to work your magic and provide me some facts. I have tried to find facts before. A goodly portion of dear Mr. Cresno\u2019s time was occupied by my searches.\u201dBased upon the fact that she does not continue, it would probably be a safe assumption to presume that Mr. Cresno never found anything in particular. At least, as it relates to the manner she\u2019s referring to.", "1470313696000": "At Takhana\u2019s mention of this secondary sort of process, one ear- which had been flattened along with its counterpart, perks up, turning to point in her direction. A half-moment later, the rest of Naoki\u2019s head follows suit, turning to eye Takhana with a look. A careful sort of look; a deliberately restrained look. A look that doesn\u2019t dare to be hopeful. Her request is simply stated, \u201cTell me about it.\u201d", "1470505088000": "\u201cOh, fun.\u201dAgain, with the sarcasm. Uncharacteristically, Naoki seems to ignore the mention of 'close physical proximity,' not even so much as smirking. Whether this is out of respect for Takhana cultured sensibilities or simply a byproduct of her agitation is left to one\u2019s interpretation. \u201cUnfortunately,\u201d she continues, again swinging her gaze off toward the opposite wall, \u201cI do not have the option. I can\u2019t afford to be completely out of commision for an unscheduled, indefinite amount of time. Neither can you, for that matter. Things would stop working. People would start wondering, and knowing my luck, something important would catch on fire.\u201dA pause of three beats, and she continues, \u201cI can schedule it, though. I need to prepare things for unscheduled absences anyway. ... Later today, I\u2019ll review my schedule and set aside some time for this. In the meantime, I\u2019ll practice. I\u2019ll look into scrying, and try focusing energies into other things, so it\u2019ll be that much easier when the time comes. I don\u2019t suppose you exactly have any books on the matter, but I would postulate that The Enclave has something at least tangentially related to what you\u2019re referring to. Scrying using a living soul as a focus...\u201dAt this point, she stops, deep in the throes of contemplation. Stating it in the way she did, thoughts of Mr. Screwtape come to mind, and the question is begged if the same sort of process can be used on souls that have since been separated from their original owner. Though she doesn\u2019t voice any of those sorts of questions aloud. ", "1470564083000": "As Takhana\u2019s hand settles atop her own, Naoki jumps slightly in her seat, genuinely surprised. Quite frankly, she hadn\u2019t been expecting it, and wasn\u2019t watching. Takhana isn\u2019t usually one for physical gestures; she isn\u2019t one for hugs, and usually isn\u2019t even game for handshakes. However, Naoki makes no effort to dissuade her, seeing at least some manner of significance in the gesture, and honestly not minding at all. Instead, her expression of surprise shifts into one of deep gratitude, complete with raised eyebrows and wide smile. \u201cThank you, Takhana.\u201dThough she supposes that it would be highly awkward and probably unwelcome of her to cross over and hug Takhana, Naoki hopes that her sentiment is adequately expressed. She does, however, resolve to have more pastries sent over throughout the coming weeks as edible tokens of appreciation. Even though Naoki remains doubtful regarding the whole endeavor, it\u2019s immensely comforting to know that Takhana is willing to do everything she can to assist. After allowing a few moments to pass in silence to properly shelve the matter for the time being, Naoki pipes up again, with a decidedly more light and conversational tone. \u201cSay. Completely unrelated, but have you been keeping up with the events over on The Expanse\u2019s southern border?\u201d", "1470628084000": "Sliding her feet down off the seat and back into her sandals, Naoki nods. \u2018Troublesome\u2019 is certainly one way to put it. However, it wouldn\u2019t seem like Takhana has much more to say regarding her premonition. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest, I find the whole affair quite unsettling. A new brand of destructive force, dropping in and wreaking havoc on The Expanse. If not for the swift intervention of Commodore Finch and the other considerably powerful independent parties providing assistance, The Land Tillers would have likely been prevented from forming a cohesive defense and overrun. On top of that, we don\u2019t know what it is, or where it came from. Or if something similar will strike again. \u2026 I don\u2019t like unknowns.\u201dFor a moment or so, Naoki leaves the room in a pensive sort of silence before another thought strikes her, \u201cI think I\u2019m nearly finished with matters I wanted to discuss with you, so allow me to voice my last- or, rather, second to last question.\u201dA moment's pause to collect her thoughts before Naoki continues, \u201cI\u2019m trying to lower my dependence on others and diversify my set of skills. Riding is a useful skill to have, so I\u2019ve been contemplating obtaining a mount of some sort. I\u2019ve not settled on what sort of thing, though.\u201d\u201cOf course, Ildesias, he has his griffin, and that\u2019s sort of the obvious choice, given the existing infrastructure and number of competent riders. I\u2019m sure the Commodore would be more than willing to assist me with that. But at the same time- and don\u2019t tell her I said this, but griffins are a bit bland, don\u2019t you think? A bit standard. We\u2019ve got legions upon legions of them, and while the legions are very nice, having a griffin isn\u2019t exactly unique.\u201d\u201cAnd, I suppose I don\u2019t really have to have something unique. ... But there are so many options. It wouldn\u2019t be terribly difficult to procure a pegasus, but they\u2019re also not particularly flashy most of the time, and Liz would never hear the end of it from the Gauldish. I could spring for something terribly exotic\u2026 but\u2026\u201dNaoki shrugs. \u201cI suppose I\u2019m both asking for your opinion and asking you to keep your ey- I mean, maintain a lookout for something that might be suitable.\u201dShe shrugs again. \u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t intend to take very much action regarding this in the near future, but this is a pleasant enough topic to discuss, a nice enough note to end on, I figure.\u201d With that said, Naoki puts a stop to her ramblings and allows Takhana to respond.\u00a0", "1470726804000": "A slowly nodding, contemplative sort of expression begins to form as Takhana mentions dragons. It's a bit of an unweidly topic to consider, but something indeed to consider. However, Naoki\u2019s train of thought is violently thrown off its tracks as Takhana mentions the cats. She pauses for a moment, seemingly frozen in place, before her ears twitch a bit- as if they didn\u2019t quite hear properly. \u201cReally.\u201dSwiveling her entire torso to face Takhana, Naoki gives her her best appraising look. Is this\u2026 Is this Takhana\u2019s sense of humor? The fabled and thought lost\u00a0sense of humor, which only presents itself in the face of mortal peril?Just to be safe, Naoki\u2019s ears swivel about once again, making sure that no mortal peril makes itself readily apparent. It does not. Takhana seems to be straight-facing it, as well. Naoki\u2019s eyes rise with some manner of indescribable emotion. Perhaps disbelief. Perhaps amusement. It\u2019s probably pretty hard to tell when one lacks eyes, anyway. After a moment or so, Naoki composes herself ever so slightly in a flurry of movement, weaving the fingers of her hands together and pointing her index fingers in Takhana\u2019s direction, keeping the pads of her thumbs back and pressed together. \u201cGiant\u2026 Cats,\u201d The words are accompanied by pointed gestures. \u201cAs in, horse size... cats that are large enough to ride, and are kept as beasts of burden.\u201dA deeply contemplative look works its way onto Naoki\u2019s face, etching her way into her features as she relaxes back into the seat. The deepest of contemplations. Which would- apparently, seem to involve pressing the tip of her tongue between her lips, a somewhat silly expression, really. Behind her, soft, swishing noises are heard; the sound of tail on armchair.After a moment that seems like not nearly enough time to consider such an incredible topic thoroughly, she continues. Slowly, ponderously, as if speaking each word for the first time, \u201cWhat you mean to tell me, is that- through some means or another, there exists the possibility of obtaining a cat, outfitting it with armor, and riding into battle on\u2026 a battle-cat.\u201dLooking up at last, Naoki internally laments Takhana\u2019s lack of traditional eyes. It makes it very difficult to establish intense eye contact. Staring intently at the cloth will have to suffice, she supposes.\u201cDo they... Do they do that?\u201d She would presumably be referring to the elves previously mentioned.\u00a0", "1470900342000": "Naoki\u2019s contemplative look remains, and as Takahana speaks, she accentuates it with small nods. \u201cHm. We\u2019ll have to do that, then, if only for the novelty factor. Perhaps Ryden could head over there.\u201dTabling the matter of cats in her mind, she continues by jumping back to Takhana\u2019s second-to-last suggestion, \u201cA dragon of some variety may be suitable as well, though. Issue therein being that they\u2019re a very varied and very fickle sort- like humans. It would be a challenge to locate a dragon who would\u2026 fit. I\u2019m not big into arrogance or burning houses or any of that. Still, if the right one came along and was willing, I\u2019d jump at the chance.\u201dThe unspoken follow up, of course, being that Takhana keep her mind\u2019s eye open for such things. With all of that seemingly finished with, though, Naoki considers for a moment what else she might have to say, before remembering a request: \u201cOh, if you would be so kind, please maintain surveillance on the foreign delegations when they arrive for the summit. Send a few Marshals out to remain in their general proximity with orders to intervene if something untoward might happen. It wouldn\u2019t look good if some king died to a common thief on our streets, nor would I be pleased if the delegations leave us some nasty surprises, or use the visit as a front to cover for some covert operations of their own.\u201d", "1470983559000": "Naoki nods, accepting Takhana\u2019s suggestions. She had been half-joking when she had mentioned Ryden anyway, implying that she\u2019d send him simply to get him out of her hair. Akai'a is almost certainly the far more competent diplomat in situations such at this one. And again she nods at Takhana\u2019s response to the request, waiting until it seems as if she\u2019s finished before continuing herself, \u201cAnd now, for my final question, and perhaps the most crucial inquiry of the lot.\u201dShe pauses, applying dramatic effect and making 'eye contact', before continuing in a low and most serious tone, \u201cWhat\u2026 is your favorite variety and flavor of pastry?\u201d", "1471151522000": "As Takahana laughs, a faint sort of smile pulls at the corners of Naoki\u2019s mouth. She finds it pleasant to note that she\u2019s still capable of making people laugh, but the focus of her thoughts still hasn\u2019t moved on from the earlier conversation- regarding her origin. Having articulated her pains to another, they still linger in the forefront of her mind, and the rest simply seems like a distraction. Regardless, as competent as she is in hiding such things, Naoki nods solemnly, making a mental note of the mentioned bakery, and continuing with the same jokingly serious tone she was using previously, \u201cI see; so noted. You should expect... deliveries.\u201dIf one were only listening to Naoki\u2019s half of the conversation, they might think that she were discussing delivering something horrible. With that said, however, she drops the tone and moves to stand, stretching her back as she continues, \u201cI think that about concludes the matters I wanted to speak with you about, though. I\u2019ve asked you my questions, made my requests, had some muffins, and enjoyed the time we\u2019ve spent together just now. Unless you\u2019ve got anything more, I think I\u2019ll make my exit.\u201d", "1471232263000": "Naoki mirrors Takhana\u2019s nod, even going so far as to lean forward slightly- more than she does for most. \u201cYou too, Takhana. I\u2019ll speak with you later.\u201dPicking up her bag- still with two muffins in, Naoki offers a smile and a wave before turning to the door and striding out, being careful to shut it quietly behind her. ", "1472052609000": "Without announcement or fanfare, Madame Naoki arrives at The Sun Marshal Headquarters. On this fine morning of mornings, she is wearing one of her white blouse/black skirt combos, and carries no additional accoutrements besides her pouch of gemstones. Quietly, and with perhaps a touch of fatigue, she makes her way inside, stopping in the entryway, holding one hand behind her back. Silently, she hopes to herself that Takhana is more well rested and enthusiastic about things than she is right now. Though, she supposes, Takhana isn\u2019t very enthusiastic about things, generally speaking. Regardless, Naoki stands, half-asleep on her feet, waiting to be approached. ", "1472060601000": "As Takhana addresses her, Naoki offers a nod of greeting of her own, and a small sort of apologetic shrug, as if to say, 'More or less.'Turning next to face Lamina, Naoki gets a good look at her for the first time, eyeing her up as Takhana performs the introductions. She\u2019s not the strangest looking person, Naoki muses. A fairly normal looking young woman, really. But then again, Naoki supposes it that it would take someone awfully strange to earn the title in her book these days. Nodding in response to the curtsy, Naoki returns the greeting casually in a half-hearted attempt to put the girl at ease, \u201cMhm. Likewise, Ms. Manira. I had the pleasure of watching your matches yesterday, and have high hopes for you here, among the Marshals.\u201dWith that done, Naoki shuffles over to the library door, making her way in behind Takhana Naoki opts to select the seat two spaces to Takhana\u2019s right, settling herself into it carefully, making quite sure not to sit on her tail- as she has a habit of doing when fatigued. As she waits for Lamina to presumably proceed in and seat herself, Naoki adopts a contemplative sort of expression, resting one elbow on the table and her chin in her hand. A deeply contemplative expression, even. Or is she nodding off...? It\u2019s hard to say. ", "1472067292000": "Naoki nods once, accepting Takhana\u2019s offered tea with a small smile. Warm drinks, even if they are just leaves in hot water, are almost always appreciated by Naoki, simply by virtue of being warm. Taking one short sip to sample it, Naoki nods, finding it more or less to he r\u201cAlright, so. I\u2019m not sure what all you\u2019ve been told, but I feel it necessary to give you a rundown, a summary of sorts. You ought to know what you\u2019re getting into.\u201dWith her tea-less hand, Naoki gestures to the room around them, intending to refer not quite to the library, but rather to the building, the Headquarters, and the organization at large. \u201cThe Sun Marshals; paramilitary force. Looks kinda like a military, functions like a military, but isn\u2019t technically a component of Isra\u2019s military. Instead, The Marshals exist in a unique space, outside the law. Marshals answer to nobody but Alden- who you\u2019ve met, Takahana here, and myself. In turn, the two of them answer only to me. The Assembly, Chancellor Greyiron, the rest of Isra\u2019s government, and Isra\u2019s military officers can do no more than make requests of The Marshals.\u201dGradually, Naoki begins to allow her arm to speak as well- the arm with her teacup, no less. Swinging it about, pointing, using motions to punctuate her sentences and provide emphasis to her most important points. \u201cWith this unique sort of spot, The Marshals have a collection of unique responsibilities. Generally speaking, anything of significant priority that cannot be accomplished by the traditional military. To draw a comparison, you can\u2019t drive a nail with a handsaw. Likewise, some jobs cannot be accomplished with legions of spearmen and griffin cavalry. Sometimes, more finesse is required. More discreet agents, more personally talented individuals. Soldiers don\u2019t necessarily make good bodyguards, and sometimes, one needs bodyguards. I\u2019m sure that you can at least identify the niche The Marshals fill, if not perhaps fully understand the depth of it just now. You\u2019ll come to understand more fully in time, I\u2019m sure.\u201dPausing only long enough to take another sip of her tea, Naoki continues to both wave the cup about in enthusiastic gesticulation. It\u2019s a miracle she hasn\u2019t spilled it yet. \u201cAnd then, with the unique spot, and the unique responsibilities, The Marshals also employ a number of highly unique individuals. I\u2019m not sure who you\u2019ve met outside of Alden and Takhana, but The Marshals are a fairly motley crew, as far as crews go. In addition to employing individuals skilled in the martial arts, there are doctors, engineers, mages, all sorts of people, hailing from all over. Humans and elves and drow and everything, really. Very meritocratic sort of thing- it doesn\u2019t matter who or what an individual is or are as long as they are  able do the job well.\u201dOpening her mouth as if to continue, Naoki realizes that she\u2019s been going on for quite a bit and that what all she just said is probably a fair bit of  information to take in. Hence, she pauses, taking another sip of her drink and waiting for either Lamina to pose a question or perhaps for Takahan to continue where she left off. ", "1472112429000": "Watching and listening carefully, Naoki offers the occasional nod as Takhana continues the explanation. She has no supplementary comments to offer, Takhana having adequately covered the areas she touched on. However, Naoki feels the need to come back around and emphasise a few points under the topic of \u2018training\u2019. \u201cThe majority of the time, there won\u2019t be any designated task or mission for you to attend to. Days and weeks may go by without any major assignments. Even with Ms. Untyrid mentoring you and dictating how you\u2019ll spend your day, and even once your training is \u2018officially\u2019 complete, you\u2019re going to find yourself with many hours to spend. However, as opposed to loafing about and spending your time on idle and meaningless pursuits, you will be expected to spend your time- at least the majority of it- well, by developing and increasing your own capabilities and serving the city in small ways.\u201d\u201cFor example, your penmanship could use work.\u201d With her left hand, Naoki gestures casually to the forms, intending to call Lamina\u2019s less-than-stellar handwriting to attention. Taking another sip of her tea, Naoki finishes her cup and places it down upon the saucer with all due delicacy. \u201cI would suggest that you spend some time reading and writing, practicing, refining your script, in the event you ever have to write anything in the scope of your assignments. Beyond that, and perhaps more importantly, I would also suggest that you spend a fair amount of time familiarizing yourself with Isra- sooner rather than later. As I understand, you\u2019ve only been around for a few days- only since the tournament began or so. To be effective in operating within the city, you are going to need to know how to get from point to point, and know what individuals are referring to when they reference a location or another individual. Spend a few days in exploration for the sake of it. Perhaps Ms. Untyrid would give you a tour.\u201d Naoki shrugs, unsure of how Emahra might decide to do things. Heck, she may not have even been notified yet. It's really too early in the morning to say, Naoki muses. Regardless, Naoki thinks that she\u2019s made her suggestion clear enough. \u201cYour goal should be to become as skilled, well rounded, and well versed as you possibly can be. To be able to intelligently approach any task that might be given you- no matter what it may be, and to have the skills required to deal with it. To quote a man I once knew\u2026\u201dEmploying her skill of impersonation, Naoki adopts the voice of an elderly-sounding gentleman, of the sort you may expect to hear from a duke, or a scholar, perhaps. \u201cAn individual should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, forge metal, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.\u201d Dropping the accent, Naoki continues in her own voice, \u201cYou\u2019re not going to be expected to be able to do all of things, of course- that would be somewhat unreasonable and highly arbitrary, but I think I\u2019ve made myself clear. Apply that philosophy to yourself and utilise the resources at your disposal to become the best and most qualified version of yourself you possibly can be.\u201dNaoki punctuates her last statement with a solid nod, indicating that she's finished with that bit. ", "1472163521000": "Idly, Naoki notes that Lamina is hardly the most obviously expressive young woman she\u2019s ever met. Perhaps that would translate well into negotiation skills. \u201cAllow me to preface as such. From this point forward, you are safe. As safe as anyone can be in such a position. With that badge, an attack on you would construe an attack on Isra itself, and I would treat it as such. And while Goraia might be awful in so many ways, I don\u2019t think they\u2019re as blatantly stupid as all that. The assassins should stop.\u201dThe tone of her voice implies rather clearly that if they don\u2019t, more drastic action would be taken. \u201cHowever, I would quite like to know some of the details you have. One of my informants was something of a fan of yours, actually- back in Medan. However, I lost contact with them as the coup was taking place, and the depth of my knowledge as it pertains to the coup and the events immediately following is... questionable, at best. I have a few scattered accounts, but most of them were from refugees hailing from the outer peripheries of Medan, and weren't in the cities at the time. As I understand, you were.\u201dPausing and offering Lamina a significant look, Naoki considers leaving it there, but decides that more elaboration would be well-placed. \u201cSo, I suppose what I\u2019m getting at here is that I\u2019d like to know what you know about the whole debacle. Your point of view, as it were. As mentioned, there\u2019s going to be a summit in a few days, and Goraia is sending an ambassador. I would, ideally, like to know the specifics of how you were mistreated with enough detail to play the pity card well against their delegation, and turn the other leaders against them. This is going to be a massive opportunity to truly do lasting damage to Goraia, and I would prefer not to let it slip by.\u201dShe's careful to emphasize the word 'prefer', attempting to make it clear that this is not an order or an official request. \u201cHowever, I understand- more than most, that such things, such painful times, can sometimes be... difficult to contemplate and relate. However, the information would really help. This is about as good of a shot as you\u2019re going to get at seeing their tyrannical regime removed, and if I can do anything further to assist- perhaps you\u2019d rather not speak directly to me; I can leave. Or if you\u2019d prefer to create a written account, or have someone read your memories, we can make any accommodation.\u201dHere, Naoki does her best to seem empathetic, lowering her voice and adopting a more personal tone in an attempt to encourage Lamina to open up. ", "1472181635000": "Naoki simply sits. Fingers woven together, resting on the table. Her tail has made itself scarce, provide no distractions. She looks to Lamina with a carefully neutral, comforting sort of look. The sort of look that one might adopt when quietly grieving, or preparing to listen to a harrowing encounter such as this one. However, she does not speak, silently prompting Lamina to continue at her own pace. ", "1472285725000": "Listening to Lamina continue, Naoki bites her lip, but does her very best to continue thinking clearly. What she does find interesting to note is how Lamina was taken to their prison, and, notably, made it out. None of the other accounts she had listened to had done that. But it still remained to be seen, who she was to be a \u201cgift\u201d to. Perhaps that \u201cLord Zephidel\u201d character, or another high ranking official. Perhaps she would have some insight on what they\u2019re like in person. ", "1472334477000": "Quietly, Naoki watches Takhana\u2019s quill as it continues to transcribe Lamina\u2019s words, and the atrocities contained within. Truthfully, Naoki had- up until this point, tried to keep an open mind in regards to Goraia. She had tried to open diplomatic negotiations earlier. She had tried to refrain from forming her own opinion without multiple and accurate sources to base it upon. Tried to seriously consider the notion of all of their killing as part of the coup, and had even gone so far as to investigate historical records to see if the coup would be justified for any reason.But this. The Goraian representative won\u2019t have a reasonable explanation for this, because no legitimate excuse for this level of needless, senseless abuse exists! Thinking about it for a moment, Naoki attempts to form a mental list of each sort of abuse mentioned so far. Halfway through, she gets frustrated and stops, taking a moment to clear her thoughts. Because there\u2019s a line. For instance, Naoki, personally, doesn\u2019t really mind tossing people in cells. Sometimes people need to be detained, and that's all well and good. Or roughing up prisoners to get out information that would be beneficial in preventing more crime in the future. Or, even, for that matter, a little bit of torture, if the information in question is valuable enough. Reading minds against one\u2019s will, execution of particularly dangerous prisoners, and life sentences, all fine. All on one side of Naoki\u2019s line, in the \u201cacceptable under circumstances\u201d category. But then there\u2019s that line that separates the preceding category from \u201cviolence for the sake of violence\u201d, \u201cabuse for the sake of abusing\u201d and so on. Just as there is a difference to be noted between the thief who steals bread to live and the thief who steals jewels to live luxuriously, so to is there a difference- at least as far as Naoki is concerned, between the government who detains criminals and miscreants, and the government that imprisons and abuses individuals who have done nothing to them. To know that not only did such things happen in Goraia under their management, but actually directly involved their head of state\u2026 Any level of doubt regarding questionable practices or open mindedness Naoki may have previously possessed regarding Goraia is gone. The notion that perhaps it was just a particularly bloody coup with some rumors- absolutely and totally gone. Her willingness to consider the nation itself as potentially of any use, or even worth dealing with. All whisked away and promptly destroyed; vanished never to be seen again. Just like Lamina\u2019s innocence. And even further beyond that, the specifics of Lamina\u2019s story strikes an excessively personal chord with Naoki. The bit where a young woman is taken against her will, \u201cused\u201d by men, and kept in deplorable conditions for the amusement of those with the power to do such things, specifically. Even though Naoki isn\u2019t usually one to be moved and motivated by emotions, this just rubs her in all of the wrong ways that she cannot even begin to articulate through the red haze.To such an extent, it would seem, to inspire Naoki to abruptly rise from her seat and move off to one of the room\u2019s windows. Standing rigidly before it and gazing out through it, Naoki holds one arm behind her back by grasping its wrist with the other hand. One might notice that the hand belonging to the arm being gripped is slowly changing color. If one might observe her reflection in the mirror, they might notice a small trickle of blood making its way down her chin from her lower lip. Additionally, her earring- her telepathy enabling gemstone, is uncharacteristically quiet, only shining slightly in the sunlight from the window. Naoki, too, is completely silent, save for the deep, shuddering breaths she seems to be forcing herself to take.  ", "1472336905000": "From the window, Naoki speaks- almost croaks, \u201cNo.\u201dA moment passes, during which Naoki licks the blood off her lip, bottles up her emotions, gathers her thoughts and turns about to face the pair of them. \u201cNo,\u201d she continues, more confidently, \u201cThe training will be delayed. It isn\u2019t a priority. Not in relation to the physical and mental well being of operatives. Ms. Manina is- as I assess, in no state to be training right now, and I sincerely doubt that she will be come tomorrow morning. She may meet Ms. Untyrid tomorrow, but her training will be postponed until such a time that she is fit to attend it.\u201dNaoki\u2019s tone of voice invites no argument and carries a touch of malice that isn\u2019t intended for either of either of the other women in the room. However, such questions as 'What will she do instead, then?' and, 'When will she be ready?' go unanswered by Naoki, at least for the moment. She seems to be contemplating something, however. ", "1472441792000": "Watching Lamina leave, Naoki raises a hand halfheartedly, as if to stop her, but declines to say anything or act further. After she does leave, Naoki turns back to the window, eyeing the buildings outside with the most furrowed of eyebrows. Her tail whips and lashes at random intervals. Not bothering to acknowledge what Takhana said, Naoki speaks, not exactly rudely, but curtly, and obviously with some level of difficulty. \u201cSee to it that she gets what she needs. Inform Emahra of how Lamina was mistreated, but tell her to be tactful about it, and attempt to give the pair assignments that are very visibly helping individuals. She needs to feel like she\u2019s doing something productive. Make sure that she is made aware of and regularly reminded of the fact that The Marshals are there to support her, and play up the personal aspect of it all. Overall, try to work things in such a way that she settles in well and has plenty to do and think about. She needs to move forward and begin a new stage in her life, and you\u2019re to see to see to it that it goes... well.\u201dHaving fumbled on her wording, Naoki spends another half moment to compose her thoughts before continuing, still not quite herself. On her temple, one vein in particular pulses furiously- indicative of her mood.\u201cSend a full copy of those notes to me once you\u2019re finished with them. Actually- send two copies. I\u2019m going to The Black Tower, and each and every single one of those bastards are going directly to hell. I\u2019ll be in touch.\u201dWith that, Naoki strides directly to the door, opens it, moves out, and shuts it firmly behind her- careful not to slam. Once outside the door, and not in anyone\u2019s direct scrutiny, Naoki takes a few moments to clear her mind before proceeding back to the entry hall, and the front desk. Having composed herself to at least a semi-reasonable degree, she approaches the desk and the woman sitting behind it, offering her a curt nod in greeting before immediately beginning, \u201cMs. Mortis? I\u2019m pleased to make your acquaintance. However, in lieu of small talk, I have one somewhat important question. Have you learned how to file orders to our furniture suppliers?\u201d", "1472473785000": "\u201cYes. You see that chair?\u201dWith one pointed arm, Naoki indicates one of the seats sitting off to the side off to one side. One of many intended for guests to wait in, the chair isn\u2019t anything particularly special, and was likely manufactured by a local carpenter. \u201cIf you would, please, order a replacement. Bill it to me directly. Thank you, and have a good remainder of your day.\u201d After offering Thaelyn a very obviously forced sort of grin, Naoki proceeds over to chair, grasps it by the back, and proceeds to abscond with it, off toward the stairs leading down into the basement- and the training rooms. About a half hour later, just after Naoki makes her departure, if one were to check the trash bin just outside the training facility, they would find it filled with charred splinters and a handful of ash. ", "1506563493000": "In the afternoon, just after lunch, Lady Naoki makes her entrance. She pushes the door wide in a single smooth movement and strides into the lobby as if she owns the place. She moves directly to address whoever may be at the desk, \u201cPardon me,\u201d she says, \u201cI\u2019d like to speak with Marshals Jun of the Celadine and Lamina Manira as soon as they\u2019re available. Could you arrange that?\u201d\u201cThank you,\u201d Naoki continues, without waiting for a response. \u201cI\u2019ll be\u2026 over here, in this room.\u201dLady Naoki then proceeds into the aforementioned room. It seems to be a sitting room of sorts, featuring some chairs, a table, and a tasteful chandelier. She selects one of the chairs, takes a moment to get situated, pulls a book from her coat, and begins to read.", "1507204211000": "Though she remains largely motionless as she\u2019s reading, Naoki\u2019s ears remain active, continually turning and angling themselves to maintain supreme auditory awareness. Different sets of feet passing by, doors opening and shutting down the hall, Marshals conversing. It\u2019s not a bad place to read, she thinks. However, at the sound of a knock, Naoki looks up to turn her attention to the door. \u201cCome in,\u201d she says. \u201cAh, Lamina.\u201d Naoki offers a polite smile and a wave inward. \u201cCome in, come in, have a seat.

Steepling her fingers, she challenges Lamina, \u201cGuess.\u201d", "1508216735000": "As she listens, Naoki\u2019s eyebrows raise. She isn\u2019t entirely sure what she was expecting, but Lamina goes right for the big stuff, doesn\u2019t she. Which, admittedly, she\u2019s right to, considering who she\u2019s speaking with, but even so - most people don\u2019t ask for the houses outright. \u201cMmmmmmmmhhhhhh\u2026\u201d Naoki trails off with a rising tone. \u201cYou\u2019ll see,\u201d she offers teasingly.\u201cYou\u2019ll see - after we\u2019re finished here. ... Unless you\u2019ve got something better planned.\u201d Another smirk, as if there was any possibility of that. ", "1508222577000": "\u201cWell,\u201d Naoki begins, seemingly pleased to be asked, \u201cThe short of it is such that I have things planned. Big things, dangerous things, for which I intend to enlist the assistance of Marshals.\u201d She explains this as\u201cI came with the intention to speak with you and with Jun of the Celadine about taking part in said endeavors. However. It\u2019s been a while now, and evidently, Jun does have better things to do, as she isn\u2019t here.\u201d With a breezy gesture, Naoki highlights the distinct lack of Jun in the room. Catching herself, Naoki pulls back a step and softens her tone. \u201cAnd, while I don\u2019t necessarily mean to imply that whatever she\u2019s doing is less important - she has many legitimate responsibilities I respect, I\u2019m also not going to wait around here all day.\u201d\u201cSo,\u201d she continues, \u201cI'm going to speak with you now before proceeding with the day, and meet with Jun another time. It\u2019s probably for the best to speak to you both individually in any case.\u201d", "1508257818000": "Opening her mouth, Naoki makes as if to speak but pauses. Shuts her mouth, opens it again, and hesitates, considering how best to word things. Apparently having decided, she begins, \u201c... Living in Medan and through any knowledge, you\u2019ve picked up after the fact, how much do you know about the legend called, \u2018The Gems of Coreria\u2019?\u201d", "1508292483000": "\u201cMhmh\u2026\u201d That sort of morbid, negative tone isn\u2019t precisely what Naoki would have liked to lead into the conversation with, but there isn\u2019t any stepping around it in this case.\u201cThe story goes such that once, where Meridian lies today, there was a kingdom called \u2018Croeria.' On the whole, it was wealthy and prosperous, due primarily to its usage of four exceedingly powerful gemstones. The magic users of Coreria were able to utilize the gems to do such things as enrich the soil, manipulate the weather to benefit their crops, and grant themselves amazing boons of nature. Merely possessing the gems also served to deter all but the most foolhardy of attackers.  In such a condition, Croeria thrived for an indeterminate but significant number of years.\u201d\u201cHowever,\" continues Naoki, \"It all fell to ruin very quickly when some manner of a catastrophe involving the gems occurred. I\u2019m inclined to think the catalyst was an attempted coup or corruption within the kingdom, but don\u2019t take my word on that. Suffice it to say that Croeria no longer exists. There are survivors, the most notable of whom is our own Duchess Camilla; there are probably other, some artifacts, and perhaps ruins, though I\u2019m not qualified to speak to the extent of those.\u201d", "1508296830000": "Naoki shakes her head. \u201cNot quite.\u201d \u201cWe were able to recover the gem the Goraians were using without incident - that was the gem associated with fire. Later, we found that the earth and water gems were quite close by, and relatively easy to obtain, meaning that we now possess those three out of the four,\u201d Naoki explains, skipping right over the portion of the story in which the gems had been hidden to prevent further misuse, as well as the part where both had been acquired through deals wherein noncompliance would have been detrimental to their guardians\u2019 continued state of living.Maintaining her momentum, Naoki continues, \u201cAaand, very soon, within the next few days, we will discover the location of the fourth.\u201d", "1508351482000": "Naoki tilts her head to one side and raises an eyebrow. \u201c...n-Noooo\u2026?\u201dShe shakes her head. \u201cI\u2019m afraid not.

Jun still hasn\u2019t quite gotten the hang of it, the whole telepathy thing. Her technique is sloppy. In the past it\u2019s been interesting and often amusing, to have a brief look at Jun\u2019s thought processes. In this case, Naoki finds it less amusing and more\u2026 concerning, perhaps.Naoki offers no reply. To do so would likely prove distracting and by extension hazardous, though Jun does receive a wish of good luck.But in a more immediate sense, Naoki is having a conversation. Despite the distraction, she\u2019s able to follow reasonably well and evidently finds what Lamina has to say amusing, chuckling a bit to herself. \u201cWell\u2026 We\u2019ll have to see about that another day,\u201d Naoki says, with that same teasing inflection.\u201cBut-!\u201d She continues, still focused on the topic, \u201cIt goes such that the four combined are stronger than the sum of them all, and considering how strong even just one is\u2026 I believe all four would equate to power the likes of which has never been seen in The Overworld post-cataclysm.\u201dA pause for effect.\u201cOr the Hellscape,\u201d she adds as an afterthought. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s so very, very, very important that it is we that obtain the fourth gem, as opposed to any other party.\u201d", "1508602934000": "\u201cAnd I\u2019d like you to be there when we go to get it,\u201d Naoki clarifies. \u201cIt\u2019s almost certainly going to take time to take the gem from wherever it\u2019s hidden, and I suspect that during that time, we will be attacked by others who would see themselves with it. Who, I can\u2019t say. Anyone both greedy and foolish enough. Without knowing the location or the potential aggressors, I can only plan but so much, but it\u2019s my thought that when the time comes, having you around would be for the better.\u201d", "1508633605000": "At Lamina\u2019s mention of a favor, Naoki quirks an eyebrow.

Moving quickly is easy, getting to it shouldn\u2019t prove an issue. Rather, the issue lies in the fact that when the ritual reveals the location, it will be revealed to everyone. Very visibly. Most probably involving a lightshow of some sort.\u201d\u201cSo it will be a matter of securing it against who, or whatever comes to take it. ... To try to take it,\u201d Naoki corrects herself.", "1509680615000": "\u201cExcellent.\u201d Pleased to have that out of the way, Naoki clasps her hands together and stands. \u201cNow, unless you have any other business here, I think we can move forward.

The details are unimportant.\u201cI\u2019ll be outside.\u201dToday\u2019s carriage is, relative to other options, somewhat mundane. Not the armored beast used for long-distance travel, not the Royal Carriage with its frills, but just a carriage.

What is it that you\u2019ve uncovered?\u201d", "1460962656000": "There is a brief pause as Naoki digests the information and forms her stance.\u201cWell, the first thing I would like to suggest is that you be very cautious when approaching this matter in any way. Simply because a being is feeling despair and anger does not necessarily mean that they are a good person, or aren\u2019t dangerous. I advise you not to be quite as quick as you seem to be about forming feelings over a being you have so little information about.\u201d\u201cAdditionally, this seems highly suspicious to me, even beyond the possibility of the\u00a0individual\u00a0in question being... unsavory. Some location, off deep in the mountains, protected by something that prevents you from discerning the full extent of the situation, and going on about \u2018letting something in\u2019? Either the one you made contact with, or whatever he\u2019s referring to could be attempting to fool you. I\u2019m not quite sure how, but it seems like an excellent setup for some manner of trap. I wouldn\u2019t put it above some sorts to lay such a devious snare as that, or play on your emotions as bait.\u201d\u201cHowever, I'll be the first to admit, I may just be being cynical, here. It\u2019s entirely possible that what you saw may be nothing more than it seems to be, and there is actually a group trapped in there. For that reason, I\u2019ll support an investigation. An investigation taken with all due caution, but an investigation nonetheless. Based on your information, who would you most prefer to take or direct on this venture?\u201d", "1460965508000": "\u201cOh, that\u2019s an excellent idea. Drude will be able to travel there essentially instantaneously, and is probably above the effects of whatever hostile magics may be in play or used in a trap.

He does not currently have another assignment, so feel free to direct him to pursue this matter further however you see fit. Once we\u2019ve at least established that it isn\u2019t an obvious or easily sprung trap- if that turns out to be the case, you would have my acquiescence to lead or direct another team over there for a more thorough investigation, though I will still insist that you exercise all due caution. Though the best traps are the ones that aren\u2019t obvious, this still seems like a ploy of some sort. ...

Be cautious. You know that this is a dangerous situation already, before you\u2019ve even left. Give the danger the respect it deserves, and don\u2019t make any decisions rashly. There is a significant possibility that this situation is outside of your capabilities to handle safely.

Following behind her are the other members of The Midnight Sun who would be attending the funeral, including but not limited to Artemis and Mr. Cresno.The procession makes its way to the gates of the graveyard, and proceeds inside. The wagon stops at a freshly dug grave, and the coffin is lowered out of the wagon to rest on the grass beside the hole, opposite the mound of dirt that would cover it.The small group circles around the grave silently, and stands motionless, waiting for others to arrive and then for Mr. Cresno to begin the eulogy.

Something about all of the things they had done, or how instrumental Hasdrubal had been in the formation of The Midnight Sun. How many people would never again taste Hasdrubal\u2019s signature Heartbreak.Disregarding the expectations, Naoki decided not to say anything.

Paul was one of the newer bouncers, she was never made aware of his past with Hasdrubal. Disgust, then realization, back to disbelief. Naoki was sparing no expense when it came to exaggerated facial expressions. Naoki lifts her veil with one hand, and narrows her eyes to squint at \u2018Paul\u2019. There was no way. No way... There it was. That stupid grin. Another kaleidoscope of emotion. Except this time, the die landed on \u2018anger\u2019. How dare he. There was a fine line between practical jokes and leading everyone to believe you were dead for a whole week. A line, that in Naoki\u2019s mind, should be respected. Discarding her air of mournful contemplation, she marches right over to Hasdrubal, dirtying the hem of her dress in the dirt around the freshly dug grave. Standing face to face, she takes another look at this face. It was still there, that stupid grin. Madame Naoki beings trembling, her eyebrows screwing together, fists balling up. She struggles to find words.\u201cYou\u2026 you\u2026 IDIOT.\u201dWith the last word, Naoki winds up, and sends her gloved fist flying toward Hasdrubal\u2019s faceplate in a terrible haymaker.

Artemis, Ryden Greyiron, and two of The Citadel\u2019s honor guard follow closely behind. As she proceeds, she takes stock of the situation in the plaza. It seems as if the majority of the troublemakers have dispersed, and the mages from The Enclave have essentially controlled the flames. Only a few mages remain to quell the embers of the fires, and some have even begun removing the soot that cakes the otherwise relatively clean paving stones. Additionally, the majority of the guards stationed around the perimeter of the square remain. \u201cIf I had known I would be rooting out corruption and stepping through soot today, I wouldn\u2019t have worn my favorite cardigan\u2026\u201d she muses. However, as she steps slowly through the square, examining the damages and making note of which areas would require more than simply a cleaning, only a very minimal amount of debris sees it fit to attach itself to her person. After a few moments of simply observing, she turns to Ryden, and makes a rather pointed inquiry. \u201cWould you please point out some of the guards who stood idly by and watched this transpire?\u201d Her voice is again, sharp, but not wrathful.", "1462442451000": "\u201cHm. I would have liked to have a talk with some of them. I can be quite persuasive, you know.\" She glances slide long at Ryden, and waggles her eyebrows slightly. What exactly she's getting at is left open to interpretation.\"If you can\u2019t point them out though, fair enough. It is awfully dark; I can\u2019t fault you for that. What have you got in mind?\u201dAs she speaks, her brow remains furrowed, lower lip raised in something of a pout. Lack of discipline within her own ranks isn\u2019t a concept with which she has had much experience. A fact which is mostly true due to the very personal nature of her older contacts. Having hired them all in person, and had the opportunity to weed out the weak sorts at the root, all of Madame Naoki\u2019s employees at The Midnight Sun have only the highest degrees of loyalty, relative to these traitorous worms gathering before her now.With one hand, she reaches into the black pouch on her hip, and extracts a small citrine marble, which begins to glow slightly with yellow light in her closed fist.\u00a0", "1462449127000": "The marble clutched in Naoki\u2019s fist glows more and more brightly. The light filtering through her fingers- tinted to an orangeish sort of pink by her skin, functions as a sort of lamp. She holds her glowing fist above her head, garnering the attention of the group of guards. Shadows play across her face-  her asymmetrical bangs casting the left side of her face into darkness. Instead of responding to Ryden, she speaks up, and addresses the guards with the same steel-edged voice she had used previously. \u201cThis is Sir Greyrion!\u201dWith her right hand, she presents Ryden, inviting him to take a step forward.\u201cHe is the new head of the guard, effective immediately. He has a letter, notarized by yours truly, that confirms this. In light of the recent failures here, he will be changing some things around. You all- and the rest of the guard- are to follow his orders and cooperate with him however possible. There will be no firing- and no hiring, or staffing changes of any sort unless either I or Sir Greyiron approve it. If any of you- or anyone else, have a problem with anything that I just said, or with Sir Greyiron or his orders, a question about the changes, a complaint to lodge, or any other conundrum related to the matter at hand, you are to come see me, in my office. Likewise, do not prevent or discourage any of your fellows from coming to see me. Such behavior would be a capital offense! Any questions?\u201dThe hardness of her tone leaves no room for questions. Some of the men shift uneasily on their feet, others maintain eye contact with Naoki for the duration of her speech. One guard even salutes, but no questions are raised. Her own eyes make careful note of these reactions, storing away the information for later. \u201cGood. Thank you, gentlemen.\u201dShe nods sharply once in the direction of the group of the assembled guard, before turning abruptly about to face Ryden. The sharp features of her face soften, and her debatably harsh tone of voice is gone, to be replaced with a pleasant whisper. \u201cDon\u2019t try to placate me, Greyiron. If I were not already the master of myself and my emotions, I wouldn\u2019t be in the position I am today. Look at the way the guards are acting. You see that older man on the far right; the short one with the goatee and the captain's stripe? He\u2019s one of the more senior captains- I\u2019ve seen him around. You see the way he looks at the younger captain standing to his immediate right? You see that contempt in his eyes? I would be willing to bet- and indeed, I do! I bet you five gold coins that the younger captain was not here when the events transpired, and the older one was, doing his best to stop things. He resents the younger one for leaving, and is himself loyal. My face is as much a tool as your sword, Greyiron, and I wield it as such. Use your methods to rectify this situation, but realize that my own are often quite effective- especially so when dealing with interpersonal problems such as these. If any of them give you trouble, send them my way, and come up yourself when you\u2019re done.\u201dWith that said, Madame Naoki nods once in farewell to Ryden, beckons for Second Lieutenant Calgary to follow her,\u00a0and begins to walk back toward the steps leading back up into the Citadel, Artemis always at her side. The honor guard remain, standing at ease behind Ryden, awaiting orders.", "1462450810000": "As Second Lieutenant Calgary approaches, Naoki pauses in her stride, and turns to face him. She listens as he delivers his report, and mulls the information over for a few moments before responding. \u201cDon\u2019t bother trying to seal that street off; it\u2019s infeasible. Not only are there likely hidden passages and the like, and not only is it the dead of night, but doing that sort of thing may alarm the citizenry with no real benefit. We know who the perpetrators were, and we know where they live. Stopping them from getting home can only escalate the situation further. I don\u2019t want this to lead to a bloodbath- the street is red enough without blood on it.\u201d \u201cHowever, if you can positively identify an individual- even one, who was involved in the burning here, arrest them. Be cautious, obviously. The suspect is, by definition, a pyromancer, but if your men are able to get me an interrogation target, that would be immensely beneficial, but do not risk any lives to do it. One Dawn Rider is more valuable than ten delinquents to interrogate. If you can\u2019t successfully apprehend an individual who was involved- don\u2019t bother. This is not a high enough priority objective to spend lives on it.\u201dShe turns to gaze behind Calgary, to the plaza, and assesses the state of things. \u201cThe situation here seems stable enough to me. After you\u2019ve had those orders relayed, you could stick around the Plaza here to ensure things remain that way, but I don\u2019t expect any more trouble tonight.  If your company manages to arrest any of the perpetrators, have them taken  to the dungeon, cuffed with magic-inhibiting restraints, and notify me immediately. Beyond that, defer to the orders of Captain Aurelius and Sir Greyiron, and make sure that I am informed if anything of note transpires. Thank you, Second Lieutenant .\u201dShe nods to Calgary, indicating that she is finished speaking, and unless he has anything further to say, he is dismissed. ", "1462492984000": "Seeing as how this has been escalated into combat, turn order becomes a thing that matters. If all involved could please start allowing that to happen, that would be swell. This means that this scene is going to take much longer, but that\u2019s what escalating things to combat means. Rather than a strict order, I figure we can probably just do it such that everyone on Team Isra gets to post once in between every post of Attla\u2019s, in whatever order they can. At present, this list includes Naoki, Artemis, Jun, Dawn Riders, Ryden, and Isra itself (representing\u00a0The Citadel and such).Madame Naoki stands her ground at the foot of The Citadel\u2019s step as events begin to transpire. What the actual what. What. Who is this. Who are they referring to. Who the hell is \u201cGlavlidom\u201d. Yet another self-declared dragon god, apparently. Swell. Absolutely fantastic. Nothing better, in Naoki\u2019s book. She wasn\u2019t looking to finish any of that paperwork or go home relatively early tonight and spend some quality time with Kate. Not at all! Clearly not, she would much rather spend her time here, dealing with egotistical fire dragons. In a great huff of genuine and unmasked irritation, Madame Naoki turns and begins to swiftly ascend the steps of The Citadel. She knows her place, and it is not on a battlefield. Best to step back and allow her professionals to handle this. Her presence would only further complicate matters by splitting the attention of her combatants.However, it is her task to direct the battle, and summon reinforcements. To this end, her earring begins to glow with unbridled luminosity. Both to mask this luminosity and protect her sensitive ears from that terrible din, Naoki places her hands carefully on her head, covering her ears.First, Naoki reaches out telepathically to Jun of the Celadine . Conveniently enough, she finds that Jun is already in the immediate vicinity, and preparing to take action. A step ahead, brilliant. Naoki issues some tactical instructions to Jun. Next, she reaches out to Lum'Valia , The Black Tower , and Xel'rath , just for starters. She requests that Lum and Xel\u2019 make their way to the site of the conflict, and requests that The Black Tower begin to prepare to take offensive action against this transgressor.

As soon as his presence manifested in the clearing and started channeling magic, the others would be able to notice immediately as a greedy pull on the local area's magic could be felt.\u00a0Xel'rath would look towards the table as he channeled his energy, his form's expression emotionless, \"It seems I am late,\" he said offhandedly. Almost immediately, Attla would, if he was capable, notice a pressure begin to gather on his mind. Unnoticeable at first but growing by the moment as Xel'rath seeked to infiltrate it and read his thoughts. At the same moment he would mentally message Naoki.I have arrived, I advise the best course of action to be to terminate the threat here and now. Chances of a reappearance of this particular threat would be 0% in such a scenario.The telepathic response from within The Citadel comes swiftly, and is relayed not only to\u00a0Xel'rath, but each of Naoki's associates around the table.\"I know; to simply eliminate this cretin now would arguably be the course of action. But bear in mind the setting. If each of you give it all you have to erase this scum from the face of this world, there will be fallout for miles around and permanent damage to the city. If at all possible, I'd like to avoid that. If it can be persuaded to leave, that would be\u00a0infinitely preferable.

Let's hear what it has to say before we take action.\"", "1469088172000": "On the morning following the most recent Assembly meeting, Lady Naoki makes her way down from The Citadel into the central plaza. On this morning- which shows signs of rain, but has yet to deliver, Naoki is wearing, as she tends to, a loose white blouse and some fine, but otherwise unobtrusive black trousers. Her pouch of gemstones hangs from one hip, and Artemis follows just slightly behind. Naoki strides purposefully, but not necessarily enthusiastically. Today would be the first day of implementing her new policies. But such things exist in parallel with her other responsibilities, and will be indirectly eating into what would otherwise be her free time. Still. It has to be done. Having made her way properly into the plaza, Naoki spends a moment to survey her surroundings. Things seem to be proceeding just about as they tend to, in the Central Plaza in the morning. Commuting workers shuffle along the promenades, headed for their respective workplaces. The merchants have already finished setting up their stalls for the day, and are now proceeding to push their goods on any passerby who dare to make eye contact. Advertisements are nailed not only to the notice boards intended for such things, but also to benches, walls, pillars, and anything else at eye level. The majority of the advertisements are new, since the last time Naoki looked. A pair of guards have broken away from their post, and are attempting to remedy the issue, removing advertisements outside of the designated areas, but they don\u2019t seem to have made much progress. The lapping of water in the fountain is entirely drowned out by the drifting conversations of the plaza\u2019s occupants. Angling her ears just so, Naoki is able to pick out a few snippets of conversation, and she stand motionless, listening for a few moments. There doesn\u2019t seem to be anything of any particular note to be heard, though. Simply people, going about their business. And here, a small pang of pride hits Naoki. Here are people. Her people. Going about their business; in her city. Happily, for the most part. One young man waves nervously, and Naoki returns a wink, running her tongue across her upper lip before returning to surveying the crowd at large. It\u2019s been a fair few months since she\u2019s been elected; and the city hasn\u2019t burnt down yet. Naoki isn\u2019t one for superstition, but Isra\u2019s continued existence under her leadership must be some manner of miracle. Even so, it\u2019s a rather fulfilling feeling. Seeing all the little people puttering about and earning money to be taxed. But standing about, people-watching isn\u2019t quite what Naoki came here to do. Meandering over to one side of the plaza, Naoki selects a bench. Made of carved marble, one of many, and not even so much as distinguishable from the one next to it, save for the fact that this one sits in the sun, and is therefore significantly warmer to sit on. Having selected the bench, Naoki seats herself upon it with all due care, smoothing out her blouse once seated. Now seated upon the bench, she proceeds to sit. Apparently waiting for someone, or something. She drapes one arm across the back of the bench, and adjusts her posture just so as to seem approachable. ", "1471152195000": "Click. Hearing approaching from behind, Naoki\u2019s ears swivel to train themselves on the source. Click. Ah. Click. Here she comes.As Grandma approaches and seats herself, Naoki nods once, nonchalantly.

No major political opponents have yet presented themselves, and things are quiet on the international stage. For all intents and purposes, everything is proceeding smoothly.\u201d\u201cHowever, with that in mind, there isn\u2019t much of particular importance to be done at present. Nothing you\u2019d find interesting, at least. Mostly paperwork.\u201d Naoki trails off for a moment, considering. \u201cHowever, there is one thing. I\u2019d like to have a mount. Something\u2026 appropriate.\u201d She pauses for a moment, applying the correct amount of emphasis. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t quite scour the lands searching. I\u2019m required here.

But not giving Grandma the resources she needs to operate properly would be a poorer decision, so Naoki nods, agreeing to the request.\u201cThe easiest way to do that would be to instate you as a special Sun Marshal, I think. Rather than creating a new position and having to explain it to everyone on a case by case basis. I\u2019ll have someone provide you with the badge and scarf later today.\u201d\u201cWe have built a forge, yes. The Forge; if I might be so bold.

Sure enough, one of Dawnfire Forge\u2019s crystal support pylons is visible, stretching up to disappear behind The Citadel.\u201cI\u2019m surprised you didn\u2019t see it on the way in, really. But it\u2019s very good, yes. In addition to the primary Sunmetal forge, an innumerable horde of private blacksmiths and craftsmen have set up in the complex. Whatever one might require, it can be made there.\u201dFor a moment, Naoki simply sits, still contemplating what else might need doing that Grandma might be well suited to do. After a moment or so, a soft, \u2018ah\u2019 indicates that she\u2019s remembered something. \u201cOne thing you might consider- we have a prisoner. An ancient dragon of some sort. They caused a massive disturbance and very nearly destroyed this plaza we\u2019re sitting in. However, we were able to subdue him and transport them down into The Cube. However, strange magics surround the dragon, making it dangerous to approach. But strange magics hardly faze you, do they.\u201dWith that statement, Naoki tilts her head to one side and breaks out one of her smirks. Grandma is very nearly the definition of strange magics, after all.

Once again, for what seems like the hundredth time, Naoki finds herself pleased to be aligned with that entity- that entity which goes by the name \u2018Grandma\u2019. It isn\u2019t Naoki- but rather, her enemies that must fear that name. However, it\u2019s always rather unnerving to speak with the \u201cwoman\u201d. A residual shiver works its way down Naoki\u2019s spine and out through her tail. Something about them- something about the facade is imperfect. Perhaps it's the eyes. Or the way she moves. It's hard to say.Regardless, Naoki\u2019s train of thought soon leaves Grandma behind on the track to other things. Wider scale things. For another hour or so, Naoki sits in the square, observing, thinking, and trying her very best to tan.

For this most auspicious of occasions, she seems to have chosen to wear her recently acquired armor, a fully plated, dusky orange sort of affair with Isra\u2019s insignia emblazoned across the chest in silver.As she begins to move forward, out of the shadow of the gate and into the light and full view of all those assembled in the square below, the armor gleams. As she proceeds down the stairs, it clinks and clanks, as plated armor tends to, though it seems awfully loud to her.After a longer walk down the stairs than Naoki really would have preferred to keep up her dramatic timing, she arrives at the stage/platform and steps up onto it. It creaks a bit under her weight, and she reflects in passing that it certainly would be a spectacle for her to go tumbling down the remainder of the stairs in a mess of shattered wood, metal armor, and tail, but doesn\u2019t stop. Instead, she steps directly up onto the podium and proceeds to clear her throat.\u201cHe-hem.\u201dThe sound reverberates throughout the square and the city, evidently amplified by some trick of magic. However, it\u2019s a bit on the loud side, causing even Naoki to wince a bit at the sound of her own voice.After a moment, she tries again, \u201cHe-hem.\u201dThis time, the volume is somewhat more reasonable, only loud enough to be clearly heard, but not quite loud enough to screech. Nodding to herself- evidently satisfied, Naoki proceeds with her address, \u201cPeople of Isra. For long, we have heard of the atrocities committed by Goraia. We have heard of their bloody coup, the murder of Hylon Emarae, and the events that followed. It was a year ago, now, that their reign of tyranny and oppression began. Since then, they have imprisoned, enslaved, and brutally mistreated Medanese citizens day after day. Now we know that these evils have not stopped within their own borders. They are raping, murdering, and torching lands that never belonged to them!\u201dWith each clause, the tempo and passion of Naoki\u2019s voice increases, building toward a crescendo. Additionally, she begins to gesticulate wildly with one hand, waving it about emphatically in time with her words.\u201cThere are those who stand among us even now who, while fortunate enough to have successfully escaped, have witnessed Goraian cruelty firsthand! There are those who stand among us at this moment who have lost their mothers, brothers, fathers, and children to the malicious and uncaring Goraian steel or prison camps. There are they who know the relentless grip of tyranny first hand.\u201dHere, she pauses for the space of a moment, her gesticulating hand frozen in place, one finger pointed straight up.\u201cBut I say this. No longer!\u201d With this, she slams the gesticulating hand down upon the surface of the podium. This causes the whole rickety affair to jump slightly under her feet with the force of the blow, threatening to collapse and send her careening down the steps. She makes a mental note to avoid doing that again.Repeating herself more clearly, she continues, \u201cNo longer. Isra will not allow such atrocities to be committed- both to a nation that was once our ally- nor to anyone who is a part of the free world. Isra was founded under the auspicious principles of freedom, democracy, and the rights of all to enjoy life peacefully. Under those ideals, we have grown strong. And while it may be unreasonable to expect the whole world to adopt such ideals as their own, it is unacceptable for any group- regardless of its status, affiliation, or supposed justification, to do what Goraia has done and not expect retribution. We cry out for the voiceless, for the meek and lowly who cannot speak out for themselves. We care for the enslaved, for the widow and orphan, when no one else will. We fight for the weak.\u201dHere, she pauses for the space of a moment, allowing her words to resonate and reverberate before continuing,\u00a0\u201cAnd so, where the people of Medan cannot stand up against the oppressors, I tell you today that Isra will. I, High Lady Naoki, on behalf of the sovereign state of Isra, do hereby declare war on Goraia. Their mistreatment of their own citizenry has persisted for far too long. We turn to war as the final means of liberation for these oppressed, and the utter removal of a power so cancerous to the world stage. The rulers of Goraia have shown they will not live in the light, and so they must be relegated to the darkness that they love so much. If we tolerate such a power for even one more day, then we are directly complicit with their heinous acts. We who love so dearly our own freedoms must share them with the world. If we clutch at them as pearls, holding them above and beyond the rest of the world, then how can we say Isra is a force for good?\u201d", "1490048720000": "[The day immediately following the Seven-Day-War, at noon.]Just before the appropriate time, Lady Naoki exits The Citadel via the unreasonably large, seldom-used gate facing the Central Plaza. None stand at her side. Today is not the day that begins any fanfare, nor the use of heralds, so Lady Naoki just proceeds down the stairs briskly, yet with the appropriate amount of grace. On this occasion, she wears a red, double-breasted jacket bearing the Sun Insignia with tall black boots. While not the outfit she wore to command any battle, it seems like one that could use for such a thing, which is the intention. Upon reaching the platform where the podium sits, Naoki turns to one side to clear her throat and tuck a portion of her hair behind one ear before stepping up onto the rostrum, and into the effective range of the phonic-amplification runes places therein.\u201cPeople of Isra,\u201d Naoki begins, her voice ringing out loud and clear over the plaza, as well as a good portion of the city. \u201cAllow me to inform you without any further preamble that the Goraian regime has been torn asunder. Annihilated.\u201d  Naoki punctuates this statement firmly, planting her fist on the surface of the podium.Regardless of if she had planned to or not, Naoki is forced to pause her speech here. The conflict against the tyrannical Goraian regime has been framed as a necessary and righteous battle, and as such, the people of Isra are quite pleased to hear that it has been won, and have erupted in cheers. However, sprinkled among them are some murmurs of disbelief. The armies only left last week. Accounting for travel, that hardly leaves any time for fighting, much less a decisive victory. Some are suspicious, untrusting. Others, stunned, amazed by the feat.Lady Naoki adopts a carefully practiced expression that manages to convey slightly smug patriotism and waits for a few moments before beginning to speak again. \u201cThe battle was short and thankfully not nearly as costly as it could have been. As our forces were traveling to Medan, Goraian command figures deserted their posts to flee, leaving a headless army which promptly surrendered. At this moment, The First Legion is occupying New Brimiarde, and The Second Legion, Stonevale. The Gorarian army in both locations has been disarmed, and very little blood has been shed. While some of their leaders may still be at large, Medan is free.\u201dAnother round of cheers, though not quite as loud as the first. While none can deny that the victory is cause for celebration, the idea that those responsible have eluded justice is a discomforting thought. \"However, our work in Medan is not yet complete. Though we have disbanded the majority of its army, we must be thorough, eliminate all remaining Goraian forces, and take all assets of theirs to ensure that they do not return. Further, we must establish a new government in Medan, and protect the people of Medan during this time of transition. As such, the Legion will remain deployed for some time yet to keep the peace, as Medan is still very much in a state of martial law. News regarding this matter will follow in the coming months in the form of announcements delivered here in the plaza. Consider the state closed to tourism until otherwise indicated. Thank you.\"With this, Lady Naoki raises one hand, displaying her palm to the crowd and waving a bit, before turning about and heading back up the stairs, and into The Citadel. ", "1500495365000": "Having waited quite long enough for a crowd to assemble, Lady Naoki decides that the time has come to announce her quest. For this appearance- public as it is, she had chosen to wear a little black dress whose modesty is preserved only by a sort of red cape worn about her waist. As The Empress steps up into view of the crowd it becomes quiet, conversations paused. She pauses to look over the crowd. Hm. Not as many as she had hoped for, Naoki thinks. No one she recognizes as significant, most of these are mere bounty hunters. But it will have to do for today. Raising her voice to an appropriate and regal level, she begins to speak. \u201cCitizens. Travelers. Today I present a Quest, which is as follows. It is a task of retrieval. There is an object, multiple objects, out in the world that I wish to possess. Whosoever brings it to me will be rewarded justly.\u201d\u201cThe object appears as a boulder. A strangely colored boulder that has fallen from the sky- a meteorite. It is likely in multiple pieces, many rocks, and any portion of it is valid for the purpose of this quest. As I will pay five times the weight of any given piece in gold.\u201dHere, Lady Naoki pauses as murmurs spread through the crowd. Five boulder\u2019s worth of gold is an awful lot. An incredible fortune, even a tenth of that would set someone for life.\u201cAdditionally,\u201d Naoki continues, \u201cTo those who may bring particularly large or interesting portions, I will reward. \u2026 Favors.\u201dAnother ripple of murmurs, louder. Dirty jokes are cracked by those who think she can\u2019t hear them. Atop the pedestal, Naoki scoffs once and smirks, amused. She then continues, raising one finger, \u201cBut! I don\u2019t intend to send anyone searching the far corners of the earth; I know where it is.\u201d With a smug smile, She produces a small, circular bit of metal from some pocket and holds it up to the crowd. \u201cBy means of this compass, I know that the prize is within the Eastern Forest.\u201d She pauses. \u201cThe deep portion of the Forest.\u201dA few groans, a few curses by men who realize themselves to have no chance. The depths of the Eastern Forest are known to be more than simply dangerous. Tales of beasts in the forest are told to children, stories of walking trees and spiders the size of horses. Some of it is doubtless an exaggeration, but some truth is behind all tales of that sort, and this is proven to an extent by the fact that many have never come back from forays into the dark woods. Few try.\u201cNeedless to say, groups of soldiers have no place in the deep wood, hence my Quest. To any who intend to attempt the venture, I will provide with a compass like this, such that it may guide them to the prize. I now ask that all who intend to take this quest form an orderly, single file line, such so that they may receive one.\u201dWith a regal gesture, Naoki indicates the ground just before her on the pedestal- where she would like the line to start. As the crowd begins to move, she raises her voice slightly to add, \u201cThis quest will be ongoing until such a point as I close it, and additional compasses may be obtained here until that point.\u201dAfter this line has been formed- perhaps twenty-five long, The Empress concludes her address. \u201cThat is all. Any with questions may stay.\u201d She offers the crowd a nod- a dismissal before herself turning and proceeding back down the stairs.", "1500750326000": "A page sitting at a box distributes the compasses. As prospective adventurers approach, he offers one from his hand. A few paces behind him, The Empress stands with hands held behind her back. As each receives their compass, she eyes them, seemingly assessing. There still aren\u2019t as quite as many as she had hoped for, and among the group, none stand out as particularly capable. It\u2019s a sobering thought that many of these people will never return from the forest, she thinks. There\u2019s a touch of guilt attached. Though not ordering them, she is incentivizing these to risk their lives knowingly. It remains their choice to do, but\u2026 It\u2019s not any worse than operating an army, she supposes, and the reward is fair. Justifying it as such, she pushes the matter from her mind.She remains in place as the line finishes and the adventurers begin to disperse. Should any wish to approach they would be free to do so under the watchful eyes of the Sentinels. The compasses themselves seem virtually identical, save for the number engraved on the back. The first in line received #1, the second #2, and so on. Each one is circular, perhaps three inches across, and seemingly made of brass. Beneath the glass, there is a painted backdrop of the night sky, atop which a delicate pointer sits. One would surely notice in utilizing a compass; it takes more than a full minute for the hand to come to a stop- more if it\u2019s jostled. The compass must remain perfectly still for a full minute to get an accurate reading.At this point, the compasses point east, toward the forest.", "1501022409000": "Looking on, Lady Naoki watches as groups begin to form. Some decline, and leave themselves. It\u2019s difficult to tell who\u2019s being foolish, but it seems as if there are at least a few here who have their heads on straight. Speaking of, there\u2019s Arya. As she comes and goes, Naoki smiles warmly but draw any more attention to Arya than that, figuring she\u2019ll approach if she should so desire.Interesting seeing her here, Naoki thinks. Perhaps she thought the Quest might have been some manner of noble deed within the scope of her activities. Hardly is, though. Not even a task that\u2019s important to be done in a larger sense. Perhaps Arya\u2019s doing it for her, Naoki thinks. \u2026 No, surely not, not this. It wouldn\u2019t make sense; the danger is too great. What if something happens? That would be terrible and feel worse, having sent her. But if she\u2019s captured\u2026 Images of great red beams carving through a forest set aflame come and go through Naoki\u2019s mind\u2019s eye. She huffs. Turning subtly, The Empress looks in an attempt to see if that bracelet with the purple stone is present. It may have been lost.", "1513142911000": "The stage is set and the time is right. The yule log is in place, the barriers are erected, and the crowd is assembled. People begin to murmur as the sun \u2014 clouded over as it is, starts to dip past the horizon. They\u2019re impatient, and rightfully so, because it\u2019s damn cold outside. They would quite like to get this over with and get back inside, somewhere warm.Standing at the base of the yule log, Lady Naoki feels much the same way. She\u2019s never one for the cold, and today is no exception. For this reason, she has chosen to wear one of her larger red coats \u2014 the double-breasted sort, with a high collar and appropriately regal trimmings. She\u2019s paired this with an overly-long gray scarf that Grandma    knit, the ends of which flap brazenly in the wind.A set of stairs has been hastily erected against the side of the log\u2019s enclosure. Though it appears far from sturdy \u2014 as seems to be the trend with such constructions, it ought to be enough to fulfill its purpose tonight. At least, that\u2019s what Lady Naoki hopes as she begins to ascend.With each step she takes, increasing numbers of eyes turn to look; a hush falls over the crowd. The fact presents itself: The Empress has chosen not to wear anything resembling pants.This stylistic choice is widely appreciated throughout the crowd, and by the time she\u2019s reached the top, The Empress has their effectively undivided attention. For three beats, all is silent, and the wind gusts a bit. (Much to everyone\u2019s excitement.) Then she begins.\u201cPeople of Isra!\u201d Her voice rings out clearly through the wind \u2014 courtesy of some magical trickery. \u201cFriends! Neighbors! Citizens! Visitors! Strangers!\u201d With each word, Naoki waves her torch in large arcs, pointing it at seemingly random portions of the crowd. \u201cWelcome, to the First Annual Yuletide Celebration! The beginning of a tradition!\u201d \u201cAs pre-cataclysm history goes, something called the Yuletide was once celebrated across the world; it was a time of peace and merry-making. Sources differ on the themes behind the holiday, but common are these: charity, feasting, fertility, and the celebration of successes and good harvests.\u201d\u201cIn the time since Isra\u2019s founding, we have found much success. While other nations falter and collapse under the pressures of poor leadership and lack of direction, we have stood strong! From nothing, we have built an entire Empire, where no one goes hungry, and all are free from the shackles of oppression!  We have grown, we have prospered, and today, we stand proudly as the greatest power in the land!\u201d\u201cSo, as these winter months set in, I say, why not? Why not celebrate, as they once did long ago? Let us now take some days to rest on our laurels! To give unto those less fortunate and those dear to us! Let us feast; let us drink! Let us love, and ensure many strong generations to follow!\u201d\u201cAnd finally, let us celebrate. Let us celebrate what we have accomplished and what is yet to come -- those closest to our hearts and our most far-flung countrymen! To Isra! And all that is good in this world!\u201dWith a suitably theatrical movement, The Empress hurls the torch over the wall.The effect is immediate.There is an audible roar as the fire spreads the entire length, and instantly consumes the log. It blazes some fifty feet up in the air. Along with fire comes the heat, a great big wave of it, washing out across the plaza. Some hats in the first few rows of the crowd are blown off, and poor Naoki is very nearly knocked off her platform.", "1513540997000": "After giving her speech, Lady Naoki descends back down to street-level and moves off to one side with her posse. She finds the light show to be a pleasure to watch; the Land Tillers do not fail to impress. Looking around The Plaza, Naoki notes with some satisfaction that attendance seems good. The presence of the Land Tiller leaders and Lum'Valia add much to the atmosphere and the image of the event, though she doubts many in the crowd know exactly who Lum is.Though the option of going home for a nap is enticing and is seriously considered, Lady Naoki has things she\u2019d like to get done. Namely, gift-giving and fraternizing with the populace. This is an excellent opportunity to build a good image.To that end, she wades out into the crowd and begins to meander her way around the Plaza. She does so closely followed by a set of Imperial Sentinels and likely Grandma but does so regardless. Though she\u2019s aware of the potential intimidation factor that comes along with big guys with plate armor and maces, she figures someone has to be bold  \u2014 or drunk enough, to approach.", "1513702616000": "The sound of someone speaking just behind has Lady Naoki stop and turn toward the noise. Ah, here comes the drunk. Right on cue, she thinks. The Sentinel accepts the drink, only because he suspects it\u2019ll spill all over his armor otherwise. Holding it awkwardly away from his body, he watches the drunk proceed toward Naoki. His free hand goes to the pommel of his weapon.But Naoki does not call for the guards to take action. She finds the drunk\u2019s antics amusing. They\u2019re about the best one could hope for from someone as drunk as this poor sap. \u201cHappy Yuletide,\u201d she responds, half-smiling.Pulling one hand out of her pockets, Naoki casually tosses a pouch of coins at the man. She aims for his gut, her intention being to knock him over without seeming like she was trying to do so. If he's drunk, she assumes that'll be easily done. The sack will make a satisfying metallic noise on impact, perhaps betraying its contents.\u201cTry not to die of drinking,\u201d she teases. \u201cGet yourself something worthwhile.\u201dUriel would find the pouch to be filled with brand new, freshly minted Isran coins \u2014 fifty gold\u2019s worth. ", "1514627928000": "As the drunk shuffles his way away, Lady Naoki smiles to herself. There goes her latest supporter, off to regale some seedy establishment with tales of her generosity. The delight of gift-giving is certainly an excellent feeling, but there\u2019s also a satisfaction to be had in strengthening her approval ratings. Putting her hands back in her pockets, she resumes her meandering, guards close behind.At the shout of \u201cfree gold,\u201d she turns to look. Has she inspired others? That seems uncharacteristic of the public. That proves to be enough of a distraction. Walking into the string, Lady Naoki trips, shouting in surprise as she falls forward. With the aid of her catlike tail, she\u2019s able to recover partially, twist and land on her behind, thoroughly shaken but not seriously injured.However, she has little time to appreciate her fortune before she is set upon by some gnome-sized bastard. Naoki has another sack of coin similar to the first in her coat pocket. If he\u2019s quick, he might be able to get his hands in there, but she isn\u2019t keen on the idea. Lashing out with one arm, she makes to grab the little thief, preferably by the hair. Failing that, she\u2019ll just as happily catch a bit of clothing, a limb, or whatever else, anything to stop him slipping off.The guards, only a step behind, move to help their Empress, clattering forward in their armor.", "1515098559000": "All of this is quite enough to spook our poor Empress. She was minding her own business, getting her philanthropy in, and now she\u2019s on the floor, covered in damnable gnomes.Equal parts irritated and scared for her life; she manages to grab one of their vests. He\u2019s doing something that isn\u2019t stabbing her, so she figures \u2014 with all the close quarters combat as she is, that it would be a good idea to smack one with the other. He\u2019s small, isn\u2019t he? She can toss children, why not this rat? To this end, she yanks a mighty, adrenalin-fueled yank on Ershadt's vest.If she\u2019s able to, she\u2019ll happily swing him right around into Qelci with no regard for either\u2019s health. However, before she can do much beyond that, Lady Naoki is covered in dust. It\u2019s at this point that she begins to curse. As a somewhat well-read and eloquent individual, she has quite a few choice words to describe Ershadt and Qelci. She draws into question their cleanliness, the legitimacy of their parentage, how they spend their free time and would keep going, were she not to start coughing due to the dust in her mouth.", "1517165193000": "Lady Naoki, not having been allowed to stand up, is roughly yanked to the side as the rat tugs on her coat. It doesn\u2019t rip\u2014it\u2019s a fairly heavy coat, but he pulls Naoki from her back onto her side. A good view from which to watch him scurry away. She mumbles one more expletive for good measure. Sitting up, she finds herself sandwiched between two Sentinels. They\u2019re standing close with their backs to her, weapons raised. Shakily, she gets to her feet and huffs an irritated huff, brushing some of the dust off her person. Looking off in the direction Ershadt disappeared in, Naoki bites her tongue, considering her next move.Then, just as it did during her speech, The Empresses\u2019 calmest, most pleasant tone rings out clearly across The Plaza.\u201cA thousand gold to whoever catches the fleeing gnomes.\u201d", "1521753473000": "With a vengefully irritated expression, The Empress huffs. She huffs, and then she clears her throat, putting the pleasant voice away. Looking about, she sees Grandma, and she glares at her. Grandma could have prevented all of that, easily; she could have vaporized those gnomes in an instant. The bit where Naoki was wrestling on the floor was entirely preventable. But, as unspeakably powerful as she is, Grandma doesn\u2019t practice subtle magic. The Empress supposes it\u2019s probably for the best Grandma didn\u2019t do something. It would be showing a card from their hand and likely terrifying all onlookers.Though Grandma will receive a few more dirty looks over the coming days, The Empress pushes the matter from her mind and turns to consider the hubbub. Looking over the heads of the crowd, she can see that the dragon is here, and something's glowing over in that direction. She\u2019s doubtful that the dragon will be able to catch the gnomes, given the size difference and environment. Though... the gnomes have proven themselves to be profoundly idiotic. Perhaps they\u2019ll do something else stupid.Regardless, the matter is no longer of her consideration. A thousand gold bounty will have all the fortune-hunters on The Plains after them. It's far more than the gnomes are worth. She expects the bastards to be presented to her sometime in the coming weeks, at which point, she will determine an appropriate punishment.For now, it\u2019s back to The Citadel, for a change of clothes and something to eat. Gesturing that she\u2019s moving, The Empress stares a path through the crowd, smiling and waving benevolently the whole way.", "1545705514000": "Off to one side of the plaza, partway up The Citadel stairs stands The Empress, observing the proceedings from her perch. She notes that the crowd isn\u2019t quite as dense as the previous year, but it\u2019s also considerably colder outside, so this is understandable. Perhaps next year, she ought to arrange the weather beforehand.Still, for now, it is cold, and she wouldn\u2019t like to linger longer than she must. Proceeding down the stairs, she crosses the plaza escorted by no fewer than 10 Imperial Sentinels. Last year, she skimped on security and paid the price, which turned out to be about 50 gold and her pride. The criminals are still at large, but this year, assaulting The Empress will be a taller order, made all the more difficult by her full retinue of guards and the set of plated armor she\u2019s wearing. Coming underdressed did not suit her well last Yuletide, so today The Empress has prepared both for battle and the chilly weather, wearing her specially-fitted set of armor. Its burnished orange color doesn\u2019t match exceedingly well with the bright red of her scarf, but oh well.Upon reaching the Yule Log in the center of the plaza, The Empress wastes no time in accepting the torch prepared for her and ascending the temporary staircase erected alongside it.Standing at the top, torch held high, she waits a moment for the crowd to recognize her presence before beginning. \u201cPeople of Isra,\u201d The Empress begins, her voice carrying throughout the city. \u201cWe are gathered here on the shortest day of the year, to celebrate those things which matter most to us. And there\u2019s much to celebrate; these are pleasant times we live in \u2014 untroubled by war, blessed with good harvests, with loyal allies, and strong armies. Through the work of its people, this city, The City of Isra, has grown from its humble beginnings to become the heart of our great Empire, and the focal point around which the civilized world revolves.\u201d\u201cIt is through the work of its farmers that none go hungry in Isra. It is through the work of its Guardsmen, builders, and soldiers that the people of Isra sleep soundly in their beds at night, untroubled by crime, protected from invasion by great walls and mighty legions. Through the work of its traders and merchants, the people of Isra enjoy exotic goods from far-off lands and export their wares for great profit. Through the work of its people, Isra has risen to heights beyond any other in The Overworld!\u201dAn enthusiastic gesture from The Empress prompts a round of cheering. She continues, \u201cAnd so, let us take a few days here, in the cold of winter, to celebrate that. And to celebrate the people who make life worth living: our friends, our neighbors, our loved ones, and those closest to us. Let us celebrate each other and everything we do for each other, the people we care about, the time we spend together, and what we are able to achieve as a group.\u201dIn a smooth motion, The Empress lobs the torch onto the log, causing it to erupt in flames. Within seconds, the entire log is ablaze, burning with such heat that even those on the edges of the Plaza might feel it.The Empress, illuminated by the flames, offers a parting remark, \u201cHappy Yuletide to all!\u201dWith speech delivered and log lit, The Empress descends from the platform. What to do from here, she is unsure. She has plans for later in the evening, but not for a while yet. She wouldn\u2019t like to be assaulted again, but she thinks it wouldn\u2019t be very sporting for her to leave immediately, and so she lingers near the base of the log, reveling in the heat.

Entering in such a manner, her presence isn\u2019t immediately apparent, which allows her to observe the everyday business going on. It\u2019s mostly merchants hawking their wares and those out to purchase said wares, but The Plaza is also a gathering place for the different groups that inhabit Isra. It\u2019s probably not an accurate representation of the city at large, but considering it as such is a comforting thought to have.After meandering around to find a good spot, The Empress decides that she would like to have a seat. Approaching one of the benches that circle the plaza, she seats herself. The Sentinels stand on either side of the bench, and are still rather large and spear-toting.Sitting there on the bench, The Empress continues to observe the plaza. A bit of a hubbub is starting to ripple about as plaza-goers notice \u201cThe Empress is sitting on that bench,\u201d but considering how she\u2019s just sort of\u2026 sitting there, no one is prompted to start screaming or hollering. They\u2019re not quite sure what to do about it, because she\u2019s just\u2026 sitting there, looking at them. Some people back off to give her space and a good number stare, but the majority of those assembled eventually continue about their business.The Empress, for her part, sits there. Aside from her ever-present aura of smugness, it\u2019s difficult to discern if she has any sort of intention or purpose in mind. She\u2019s just\u2026 sitting there.After a brief and questionably-intentional catnap, The Empress rises from the bench and stretches, looking up to see that several hours have passed. The last purple hues of the sunset are receding down into the horizon, and the stars are starting to come out. There are far fewer citizens in the plaza before her, everyone has gone home for dinner, eaten it, and most of the children are probably asleep by now. Although the worst of them would never dare step foot in The Central Plaza, some of the moderately less scrupulous have emerged from their dens and now linger around the edges of the light, peddling, conspiring, and making ready for those things best done under the cover of darkness.What those things might be \u2014 Naoki knows full well, but she doesn\u2019t very much care. Such things are below her and have now taken on an almost endearing element, as just another part of Isra and its life as a city.Regardless, there\u2019s nothing more for her to not do here. Stifling a yawn with the back of her hand, Naoki starts toward The Citadel, mind beginning to consider what manner of Imperial Shenanigans she will perpetrate tonight. ", "1458154719000": "In the waxing light of the mid-morning, just as the sun is beginning to peek over the roofs of the tallest buildings to reach the streets below, Madame Naoki and her party arrive on the streets outside St. James\u2019 Boutique. The sky is bright, blue and cloudless, and the earliest signs of spring are beginning to make themselves known; a small bird of some unremarkable variety is perched on the awning above the door, yammering away in birdsong. As the group approaches, the bird is spooked, and flies off. Naoki watches it go, her ears moving silently to track it. On this fine morning, Madame Naoki is dressed relatively simply, in a white blouse with a pair of pants. In one hand, she carries a large tote bag, protruding out of the top of which is a metallic box. As she comes into view of the Boutique itself, she glances upward to read the sign, confirming that this is their destination. She pauses before approaching the door, glancing back to ensure her companions are still in tow, also casting a sidelong glance to a particular patch of newly laid pavement, where it had been replaced following the intrusion of that damn dragon. ", "1458174055000": "As Naoki turns about to confirm the presence of her companions, she sees Artemis, as always, but\u2026 where\u2019s Skarlet? Behind her, at the door of the shop, the entrance chimes tinkle slightly as Skarlet enters. She had managed to sneak around, and precede Naoki into the shop. Fair enough. Naoki had planned on speaking to Skarlet before entering, but... whatever. Turning back about, Madame Naoki catches the door as it begins to close, and follows Skarlet in, moving fully into the shop to allow Artemis to follow behind. Her eyes adjust to the relative darkness of the interior, and she looks about, taking in the sights to be seen within St. James\u2019 Boutique. She had heard a lot about this place, and it seems to be as high quality as she was informed. Cozy, too. Apparently, the owner of this shop, a Ms. \u2018Genevieve\u2019, is a skilled seamstress, who specializes in her own unique sort of enchanted clothing. One such article of clothing had been given to Naoki by Kate, on the day of their departure to the Chalet, (some weeks ago at this point). A slinky sort of pearly white dress, it is still in the same silver box she had received it in, protruding slightly out of her bag, and may be recognizable. Regardless, the reasons for this visit are many and varied, but before any progress can be made, contact must first be made with the proprietress. Madame Naoki stands quietly a short ways inside the door; Skarlet had already begun greetings, and it wouldn\u2019t do to interrupt. ", "1458188484000": "Naoki raises her unoccupied hand in greeting, nods to Genevieve, and proceeds to introduce herself. Her demeanor is relatively flat, but still friendly. In reality, she is pre-occupied, but doesn\u2019t allow it to have a significant effect. \u201cI am Madame Naoki, head of the Treasury Department, owner of The Midnight Sun, and Skarlet\u2019s adoptive mother. This is Artemis, my associate. Presumably, you are Ms. Genevieve, whom I\u2019ve heard so much about. Many of my friends, Skarlet included, have sung the highest praises of your work. I\u2019ll get directly to first of my matters, as not to waste too much of your time.\u201dShe hefts the bag in her hand, indicating the silver box within. \u201cI received this dress as a gift, and am quite satisfied with it, please don't\u2019 read me the wrong way. However, I have rather unique needs, when it comes to garments, that you could not have possibly accounted for in creating this excellent dress.\u201dTo illustrate, Naoki raises her tail, twitching it about some to draw attention to it. It is- what would seem to be- the tail of a cat; colored to match her hair and ears, sleek and well-groomed, but otherwise unremarkable. After a moment or so, after she\u2019s sure Genevieve has ample opportunity to take note, she allows it to drop back down behind her, where it proceeds to sway idly. \u201cI came to see if it would be possible to alter this garment to account for this unique feature of my physiology. It should be as simple as cutting and hemming a small hole or flap, and I would have done it myself, as I have for the rest of my wardrobe, but thought it better- since I saw that you were back in town, to ask you to make the alteration.\u201d", "1458196934000": "\u201cOf course not. I usually cut holes that are about five or six centimeters in diameter, but the placement is important.\u201dMoving first to the seating area, Madame Naoki places her bag down next to the table, careful to ensure that it sits upright and doesn\u2019t spill. After that, she proceeds to the dais, stepping up and taking a moment to demonstrate the practical aspect of her non-standard appendage, moving it to easily regain her balance atop the dais without any waving of the arms or teetering. From her newfound vantage, she takes a moment to examine her own reflection in the mirror, before shifting focus to look through the mirror behind her, out over the rest of the shop. Naoki is cooperative, and Genevieve would likely find it reasonably easy to take the required measurements, and in doing so, would also see an example of an article of clothing already modified. On the seat of her pants, just at her high hip, the tail protrudes at a downward angle though a small aperture cut and hemmed neatly for the task. The material cut to form the hole was left attached at the top, and has been cut partially to leave a sort of half-flap that rests on the upper portion of her tail as it leaves the garment, presumably to preserve a bit of modesty. Though the tail sits just above the undergarments, if the flap were not there, it would be possible to see a small portion of her lower back just above the tail. ", "1458208152000": "\u201cOh, Kate? She\u2019s doing quite well\u2026\u201dShe trails off, searching for something to follow that statement up with, something that would be appropriate for polite conversation. Naoki hadn\u2019t come prepared for small talk, still somewhat thinking ahead, mind elsewhere. Her eyes wander the interior of the boutique though the mirror, as if there might be some answer hidden among the shelves of fabric. \u201cShe certainly did find an excellent gift. I believe she has something in mind, an occasion she\u2019s planning that would be appropriate to wear the gown to. \u2026 I think that she\u2019s looking forward to the alterations being completed as much as I am.\u201dDissatisfied with her state of preoccupation, Madame Naoki shakes her head slightly, a small movement indicative of her change in mindset. She looks around the shop once again, truly getting a good look this time. She considers fielding a question of her own, but decides not to, content with allowing Genevieve to dictate the course of the conversation for the time being. ", "1458262559000": "\u201cHard to say, I\u2019m not sure what exactly she has in mind, she alluded to something in passing when she gave me the gown. I can\u2019t say that I imagine her planning a city-wide event, though. She was probably referring to a special dinner or something of an equally personal scope.\u201dStepping down from the dias, she casually begins to make her way over to the seating area, still speaking. \u201cThat\u2019s not a bad idea, though. We don\u2019t have very many national holidays here in Isra; we could use a few festivals. Which actually makes for an excellent transition into the next thing I have to speak about, in a roundabout way.\u201d Bending down at the knees, Naoki reaches down into her bag, and pulls out the silver box containing the gown. Before departing for the Chalet, she had taken a moment to wipe the ink from the bottom of the box, though not all of it had come off. A few smudged ink-stains remain, but they have since dried, and are only on the bottom of the box. Removing it carefully from the bag with two hands, she offers it to Genevieve, or would place it somewhere upon suggestion.\u201cYou see, you\u2019ll have plenty of time to complete the alterations, as I\u2019ll be out of town. This time tomorrow, if all goes to plan, I\u2019ll be in Le Palais Royal. At the recent emergency session of the Assembly, I was selected, through a combination of understaffing issues, my proficiency with the language, and\u2026 a fair amount of persuasive wording on my part, to lead a delegation to the sovereign nation of Gauldin, and attempt to establish positive, mutually beneficial, and prosperous diplomatic ties. I would like to consult you, obtain your advice, and perhaps even an outfit that would be\u2026 fitting to wear for such an occasion. Though I am familiar with Gauldin as it pertains to world politics and trade, and have obtained a functional understanding of its culture and customs, my understanding does not extend to its high fashion, and I can\u2019t think of anyone who would be more well-versed than yourself.\u201d", "1458357125000": "Madame Naoki nods, smiling. She didn\u2019t exactly think that Genevieve would deny her advice, and fully expected her to have an outfit perfect for the occasion, but even in observing the expected result, she can\u2019t help but feel pleased. Probably some effect of the magic, she muses. \u201cExcellent, thank you. I\u2019ll be here.\u201dWithout too much more to do, Naoki seats herself on one end of the sofa, and samples one of the scones, finding herself pleasantly surprised with it. Very well made. She casts a glance sidelong at Artemis, using an eyebrow to indicate a silent inquiry. ", "1458431540000": "As Genevieve  returns to the room, Naoki rises, wiping her hand on the provided serviette. She moves away from the couch, and receives the box, holding it carefully in two hands. Before saying anything, her eyes drift; from the sealed box, up to Genevieve\u2019s cheeks, and back down to the box. There\u2019s something more at play here, but she supposes that was to be expected. She\u2019ll give Genevieve the benefit of the doubt, but would definitely be bringing along some supplementary outfits, should this one not work out.When she does speak, after a significant, but not-quite-so-long-as-to-be-rude pause, she does so with a smile on her face and an inflection that carries some of that infectious happiness, \u201cExcellent, thank you, Ms. Genevieve. It sounds to be exactly what I\u2019m looking for; I\u2019ll take your suggestion, and purchase this.\u201dAs Roy enters the shop, Madame Naoki turns to glance at him- as she tends to, when someone enters a room. Something about him seems familiar, but she can\u2019t quite place it. Someone she\u2019s seen in one of Reese\u2019s reports, perhaps? Unsure. Carrying a parasol. A vampire like Skarlet, perhaps? Not a very handsome one, if that\u2019s the case. She categorizes him as \u2018not a viable threat\u2019, and delegates the task of identifying him to Artemis before returning her attention to the box. Spying a bit of parchment attached to one side, she reads the price, nodding slightly. She had expected the price to be high, but also wasn\u2019t carrying quite that much. Gold is awfully heavy, after all. Her earring glimmers slightly as she looks back up to Genevieve.\u201cOne of my associates is on the way with a sum. You\u2019ll definitely be seeing me again when I return, but I doubt that I\u2019ll need to return this gown; I assume the alterations have already been made.\u201dNodding and smiling once more to Genevieve, she shifts the box fully into her left hand, and attempts to shake Genevieve\u2019s hand with her right. Regardless of how her attempt turns out, Madame Naoki proceeds to place the box containing the gown into her bag, in place of the other one, and re-seats herself on the sofa, her business complete for the time being. Taking another scone, she casts her eyes around to the other individuals in the room. Between Artemis, Skarlet, and this baby-faced vampire boy, which one of them would be next to receive Genevieve\u2019s attention?", "1458458307000": "As the activities within the shop continue, Madame Naoki remains seated politely on the couch. She can\u2019t leave until Skarlet and Artemis\u2019 business is completed, and until her operative arrives with the gold. In the meantime, in between bites of scone, she casually observes the dealings, and manages to pin Roy\u2019s identity down with some help from Reese. Royal Fletcher, resident student of The Royal Academy of the Arcane, first year. Dormitory 393, roommate to Mr. Maelik, who is also the source of the entirety of Roy\u2019s file. Naoki had seen his face once as she was conferring with Reese in his office, one of the mirrors was trained to \u2018see\u2019 though Maelik\u2019s eye, and Roy was, at least for a moment or so, the object of Maelik\u2019s attention. However, beyond these basic details, and some notes regarding his exploits with Maelik, Roy, as he appears on file, seems wholly unremarkable. Some minor rune-magics, and the vampirism bit of course, but not particularly powerful or skilled in any way known to Reese. Skarlet\u2019s information is relayed, and also added to file (with a note to follow up with Skarlet later for supplementary information), but does little to add to Roy\u2019s prestige. He may be capable of putting up a fight, simply by virtue of being a vampire, but hardly seems like the sort to pick one, and even if he does decide to, Artemis would have no issues subduing him, to say nothing of Skarlet or the Operatives on the streets outside. With more complete information, Naoki stands by her earlier assessment, of Royal being of no particular importance. However, the other individual entering the room manages to captivate Madame Naoki\u2019s attention more thoroughly, and warrant investigation. This is due in part to Naoki\u2019s predisposition toward curiosity and wishing to know fully of all that happens around her, but in some way, the room\u2019s latest occupant seems to be of some note, though Naoki isn\u2019t quite sure how. For starters, she hadn\u2019t entered through the front door; not a customer. Not only that, but she seemed surprised to see everyone down here. That calls into question either her awareness as an employee, or paints her as something else entirely. Perhaps a family member, or friend? Naoki is unaware of any familial relations Genevieve may or may not possess, but the tax paperwork for this home, (which she had reviewed prior to her visit) only lists Ms. Genevieve St. James, and her daughter, Odette. If this woman is a resident of this establishment, they\u2019re either living here without proper documentation, or visiting. Perhaps from another home in Isra, or perhaps from abroad.Raising a hand in greeting, Naoki nods to the woman, and takes a moment to examine her features. Red hair, blue eyes, wearing clothing intended for travel. Probably made by Ms. Genevieve; the quality isn\u2019t hard to identify, even from across the room. Speaks with a rather heavy Gauldish accent, and addresses Genevieve somewhat casually. Comparing their faces, Naoki notes some resemblances, but is hesitant to base any conclusions on it; she isn\u2019t an expert judge of faces, and most of the resemblance probably lies in that they\u2019re both beautiful Gauldish women of seemingly similar age, and happen to have the same color of eyes.Having gathered what information she can visually, Naoki politely averts her glance, and seemingly switches her focus to one of the floral arrangements sitting near her, though her mind\u2019s eye remains trained on the red-haired woman. Though she seems familiar in some way, Naoki decides that she can\u2019t quite place her, and defers to Reese. If they are someone important, he\u2019ll know, and will probably be able to identify them based on the physical characteristics Naoki is relaying to him now. Her earring glimmers slightly as she does so, and shortly, Reese should locate some results, even if those results are that the woman is as insignificant as Roy, and has so far avoided his notice. Until then, Naoki remains as she is, sitting quietly on the sofa, gaze lazily drifting around the room. She muses that she won\u2019t run out of objects to casually examine any time soon, St. James Boutique certainly has no lack of detail, between the floral arrangements, and all of the highly numerous and well made garments on display. ", "1458523098000": "Madame Naoki returns Roy\u2019s leery eyeing with some mischievous eyeing of her own. Even though she had already inspected Roy, she takes a moment to examine him while he\u2019s looking back, managing to infuse her gaze with a lewd undertone that may or may not make Roy rather uncomfortable. Very deliberately, she raises a hand, and gives a single, short wave, accompanied by one of her winks. Even if he is largely inconsequential, she still finds some enjoyment in teasing for the sake of it. However, a trained eye might notice, one of her ears is still trained in the direction of Genevieve and the newly identified red-haired woman, Arianne. Even if Naoki wasn\u2019t substantially proficient in Gauldish, the names don\u2019t translate. The red-haired woman was referred to as Arianne. Which is highly interesting! Arianne, the name used to refer to the thought-deceased Queen Arianne of Gauldin, wife to King Renaux. They were married last year, in a ceremony which Grandma attended. A few quick communications, consulting Reese\u2019s database confirms. Queen Arianne, as she was observed at her wedding, at least has the very same characteristics as this woman here. Red hair, blue eyes, a decidedly... ample bosom- even the height seems to match, based on Naoki\u2019s rough estimation from across the room, based on how she compares to Genevieve.The rest of their conversation even goes so far as to completely confirm her identity, \"I've decided to go back to Gauldin. To Renaux.\". Though she supposes that the possibility of there being multiple Gauldish women who match Queen Arianne\u2019s description is non-zero, there can only be so many that are also named Arianne, and would speak in such a manner about Gauldin and King Renaux.With evidence overwhelming, Naoki reaches a small collection of conclusions. First, the red-haired woman standing across the room must be either Queen Arianne of Gauldin, or at least someone doing a very admirable job of impersonating them. Secondly, as a sort of extension of the first, and discluding the possibility of a pretender, Queen Arianne must have survived what had thought to be the final voyage of her life. Instead of dying many months ago, lost at sea, she had found a manner by which to survive, and has now made it back to civilization as we know it. Thirdly, there must be some manner of close relationship between Arianne and Genevive; perhaps a familial one, or perhaps one of childhood friends, or of mentor and student. Looking more closely, Naoki realizes that her previous assessment of them being roughly the same age was false, but their conversation has just affirmed that they have some manner of close relationship. Additionally, and not quite so much as a conclusion, per-say, but more-so as an inference or assessment, the pair of them must be pretty awful with the concept of intrigue. To have such a conversation, which essentially fully confirmed Arianne's identity, in the presence of four essentially entirely unknown persons, was incredibly foolish. Naoki could, at a moment\u2019s notice, motion for Artemis to leap over and decapitate or subdue the pair of them. It would be over in a handful of moments, the two would be hopelessly overwhelmed by Artemis. As far as Naoki is able to tell, nothing could stand in her way, if she decides to make that call. There are some calming magics at play in the shop, perhaps, but those have little sway over cold steel. Without knowing if the customers in the shop are able to understand Gauldish, enemies of the Gauldish state, if they had any reason to harm or capture Arianne, or if they had the means to, it was very irresponsible to have that conversation. Loose lips sink ships, and Naoki feels that the pair of them should be more grateful than they know that she is positively inclined toward Genevieve and the Gauldish people. A Naoki that wasn\u2019t an Isranian minister, about to depart as head of a diplomatic embassy to Gauldin, would have twisted and taken full advantage of this opportunity for her own benefit fifty times over by this point. A Queen\u2019s Ransom is an awful lot, and she could probably twist Renaux\u2019 arm into giving her even more than that for the Queen, knowing him to be the unconfident sort of new King he is. The vast and powerful magical knowledge and wealth of Gauldin could be hers, rather easily, too. In fact, in thinking about it, the prospect is undeniably tempting. It doesn\u2019t even have to necessarily have to affect her diplomatic mission, it could be done separately, through a puppet. It isn\u2019t as if Naoki hasn\u2019t done something similar before, she muses.But no. Some combination of moral integrity, the location\u2019s mental magic, and Naoki\u2019s genuine positive opinion of Genevieve force her to dismiss the idea; she could, but won\u2019t. That still leaves a fair selection of options, though. She could simply choose to politely pretend not to have heard, and allow the two to continue on however they see fit. However, her natural tendency to take advantage of opportunities dismisses this course of action swiftly. It would be foolish not to do anything. That leaves one primary option: to attempt to work the situation to her benefit in a way that isn\u2019t disagreeable. Leaning back slightly, she reassess the situation with this strategy in mind, replaying the conversation in her mind, considering how to start taking action. If she\u2019s to assist Arianne, anonymity and security will be paramount. Even if Naoki isn\u2019t willing to take advantage of Arianne, there are plenty of others in the city who would, she knows. Good thing she\u2019s so good at protecting people, Naoki muses. Silently, she calls in reinforcements. Over the course of the next few minutes, Midnight Sun Operatives, previously positioned to act in the event that Naoki\u2019s trip to the Boutique went south, quietly surround the establishment. Roughly twenty of them are diverted from their standard patrols and duties to take up positions around St. James Boutique. Some settle on adjacent roofs, others circle the exterior of the building, identifying all points of entry, they systematically move to control each one.  Some others screen the street outside, assessing and attempting to identify each passer-by. Discluding the possibility of tunnels, it would become virtually impossible in a matter of a few short minutes to enter or exit St. James Boutiqe without getting past the Operatives. However, they are careful not to take up obvious positions around the front door; it wouldn\u2019t do to make their presence obvious. With security taken care of, Naoki turns next to anonymity. Understanding that Artemis and Skarlet would not be issues in this matter, that leaves the singular, glaring problem sitting only a few feet from her, munching on some chocolate and making small talk.Since she understands Roy to be a Gauldish citizen, it is a safe assumption to make that he knows the language. Seeing as how Arianne had been referred to by name, and she was, for a short while at least, The Queen, Roy should have no logical reason not to understand as fully as Naoki does. That makes him a security threat. Even now, as completely oblivious and incompetent as he seems, he could be reporting telepathically to another entity, or have some manner of scrying spell trained on him. Even though he himself is almost certainly unable to stand in their way in any meaningful way, one slip of the lips on his part could easily jeopardize Arianne\u2019s safety. (Assuming that she has any left, if this most recent display is at all indicative of her capacity to keep things quiet.) Naoki hasn\u2019t yet underestimated a potential threat, and doesn\u2019t intend to start now; Roy would need to be taken out.Assessing Roy again with new eyes, Madame Naoki continues her silent deliberation and communication with both Artemis and Skarlet, her face betraying none of her thoughts. One of her hands reaches casually into the black pouch on her hip, and selects a gem. It is a spherical, opaline white gemstone. Holding it concealed in the fingers of her right hand, Naoki quietly begins to channel small amounts of energy into the gem, preparing to utilize it. Still, she gives no outward indication of having understood quite so much, or preparing to take action toward Roy. As something of an expert in the skills of self-control, she manages to perfectly maintain her slight, pleasant smile, and carries on her seemingly casual examination of the shop's wares. ", "1458600428000": "As the furniture begins to rattle and Artemis advises her, Naoki immediately ceases her channeling, dropping the small charge she had built up, and turning the gem over in her hand to display to Odette. \u201cOf course.\u201dShe extends her hand, palm outstretched, displaying the marble to Odette. Should Odette decide to pick it up, Naoki would allow her to, and there would be no magical effects. However, if Odette has the magical skill, she may be able to sense or even utilize the gemstone\u2019s sedative effect. Naoki looks upward to Genevieve as she approaches and poses her question. Royal now knows that Naoki is leaving for Gauldin, and is attempting to freeload. Naoki\u2019s focus shifts, as Roy proceeds to ask if he could join them on their trip. Then some half-dead thief stumbles in, mumbling to Roy. Brilliant. It\u2019s all Naoki can do not to bury her face in her hands, as frustrated with developments as she is. This situation was not supposed to develop in this way. She just came to get a damn dress. Naoki doesn\u2019t mind a couple of opportunistic developments, but this is simply ridiculous, now. However, her smile remains, the corners of her mouth turning upward slightly in a manner that might come off as forced. For the space of a moment, she drums the fingers of her unoccupied hand on the arm of her seat, before launching into action in an attempt to remedy the situation. The chimes attached to the door jingle once again, and another figure enters St. James Boutique. He is an impressively unremarkable man of middling age, dressed in a gray cloak. The symbol of The Midnight Sun is emblazoned on the right breast of his tunic, but is hidden by the cloak. He stands there for a moment, unsure, but presently begins to speak as Naoki puts words in his mouth, her earring glimmering slightly as she does so.\u201cI am with... The hospital!\u201d He extends an arm toward Ravven, collapsed as he is on the floor. \u201cAllow me to assist you, citizen!\u201dWithout waiting for an answer, the man bends down, and attempts to lift Ravven from the floor. Hopefully, in his unconscious state, Ravven wouldn\u2019t be able to do much about it. Assuming Ravven doesn\u2019t struggle or he is stopped, the man abruptly turns about, and exits, turning swiftly to the right and carrying Ravven out of sight.At this point, Naoki stands from her seat, and approaches Roy. She puts on her best convincing face, and implores him, \u201cYou should go with your cousin, he\u2019s hurt. You should accompany him to the hospital and make sure he\u2019s alright. I\u2019ll send someone to find you later, get out of here, gumdrop.\u201dAfter making sure that Royal has all of his items, Naoki drapes an arm around his shoulder and guides him to the door, patting him on the back and ushering him out. With Roy departed, Naoki waves out the open door, before pulling it shut, and flipping the sign to \u2018closed\u2019. With a short mental command, another Operative from the street, a large, burly sort of fellow, moves over to stand in front of the door. There would be no more entering the Boutique for the time being. With this reestablishment of order, Naoki turns about, takes a deep breath, and finally addresses Genevieve. \u201cMs. Genevive. I would be pleased to assist you and your... niece in any way that I can. However, please allow me to first introduce myself.\u201dShe turns to Arianne, placing a hand over her stomach as she performs a respectful bow. Here, she pauses for a moment, considering the etiquette. Is Arianne still a queen, at this point? She hasn\u2019t been officially divorced, just presumed dead. Since she hasn\u2019t actually died, Naoki supposes that she still is the queen, even if her country understands her to be dead. Somewhat like self-exile, perhaps. So if it\u2019s Queen Arianne, what is Naoki? Before she turns over her Letter of Credence to the head of Gauldish state, she isn\u2019t technically an operational Ambassador. But that\u2019s a bit of a technically, she supposes. She was still appointed as such, and has legal authority to act as such, even before the ceremony. That technically puts her on equal footing with Arianne, as a direct representative of Ildesias, a head of state. However, she\u2019s already started bowing, and can\u2019t really take that back. Proceeding forward, Naoki would pose on equal footing with Arianne, but a bit of respect the first time can\u2019t hurt, she supposes. Standing back upright, she addresses Arianne in Gauldish. Her annunciation is correct, but unpracticed. She hasn\u2019t spent very much time around Gaulish speaking individuals, and has not yet fully mastered the use of contractions, but is not quite so unpracticed as to be halting, and is very much understandable in her speech. \u201cI am Madame Naoki, Treasurer of Isra, and Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to the nation of Gauldin. I could not help but overhear your conversation regarding your\u2026 predicament, and would like to formally offer my assistance. Tomorrow, I am departing  with my delegation for Trav\u00e9re. We  will be making use of  a local teleportation anchor to complete the trip in only a few hours. I would like to  offer you the opportunity to  join me on this journey, and return safely to your home. As Ambassador to Gauldin, I consider it my duty to facilitate positive relations wherever possible.\u201d", "1458610539000": "At Arianne\u2019s response, Madame Naoki nods, quietly pleased with it.\u201cThen so it shall be done, Queen Arianne. Unless you\u2019d rather we depart with more immediacy, the plan is to leave early tomorrow morning, and travel by way of the  teleportation anchor at The Black Tower. That will take us to the Black Tower branch in Gauldin, and from there, it is only a few hours on horseback to Trav\u00e9re. If there are no objections, I\u2019ll return tomorrow morning, just as the sun is rising, and pick everyone up in my carriage. From here in the carriage, to the Black Tower, to The Black Tower in Gauldin, then on horseback to Trav\u00e9re. If we make good time, I estimate we can reach our destination before noon tomorrow in Gauldin.\u201dHere, Naoki pauses, takes another deep breath, and reevaluates the situation. Things seem to be back under control. Thank goodness. As she begins to speak again, her tone shifts into a slightly lower gear, a more personal, less professional tone. Some of her stress becomes evident as she allows it to shine through, adding slightly to her sincerity. \u201cI apologize for taking  such swift and decisive action in the past few moments I did not intend to alarm any of you - merely to take all steps necessary to ensure security and safety. The boy, Royal, speaks Gauldish, and is a vampire. I am unsure why he didn\u2019t react to your conversation, surely he should have realized\u2026 but without any understanding of his character, I thought that he might pose a threat to you. If he was displeased with the Gauldish government, perhaps, this could have turned ugly- into  an excellent opportunity for him to take some manner of petty revenge. The same with the other boy, I do not know him, and his condition was not one that inspired confidence. The pair of them are in the care of my men, and will not be harmed, simply held for a time. Should you decide to allow the boy to travel with us, we will collect him shortly before leaving tomorrow.\u201dShe makes eye contact as she addresses Arianne specifically, \u201cYou may consider the matters of your presence, identity, and status as alive as all strictly confidential with me. As an Ambassador, keeping secrets is part of the job. This is Artemis, my personal associate, and Skarlet, my adopted daughter. Neither will so much as imply anything about this to anyone else.\u201dNaoki gestures to each of her companions in turn, prompting them to stand and perhaps say something reassuring or respectful.", "1458626259000": "Once again, Naoki nods, this time with an undertone of consideration. She considers what else might need to be said. \u201cWell, it was excellent to meet you all, and I am pleased that things have turned out this well so far. I have nothing but positive opinions of you all, and look forward to seeing you all early tomorrow morning. Even if the world isn\u2019t to know yet, and even though I haven\u2019t had the pleasure of meeting you before today, I am pleased to have learned of your status, Queen Arianne, and am looking forward to seeing the look on King Renaux\u2019s face when he sees you. I will have a watch placed on this building overnight so you can all rest easily. The possibility of word getting out is still one that exists, and I am always one to take as many precautions as possible, especially in situations such as these.They will not make their presence obvious, or interfere with business, but if you have any concerns, simply yell and they will come running. Do not worry about compensating me, either. It will be quite enough to quite enough to see the royal family reunited and have made friends of you all in the process. Unless any of you have further questions, I ought to excuse myself. There is still much to do today to prepare for tomorrow\u2019s Embassy.\u201dMadame Naoki makes eye contact with each of them briefly in turn, nodding and smiling. She bows slightly in Arianne\u2019s direction, before moving over to collect her bag. She signals for Skarlet and Artemis to collect their things and give their farewells, and moves toward the door. The burly man has since moved out of sight, and Naoki pauses inside the door before opening it to flip the sign back over. As she\u2019s doing so, one last matter crosser her mind, and she turns back to speak once again. \u201cOh, what of the boy? Royal. I\u2019m inclined to give him a substantial sum and send him on his way, but if you would prefer, he could accompany us after signing a nondisclosure agreement.\u201d", "1456583192000": "[Enter with Artemis and Poros Welchion]By the time Madame Naoki arrives at the Moonlight Eclipse, the staff have prepared for her visit and that of her companions. A well-dressed waiter sees the group past the waiting line to a booth on the elevated edge of the main dining hall. On the stage in the center of the room, a small band is assembled and are currently enlivening the atmosphere with some upbeat swing music.Madame Naoki seats herself in the interior of the booth, sliding in to allow Artemis to sit beside her. She moves as if to reach for a menu, but decides against it in mid motion, instead choosing to fold her arms on the table and fiddle still more with that bit of emerald. Her ears swivel and turn as she looks down the table, gazing out over the dining hall below them with her eyes and ears. Figuring it would be best to receive Poros\u2019 mentioned proposition after they receive their food, she doesn\u2019t push him for it, and indeed, doesn\u2019t have very much to say at all, simply making small talk until a member of staff arrives to take their order. \u201cI\u2019m very satisfied with how this placed turned out, and the quality of cuisine served here. What do you two think you\u2019ll have?\u201d", "1456749918000": "Naoki seems completely unfazed by Maelik\u2019s arrival, hulking, fourteen foot tall, spikily armored sort of draconic guy he is. She even seems to be pleased by his arrival; greeting him with a pleasant smile and a raised hand. \u201cAh, Maelik, greetings; it\u2019s good see you. A pleasant surprise; we\u2019ll be eating well today! And indeed, this is Mr. Poros Welchion, and he is to be the first employee of my Treasury Department. Please don\u2019t eat him, he\u2019s actually quite nice, and useful too.\u201d Her last remark is equal parts serious and in jest, which may make it difficult to interpret correctly.Remembering how Maelik preferred to do his own introduction as they were leaving for the Chalet, she opts to stop speaking, and allow him to introduce himself. She might need to buy Poros a new set of trousers afterward, perhaps, but that could be arranged. ", "1456871778000": "As she watches the pair of them interact, Naoki\u2019s smirk remains. Part of the reason she had opted to bring Poros to the Eclipse over the Sun was that she knew Maelik would be working here today. And not only does that mean the finest dining, but it also meant seeing how Poros would react to someone like Maelik. Which is to say, humorously enough to elicit a smirk on her part. As the metaphorical ball of conversation is lobbed back in her direction, she straightens her expression before turning to address Maelik. \u201cI apologize, Maelik, but I\u2019m going to be indecisive again today- as I tend to be, and not have anything particular in mind. You\u2019re already aware of my preferences, so I\u2019d like to ask that you prepare whatever it may be that you think I\u2019d enjoy today. You\u2019ve yet to disappoint, and I don\u2019t expect you to start now, make whatever you\u2019d like. I believe Artemis mentioned something about a steak\u2026What about you, though, Poros? Order whatever you like, this is going to be the best meal you\u2019re going to have until you eat here again, and it\u2019s my treat. \u201dShe trails off, allowing either Artemis or Poros to continue with their dining requests. ", "1457192261000": "As Maelik retreats to the kitchen, Madame Naoki shifts her gaze back to Poros, sitting across the table. Maelik surely has added an interesting component to her \u2018get-to-know-people-dinners\u2019. In addition to seeing what sorts of things her guests prefer to eat, how they handle themselves and behave in semi-informal settings, and having an excellent excuse to interrogate them, Naoki now also gets to see how they react to a fourteen foot tall demon serving them dinner. All very telling, she muses; an excellent unwitting contribution on Maelik's part. Onto the interrogation. Deliberately not addressing what had just transpired, Naoki forges ahead with conversation, \u201cSo, Poros. You mentioned another question for me, earlier. We\u2019ll have a few moments here; it takes a short while to craft masterpieces. I\u2019d be pleased to answer whatever inquiry you had in mind now, or if you\u2019d prefer to save it, I suggest you choose another topic for us to discuss. I\u2019m afraid I don\u2019t have anything in particular to talk about just now.\u201d Resting her chin in the palm of one hand, Naoki\u2019s gaze wanders about leisurely; her expression calm, but otherwise unremarkable. In her other hand, the emerald remains in constant motion, occasionally glinting in the reflected orange light of the small chandelier hanging above their table. ", "1457216451000": "\u201cThe emerald\u2026?\u201dMadame Naoki glances around for a moment bemusedly, before locating the mentioned emerald in her own hand. \u201cOhh, the emerald. This emerald of mine.\u201d Without any further explanation, Naoki channels a bit of energy into the emerald, and sets it delicately on the tabletop. Immediately, it begins to move, shaking, trembling, vibrating its way across the tabletop. She allows it to bounce around for a few moments, before picking it up and bringing it below the table, presumably to place it back into the pouch on her hip. Naoki flashes Poros another of her terribly implicative and mischievous smirks. It lasts only a moment before she clears her expression, leans back, and begins to answer his first question.\u201cAn interesting question, though. I suppose\u2026 I would have someone assess the child. If the child is bleeding or injured, if they haven\u2019t eaten in awhile, these things can be observed or inferred without much effort. Then I would\u2026 probably attempt to assist in some way, I suppose. Most of my decision making process is related to the circumstances at hand, and it\u2019s difficult for me to say with any degree of certainty how I would act in a hypothetical scenario without a lot of detail regarding the situation. I\u2019m not one to stand by and watch anyone - children or not- suffer, if I have the means to remove their suffering without great cost to myself, if that\u2019s your question. I\u2019m not an entirely selfless individual, and there are limits to my generosity before I\u2019ll start to ask for things in return, but I\u2019m willing to pay a few gold to put a smile on the face of a friend, or have one of my associates remedy a minor issue and contribute to a pleasant public atmosphere. Being generous and compassionate in the past has earned me many stalwart allies that stand beside me to this day, so I intend to continue the practice. I hope that\u2019s a suitable answer.\u201d \u201cWhat do you think, Artemis? Assuming I am not present, how would you handle that situation?\u201d", "1457308974000": "\u201cHm.\u201dNaoki places her chin into one hand, and considers the question. \u201cThat\u2019s quite the question, and I could choose to interpret it in a few ways. I\u2019ll choose to interpret it as an inquiry related to how I choose to spend my free time, and what I enjoy doing.\u201dLeaning back off the table, Madame Naoki gazes up toward the ceiling as she begins to speak. \u201cI suppose I\u2019m not particularly interesting in that regard. I\u2019m not one for doing a bunch of crazy drugs, drinking, thrill seeking, or traveling the world. I don\u2019t practice or partake in any forms of combat, or anything  like that. Taking care of my obligations consumes most of my time, so what little time I have to spend freely, I usually choose to spend somewhere warm, comfortable and quiet, preferably with a handful of friends  and books. Not the most thrilling, I know, but most of what I do on a daily basis is interesting enough already. Negotiations can sometimes be quite... exhilarating, if equally exhausting.\u201dAnother smirk tossed in Poros\u2019 direction. Teasing him is also a pretty enjoyable pastime, she thinks. ", "1457361229000": "\u201cFair enough. If you\u2019re going to insist on keeping me in suspense regarding your \u2018offer\u2019, a while longer, I\u2019ll go ahead and continue to bombard you with questions.\u201dFrom her reclining position, Madame Naoki silently laments not having prepared more questions earlier. A bit of forethought on her part could have provided a good question to ask right about now, and provided more meaningful substance to this conversation. After a moment of contemplation, she locates a question. With a short \u201cAh!\u201d, and a raised finger, she poses it to Poros, \u201cThis time tomorrow, you\u2019ll have a full coinpurse and the freedom to spend it however you\u2019d like. How do you plan to spend your first paycheck?\u201d", "1457367910000": "Madame Naoki nods contemplatively. \u201cThat\u2019s a good answer. If you had said that you were planning to blow it all on alcohol and prostitutes, that would have thrown your credibility as someone qualified to make decisions for the nation\u2019s economy into question.\u201dShe exhales sharply, mildly amused with her own statement. \u201cWhy wait to get started on the having drinks part, though?\u201d In response to some perfectly timed silent summons, a waiter appears at the end of their table. From his serving tray, he takes a black ceramic mug filled with some creamy brown substance, and slides it down the table toward Naoki. Naoki receives the mug, and immediately takes a long draw at it, closing her eyes and sighing contentedly to fully experience the chocolatey drink. The waiter also places an interesting, insulated container of the same liquid on the table, as well as an unremarkable bottle of wine and a wineglass for Artemis. Turning to Poros, the waiter inquires with professionally intoned speech, \u201cWhat would you have to drink, sir?\u201d", "1457399806000": "Madame Naoki takes another sip of her drink, and waves her unoccupied hand dismissively. As she finishes with the mouthful, she elaborates. \u201cAs so long as you\u2019re not too hungover to work tomorrow morning, I don\u2019t care how much you drink. Have at it, buddy.\u201dFollowing her confirmation, the waiter nods, and with a slight bow, excuses himself to go obtain the drink. Naoki doesn\u2019t have anything much to say in the intervening time before he returns. From his tray, he takes a large silver tankard engraved with the Midnight Sun symbol, and places it before Poros. \u201cA triple brew, sir. If you do not find it to your liking, we have others.\u201dThe waiter remains at the end of the table to see how Poros finds the ale. If Maelik The Fellblade is to approach, the waiter will respectfully excuse himself to attend to something else. Anything else, really, he wouldn\u2019t fancy being flayed. ", "1457642218000": "As the meal lands neatly before her, Naoki gives Maelik a nod and an appreciative smile in thanks before picking up her silverware and devoting her full attention to the dish before her. \u2026 What is this? This isn\u2019t something Naoki has been served before. Some manner of meat, obviously, but what? Something serpent like. It doesn\u2019t seem to smell of any meat she\u2019s had before\u2026 but it smells pretty good. Deciding not to question it further, Naoki carefully drives her fork into one side of the meat, and uses her knife to cut off a moderately sized portion. She takes just a moment to  examine the new meat before sticking the forkful into her mouth and chewing contemplatively. As prepared as she was for the onslaught of flavor, she can\u2019t help but shut her eyes and tremble a bit as the meat does the juices thing with the flavor and the spices. \u201cMmmmhhh-!\u201dWhatever it is, Madame Naoki evidently enjoys it a considerable amount. It\u2019s never very hard to enjoy Maelik\u2019s cooking, but in this situation, where she hasn\u2019t had lunch and had been building anticipation for this meal throughout most of the day, the cooking hits hard. She takes her time to finish chewing and swallow the first bite, appreciating each nuance of texture and marination. Afterwards, she dabs her lips with a napkin and turns to give Maelik her regards in verbal form. \u201cMaelik, whatever this this- it\u2019s excellent. I don\u2019t mean to doubt you, but I\u2019m beginning to think that you are completely incapable of disappointing. I\u2019m not sure how you manage to cook so well on every occasion, but you have my most sincere thanks yet again. If there\u2019s anything more you desire from me, remember that you need only ask.\u201dGiving Maelik another nod of thanks, she continues to consume the meal, interspersing bites of cocatrice with swigs of her mug. After Maelik concludes his observations and departs, she begins to shoot inquisitive glances at Poros, curious to hear about this mysterious \u2018proposal\u2019 of his. It certainly would be awkward if it turns out to be a proposal in the literal sense, she muses. ", "1458075978000": "As Poros delivers his offer, Madame Naoki listens carefully, resting her chin in folded hands and maintaining eye contact. She wonders why he bothered to mention his siblings; she hasn\u2019t even heard their names, much less met them. She would have no reason to request that Poros use his power on them, no more than she would have reason to request that he use his power on any other unknown stranger on the street. \u201cAn interesting and powerful ability, you have. I appreciate that you\u2019ve informed me of it, and offered to use it at my request.\u201d She drums her fingers on the table, looking absently off to the bandstand for a few moments. \u201cI have a long history with dreams. In addition to my own, I myself am often the subject of the dreams of others.\u201d She leans forward suddenly and pierces him with a gaze, her contemplative mood and casually neutral air gone. In its place is a more dangerous neutrality, like the ready stance of a swordsman; her voice carries deadly steel. \u201cI also have a long history with nightmares, and have found that I am more than capable of causing them myself.\u201dMoving back, and picking up her fork again, the piercing demeanor is gone as quickly as it came, once again casual. \u201cI\u2019ll let you know if I need anyone\u2019s head fooled with; I can\u2019t think of any meaningful ways to request that you use it just now.\u201d Dropping the matter there, she  moves as if to spear another portion of her meal, but finds her plate empty. She hadn\u2019t noticed that she was finishing the meal, and wasn\u2019t able to savor the last bite. Madame Naoki flashes the plate a displeased glare, and settles for another sip of her drink. ", "1458688486000": "\u201cHm.\u201d Madame Naoki pauses; this is another question she wasn\u2019t prepared for. After a short period of chin-in-hand deliberation, she decides that it\u2019s not one that needs a great answer. \u201cTomorrow, in the morning. I don\u2019t really care which hours you work, but I expect you to stay a while, and get a lot done. Maybe we\u2019ll work out formal hours later, but it\u2019s not something I\u2019ve considered yet. Show up sometime vaguely before noon, that\u2019ll be fine.\u201dPicking up her mug, she downs the rest of her drink, and considers the table. Everyone is finished, and there\u2019s nothing more to be done. Perhaps more could be said, but she doesn\u2019t have all night to sit around chatting. Deciding that this meal is complete, Madame Naoki wipes her hands on one of the provided linens, and stands. \u201cThis has been a pleasure. Stay for seconds or dessert if you\u2019d like, and don\u2019t worry about the tab. Like I mentioned before, one of my people will be around soon enough to tighten up your new home. I\u2019ve got more to do tonight, so I\u2019ll see you tomorrow. Until then.\u201dAssuming that Poros has no further inquiries or objections to her departure, Madame Naoki continues with her exit, nodding to Poros before leaving the booth with Artemis, speaking briefly with one of the wait staff before disappearing around a corner and presumably departing. ", "1460603411000": "A thoroughly unremarkable man dressed in the the plain black suit of a Moonlight Eclipse employee approaches the area where Jun and Calico are chatting, and, at a suitable break in the conversation, tactfully inserts himself to address Jun. \u201cMiss Jun? Madame Naoki is waiting for you in the back. If you\u2019d be so kind as to follow me\u2026\u201dAssuming that Jun seems amicable to the suggestion, the employee proceeds to lead her toward the rear of the establishment. Tucked under a stairwell, a small alcove conceals a locked door. As the door closes behind the pair, the background noise of the establishment fades away, leaving only the music: a woman singing softly, presumably relayed through some magical system from the stage in the main lounge. A carpeted hallway leads back into the establishment, the walls dotted periodically with locked doors. The servant ushers inside one of these doors, and closes it behind her.Beyond the door, lamplight flickers dimly through the gauzy blue fabric of a curtain. When the curtain is pulled aside, a set of steps is revealed, leading down into a sunken dining area. A wide, flat couch, upholstered in blue velvet, rims the rectangular pit and encircles a simple wooden table. The couch is piled high all around with a variety of cushions and pillows, done up in purples, blues, blacks, and pearlescent silvers. Fabrics drape the walls, and hanging silver lamps illuminate the room. The music filters quietly through the hangings, giving life to the soundscape of the room.On a luxurious-looking mound of pillows, Madame Naoki lounges, the vibrant red of her close-fitting gown standing in sharp relief to the cool tones of her impromptu throne. Pale gold fluid makes lazy circuits of a wine glass suspended in her left hand as she swirls it idly.To her right, Artemis reposes amid her own pile of cushions, sitting slightly more upright. A strapless yellow dress wound with green fabric and an ornately coifed hairstyle stand in sharp contrast to her usually demure attire.", "1460669898000": "\u201cThanks, Jun. It\u2019s good to see you, too. So, what do you think?\u201dWith her unoccupied hand, Madame Naoki gestures about to their surroundings, referring to the dining area. This is the first opportunity she\u2019s had to use this hospitality den, and isn\u2019t quite sure what she thinks. It has an atmosphere to it, sure, but\u2026 Her opinions aren\u2019t fully formed. She looks to consult Jun\u2019s opinion. ", "1460763115000": "Madame Naoki receives the soup and manages to relay a few spoonfuls to her mouth before Jun poses her question. \u201cRight to the point, I see...\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t have anything as pointed as that in mind, though. I didn\u2019t invite you back here to sweet-talk you into doing some task for me, or make a one-time deal. I\u2019ve invited you back here to establish and develop a relationship. You and I, we both stand to gain a lot from the other. I have the information, connections, resources, and tactical minds to know what ought to be done and arrange the logistical and command infrastructure to accomplish major feats. I\u2019ve gotten this far without any truly high-profile warriors at my side. You have what I understand to be one of the greatest capacities to utilise magic in this generation. I heard about you before I even properly established my information network. I have multiple firsthand accounts of your power, and the things you\u2019ve been able to accomplish essentially working out of your backpack. Working together, we each have the capacity to further the other\u2019s agenda in massive ways. Naturally complimenting capabilities, if you will.\u201dNaoki pauses, and takes a moment to swirl and then sip at her drink before continuing. \u201cSo I suppose the first thing I\u2019d like to suggest is either employment in one of my organizations, or a formal alliance between us. The terms of either one of those are, of course, highly negotiable and largely up to you, but I can offer essentially anything. Access to the full extent of my knowledge for your discrete usage, and enough material resources and wealth to support your activities would presumably be standard, but I can offer so much more.\u201d\u201cBefore we can get into that, though, what do you think? Are you willing to work with me?\u201dAcross the table, Naoki fixes her gaze on Jun in an attempt to accurately read her reaction. ", "1460788697000": "Madame Naoki takes a moment to consider Jun\u2019s words, before nodding once in affirmation.\u201c... I think so, yes. If not quite the full complexities and nuances of your worldviews or why you think the way you do, I can take and understand your words at face value. You\u2019d like opportunities to broker peace and protect innocents, and I think that I can provide those. At the very least, I can point you toward where tensions are building, or where innocents are in danger, get you there in one piece, and give you all the supplies you need to accomplish your goal.\u201d\u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t see too many opportunities arising where you\u2019ll be able to walk in and talk things out with people. Those sorts of situations are rarer than they really should be. The \u2018protecting the innocents\u2019 and \u2018stopping evil\u2019 are much more practically achievable goals, in my mind.  \u201cYou\u2019re not going to see me inciting any wars, killing things for no valid reason, or asking you to in my stead. That\u2019s not my style. If I want something done, I want it done for a valid reason, that either expands my ability to get things done, improves the world I\u2019m living in, or protects those I care about. Every action I\u2019ve taken or ordered up until this point generally falls into one of those broad categories, and those are my primary considerations at all times. Never will I ever when dealing with you, nor have I ever, when dealing with other associates, ask you to do something I know you\u2019ll find distasteful, or force you into taking actions you find reprehensible. In entering into an arrangement with me- and this will be made more clear in the papers- don\u2019t feel as if you\u2019re singing your free will over to me. \u2026\u201dShe pauses for a moment in consideration, before deciding to continue.\u201cI was once part of an arrangement like that, and because of that experience, don\u2019t plan on forcing any of my associates to do anything. People do what I ask them to because they know I\u2019m asking for a valid reason, and trust me and my ability to decide what needs to be done, and by whom. If you ever have an objection to something I ask you to do, all you need to do is voice it.\u201d\u201cWith that in said, I\u2019m probably going to ask you to sometimes do tasks that aren\u2019t directly related to one of your three stated goals, but rather one of my own. I think that\u2019s probably reasonably fair, considering that this is to be a two way street, and our goals really aren\u2019t quite that different.\u201d \u201cThe gold is trivial, I could afford to pay you ten times that amount and not bat an eye. As for the shield, I\u2019m willing to offer you any of the ones in my armories, but none of them are particularly special, to be honest. However, I am willing to cover the cost of one you might find for sale, or assist you in locating and acquiring one through other means. Further, as it turns out, there is a master smith over at The Sun right now, and I\u2019m currently in the process of constructing one of the largest and most expansive equipment creation facilities to my knowledge. If you can\u2019t find what you\u2019re looking for now, once it is operational and staffed, you\u2019ll be able to have whatever you please commissioned there. Beyond that, continuing forward with payment into the future, I\u2019m willing to essentially use all means available to me to assist you in acquiring whatever it is that you might need within reason, as long as you\u2019re willing to put in every reasonable effort to assist me in whatever manner you can. I think that your abilities are sufficient to warrant that level of full cooperation between us. With all of that said, I\u2019ll ask again: are you willing to work with me?\u201d", "1460792496000": "Madame Naoki takes and shakes Jun\u2019s offered hand, and withdraws as Jun stands. \u201cNo worries. It\u2019s good that you get emotional about some topics. Means that you care about something. I\u2019m sure that you\u2019re able to keep your emotions in check when they might get in the way of acting efficiently and effectively, so venting in situations such as these is no trouble.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not quite sure what to do about Goraia, though. As nice as it may be to take a shot at them, perhaps regain a trade partner or even install a puppet ruler, I can\u2019t really justify more than keeping a careful eye on them. Not to The Assembly, or my wallet. Any significant action would essentially have to involve an army, and would not be without a hefty amount of bloodshed. I don\u2019t have enough soldiers at my direct command to consider the notion alone, or a valid reason for any nation to wage war. I\u2019ll continue to keep collecting information and will keep you posted as to any major developments, but we have neither the resources nor the justification to take action just yet, I don\u2019t think. Perhaps once more information comes to light.\u201dNaoki polishes off the remainder of her soup and considers for a moment, consulting her memory of Jun\u2019s file.\u201c... Speaking of, didn\u2019t you live in Medan?\u201d", "1460795895000": "\u201cWell, seeing as your last home is either inaccessible or destroyed, that leaves you homeless, doesn\u2019t it? As much as I can respect empathise with the \u2018living out of a backpack\u2019 lifestyle, everyone should have a place where they can truly relax and feel at peace.\u201d\u201cTo that end, allow me to offer you this! I have a house up in the Norkari mountains. Perhaps\u2026 three hundred kilometers in\u2026\u201d After taking a moment to orient herself, Naoki points a finger in a seemingly arbitrary direction to Jun\u2019s left. \u201cThat direction. It\u2019s a large house, with capacity for eighty or so individuals, if all the beds are filled, and only a small fraction of them are. I\u2019d like to invite you to live there and fill one.\u201d\u201cI think that this is probably the first of many win-win arrangements for us. You see, not only is it obviously an excellent house in all senses of the word, but it\u2019s also very heavily defended. I\u2019ve implemented every manner of security and defensive measure available to me, and it also has all manner of accommodations and equipment that would be somewhat infeasible to implement elsewhere. The prime example of this would be the teleportation equipment, the very same sort that you used to move between Black Tower branches. I can\u2019t be bothered to walk all the way out there, after all.\u201dAs if she is mimicking a merchant, Naoki raises a finger and leans inward to deliver her next statement in a tone that could be described as rather silly.\u201cBut wait, there\u2019s more! On top of all that, Ms. Lum and Maelik already reside there, along with Miss Ayra and a handful of others. In the interest of being transparent, I offer this both as the first way in which I intend to assist you to the full extent of my capabilities, but also, by making your home the same as mine, I would presumably have your help in defending it, should the need arise.\u201d", "1460833196000": "\u201cAs long as you share, yes.\u201d Which one of Jun\u2019s questions Naoki is intending to answer is left completely ambiguous, but is stated with what appears to be complete seriousness. Raising her glass, she takes a moment to examine the color and transparency of her drink, before first taking a short sip, followed by a longer one. \u201cMm. This is a good wine, you should try it. There will, of course, be a bit of paperwork to finalise all of this, both for you and I, and also for whoever you\u2019d like to bring over. Non-disclosure, security clearance agreements and the like, but we can get to those once we\u2019re finished here. Additionally, since you\u2019re probably not a Medanese citizen any more, I would encourage you to file for Isranian citizenship.\u201d\u201cBeyond that, I think we\u2019ve about covered the terms of our arrangement for the time being. There are more things I\u2019d like to tell you, more details to share, and more conversations I\u2019d like to have, and lots of stories I\u2019d like to hear you tell, but there will be time for those later. Do you have any further questions, requests, or inquiries, before we proceed to hashing out the details of our formal agreement?\u201d", "1460856716000": "\u201cHm. I would have assumed that you transferred your citizenship to Medan when you joined Princess Camilla\u2019s entourage. Seems like that would be a full time and resident job. You should sort that out, though; if you don\u2019t live in the Land Tillers\u2019 State, you should probably transfer your primary citizenship. That\u2019s just my opinion, though, it\u2019s not a big deal if you want to remain unaffiliated with the city.. It\u2019s not as if I\u2019m not already housing and employing a bunch of unregistered immigrants. What\u2019s one more, especially when they\u2019re as cute as you?\u201dNaoki shoots Jun a single flirtatious wink before abruptly turning away to signal to some attendant beyond the curtains. A few moments later, the elven attendant returns, this time with a pair of lapdesks, ink, quills, and enough parchment for Naoki to begin drafting the necessary documentation. They contain all of the aforementioned terms and agreements, as well as some other basic, obvious things, such as Jun agreeing not to disclose any information that is made available to her through her high security clearance. With a quill in her right hand and glass of wine in her left, Naoki proceeds to alternate paragraphs of writing with consulting Jun for her input and sips of wine, the glass rising to full lips in a manner that turns the mundane action into something almost suggestive. The process doesn\u2019t take too terribly long, and before long, a set of agreements suitable to both parties are completed and presumably signed. With the documents handled, and her last signature signed, Naoki tosses the quill onto the table with an air of finality. \u201cThere we are, all finished.\u201d\u201cUnrelated subject. I saw that you were chatting with Calico up there. I take it from your interactions that you two\u2026 know each other?\u201d Her tone, and the insinuating eyebrow waggle leave little doubt about what she really means by the statement.", "1460874371000": "\u201cDid you, now?\u201d Naoki chuckles a bit. She hadn\u2019t really been expecting much else, but Jun\u2019s confidence is encouraging. \u201cThat\u2019s not too great of an achievement, though, in my opinion.\u201d With that, she drains her glass, trusting Jun to follow suit. Social influence is one of the largest tools in Naoki\u2019s arsenal; she wields the great Sword of Conformity with all of the wit and skill of a master sabreur, leading her companion along, influencing them to take actions that lead into an advantageous position for Naoki.\u00a0\u201cTo be honest, I did the same thing, shortly after concluding the deal that resulted in this establishment. I think we can probably agree, for as savvy a businessman as Calico is, his stamina is somewhat\u2026 lacking.\u201d She chuckles again; humor is disarming. As she does so, she reaches across to pat the upper portion of Jun\u2019s arm. Introducing physical contact in a perfectly benign way. After an appropriate amount of time has passed, Naoki concludes her laugher and continues speaking. \u201cIt\u2019s something of a tradition or perhaps a procedure I have, actually. Whenever I can, I treat my guests or business partners to a meal, and get to know them and talk business over some fine food. There\u2019s a lot one can learn about an individual from across a diner table, I\u2019ve found. Then, afterwards, depending on how well the business goes, and what I think of the individual\u2026 Well. Like I mentioned, Mr. Swartz left that day satisfied in more ways than one.\u201d Instead of following that statement up with laughter, Naoki chooses this moment to make her move. Around the table she slinks, using the pillow she\u2019s sitting on as a sort of sled to slide around the couch, stopping just short of Jun\u2019s thigh, where she gingerly places the palm of her hand. She bows her head slightly to make eye contact with Jun, and intones with her best sensual tone, \u201cI think that our negotiations went quite well, and I consider you with very high esteem. What do you say we conclude this business meeting with a happy ending?\u201d", "1460916212000": "\u201c... Jun?\u201dUsing the hand already placed, Naoki gently jostles Jun\u2019s thigh. No response. \u201cJun.\u201dNaoki reaches over, extending a finger to prod the side of Jun\u2019s breast. Though it does jiggle slightly, there is no sign of consciousness. \u201c... Dammit, Jun.\u201d\u201cWhat am I supposed to do about\u2026?!\u201d In a great huff, Naoki stands, revealing a small patch of slightly darker, slightly damp pillow where she had been sitting. She is not immune to anticipation, afterall. Abruptly, she wheels about, extending her arm to point sharply in a seemingly random direction behind the curtains. \u201cYou! Bring me the kit!\u201dThe curtains ruffle slightly, and the lithe form of the Elven waitress stands upright and moves from behind the curtain. Though she is clearly blushing in embarrassment of being so easily found out, she manages to stammer out a response, \u201cW-w-which kit, Madame?\u201dNaoki fixes her with an incredulous gaze. \u201cHow many kits do you have?\u201dThe elf begins to count on her fingers, \u201cWell, we have several toy kits, the leathers, the restraint kits for both male and fema-\u201dNaoki cuts her off, \u201cNonononono, not those! I mean the medical kit! The others- those are \u2018sets\u2019, \u2018costumes\u2019, and \u2018restraint equipment\u2019, respectively! Get your terminology straight, and get me the medical kit!\u201d\u201cY-yes Madame!\u201d The elf hurries off. Naoki considers the comatose form of Jun with an eye of disappointment and condescension. The nerve!... Passing out like that. Rude, is what it was. Naoki had wined her, she had dined her, and she had made a perfectly decent and respectful advance, and all Jun could do in response was to pass out! Not a polite but firm refusal, not an embarrassed but ultimately futile attempt at rebuttal, not even some soft murmur about how Jun thought she perceived her sexuality before Naoki\u2019s lips changed her mind!She just passed out! That\u2019s simply disrespectful!\u201cThe medical kit, Madame.\u201d The elf had returned, carrying an ornate wooden box with a brass latch on the front.Naoki turns and brusquely takes the box from her grip, before setting it down on one of the adjacent couches and, after undoing the latch, opening the lid. As the lid opens, layered trays fold outward, displaying their contents of what are presumably medical supplies. One tray gives host to a small collection of gemstones. Another, small vials of multicolored liquids. Some of the trays even hold traditional medical supplies, bandages and the like. The elf disappears behind the curtains, hoping to avoid further embarrassment. Naoki\u2019s eyes flicker between Jun\u2019s unconscious form and the options before her. First, Naoki pulls out  a small jar of some very viscous blue gel. A paralysis gel. Forcing Jun to ingest some of this would render her almost completely unable to move her muscles, disabling such things as the vocal cords and movement of the limbs, but leaving such crucial and instinctual things as the heartbeat, eye movement, and certain other physical responses intact. With this, it would be trivial for Naoki to impose her will upon Jun. She could be forced to watch helpless as Naoki has her way with her. As with all of the products in her kit, Naoki had personally tested this concoction with Artemis, and they both found it to be quite stimulating, no matter whether one was the paralyzer or the paralyzee.However, the gel would also leave Jun unable to reciprocate, and judging by the damp spot, Naoki finds this solution unacceptable. It would be sort of rapey besides, she admits. Not really the best for continued relations if Jun finds she doesn\u2019t agree with the premise, even if there is a great deal pleasure involved for her.Retiring the gel to its compartment, Naoki next considers a small vial of vaguely translucent lavender fluid. She knows this one all too well to be an aphrodisiac of the highest magnitude. Naoki remembers- just vaguely- the weekend that Artemis had decided to pair this with a stimulant of the same extreme effectiveness. A drop or two of this onto Jun\u2019s tongue, and instincts would surely prevail over reason, leading to hours upon hours of pleasure. To be completely honest, Naoki cannot help but admit that the lavender fluid seems pretty damn appealing. If only a few glasses of wine had done this to Jun, Naoki can only imagine, (to the detriment of the poor pillow), what a couple drops of this would inspire her to do. Leveraging Jun\u2019s low tolerances to Naoki\u2019s advantage in the best possible way would be a delicious irony\u2026 It would still be rather heavy-handed, though, and it would be readily apparent to Jun after the fact that she was drugged. Naoki sets the vial carefully down to one side on the table, shelving, but not discarding the option, and continues to consult the kit. A vial of shimmering gray liquid catches her eye next. This particular concoction was an interesting and rather widely applicable one. It fully removed the physical effects of intoxication, and replaced them with a more predictable suite of effects, partially emulating drunkenness, but also acting as an aphrodisiac. For people who were unaccustomed to being drunk, they often simply accepted it as the effects of alcohol. Jun\u2019s low tolerance did present an issue here; Naoki was unsure how much of a dose would be required, and alchemicals could be dangerous if overused. With a sigh, she replaces the vial into the kit. It wouldn\u2019t do to cripple Jun.A sweep of the eye confirms that none of the other concoctions would be relevant to this situation. Hmph. She would have to do this via more traditional means. Her mind whirs as she considers the tools at hand. Waking Jun up would be trivial, she had several methods to do that. The real challenge lay in the aftermath of that. She was confident in her ability to seduce if her mark was actually conscious, but a little insurance never hurt. There was always the lingering possibility that Jun considered herself exclusively heterosexual. An aphrodisiac should go quite a ways towards alleviating that pesky inhibition, but there was another weapon in her arsenal. A weapon that Jun trusted, with a feathered head. Turning it from a lesbian experience into a group experience would probably kill off any lingering doubts, and she could always have Artemis take a turn with Calico once Jun had succumbed. That would put him out like a light in short order.Pivoting on her pillow, the fabric sticking to her slightly as she does so, Naoki once again snaps, and levels a finger at the elf. \u201cYou! The candles!\u201d\u201cW-w-which candles, Madame?\u201dNaoki fixes the elven attendant with another gaze, this one somehow more incredulous than the last.  \u201cYou know full well which candles I mean, Aliya! The sexing candles!\u201d\u201cH-how many of them, Madame?\u201dNaoki simply tilts her head slightly to the side, a long-suffering expression on her face, and stares at the elf.\u201cO-of course, Madame!\u201d The elf bustles off, to return shortly, arms laden with portly red candles, and a small firestarter nestled in her bosom. She sets down the majority of the candles on the table, before taking the firestarter and the remainder of the candles and beginning to set them up and light them around the room. As she\u2019s doing so, Naoki proceeds to pack up the medical kit, leaving a few choice items on the table near her, but restoring the rest to their rightful place in the box, before closing it, latching it, and sliding it below the table.As the heady aroma of the candles begins to fill the room, Naoki regards Jun\u2019s sleeping form, drooling lightly on one of the pillows. Heat starts to build in Naoki\u2019s core - of two different types. If Jun, after Naoki went to this much trouble, denied her again\u2026 why\u2026 why, oh! The thought of it very nearly causes Naoki to do something rash. If such a future came to be, she likely very well would. Regardless, a few minutes and burned-elf-fingers later, Aliya is finished setting up the candles, and their aroma fully permeates the air. Naoki inhales deeply, places her palm on her left breast, still covered as it is by her dress, and trembles slightly at the mere contact. They\u2019re working.Once again, Naoki levels her pointed finger at Aliya, who is blushing furiously at this point and struggling to maintain her self control, clasping her hands in front of her in an attempt to keep them from wandering. Naoki\u2019s order is issued with absolute certainty, \u201cGo get Calico, and bring him down here. I don\u2019t care what he\u2019s doing; drag him by the feathers, if you must.\u201d\u201cY-yes Madame!\u201d Aliya moves swiftly from the room, still clasping her hands tightly together.. \u201cAnd hurry up, Aliya!\u201d \u201cY-esss, Madaaaame\u2026\u201d comes a shaky voice from beyond the door.Shortly thereafter, Aliya arrives before Calico in the lounge above, and curtsies slightly, as is probably appropriate. Though her face is still somewhat flushed, and one with a keen sense of smell may be able to discern the mixtures of scents that still cling to her, she manages to conduct herself with some semblance of elegant coherence. She intones quietly, \u201cMadame Naoki would like to see you in her den, Mr. Swartz. Immediately.\u201d", "1460918371000": "Naoki stands as Calico enters the room, the pillow following her up for a moment before dropping to the ground.\u201cCalico! You\u2019re just in time. She's fine. Come in, come in, have a seat, lose your coat. Maybe your pants, too.\u201dNaoki gestures idly toward one of the unoccupied couches before returning her attention to her unconscious conquest. From the small pile of supplies selected from the medical kit, she selects a small vinaigrette. White crystals sit silently in the lowermost portion of the bottle. Salt of hartshorn. At some unseen signal, the band playing in the lounge above changes their tune, somewhat abruptly. The Manasynth artist comes into the fullness of his element, beginning to belt out the smooth sort of rhythm that only he can.\u00a0Naoki attempts to carefully remove the cork, but after a few moments of struggling, finds herself unable. In frustration, she takes the cork into her mouth and yanks mighty, easily pulling it from the bottle. Spitting the cork off to one side, she uses one hand to waft some of the aroma in the bottle to her nose. She is taken aback by the strength of the salt, but also pleased. This would wake Jun up immediately, without a doubt. With no further delay, a slightly trembling hand holds the vinaigrette adjacent to Jun\u2019s sleeping face, and waits for the results. ", "1460973374000": "Madame Naoki\u2019s incredulous gaze finds new targets in Jun and Calico, switching between the two rapidly. Do they really not realize what\u2019s trying to go on here? Are the candles ineffective, were her instructions unclear? Or are they simply that oblivious to her intentions?She exhales sharply, and begins to speak slowly, and somehow still with some degree of patience, \u201cAllow me to do a succinct recap for those of us who have only just arrived. I have something of a procedure when conducting business. First, I almost always treat my associate in business to dinner, and get to know them over a good meal.\u201dWith an open palm, Naoki indicates the partially filled plates and cutlery still present on the table. \u201cAfterwards, we conduct business and settle on the terms of our agreements.\u201dNaoki then moves her indicating hand to point towards the stack of completed and signed documents lying in the center of the table. \u201cAnd then, assuming that all goes well (as it has in this case), more often than not, myself, the individual with whom I\u2019ve just completed business with, and occasionally special guests engage in what could politely be termed as 'carnal pleasures'. I'll admit, the process was slightly out of order with you, Calico, but you hardly seemed to mind at the time. However, if it\u2019s quite alright with the pair of you, I\u2019d like to get started already.\u201d A intonation\u00a0of firm urgency creeps into the rear end of her statement.", "1461033834000": "The minutes that Jun spends in introspection and deliberation erode the remainder of Naoki\u2019s patience. She sits very still on the couch, palms restrained beneath her thighs. When she speaks, she does so rather slowly, obviously exercising a great deal of restraint. \u201cFair enough, Jun. I understand, even if I don\u2019t agree. I have a lot of things to say about this, but in precisely one minute, I\u2019m going to tackle someone. If you wouldn\u2019t like it to be you, I suggest you go wait upstairs.\u201d", "1461116840000": "After locating Jun\u2019s resting place, Madame Naoki makes her way over to the couch, moving with an air of composure, arms held behind her back, perhaps concealing something. As she reaches the side of the couch, she taps a sandal on the floor and addresses Jun. \u201cOi. You feeling alright, there?\u201d", "1461136959000": "At Jun\u2019s mention of her self-service, Madame Naoki\u2019s brow furrows slightly as she takes a moment to evaluate what Jun said earlier with a clear head. What a strange sort of situation. Jun seems rather intelligent, if perhaps a bit oblivious at times. Why would she have willingly entered into a relationship wherein she doesn\u2019t feel as if she\u2019s free to do as she pleases? Based on Naoki\u2019s own understanding of how those things are supposed to work, that seems highly counterintuitive, not to mention undesirable for Jun. Regardless, that\u2019s a topic for another time; Naoki clears it from the forefront of her mind and addresses Jun.\u201cAs a matter of fact, it is. Here.\u201dFrom behind her back, Madame Naoki pulls what would seem to be a somewhat silken black ribbon with two clasps on the end. On one of the silver clasps, a purple faceted gemstone is embedded, such so that when the clasp is shut, it is hidden behind the centerpiece. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that this is more of a business outfitting than a personal favor, but I intended to do the personal business downstairs. Anyway, this is a more advanced communicative gemstone for you to use. It allows for greater telepathic ability, and has a handful of useful minor enchantments. As long as you don\u2019t ask how I got the measurement of your neck, I would encourage you to try this on, and return the ring, there.\u201d", "1461188313000": "As Jun tests her newfound telepathic capabilities, Madame Naoki winces mentally, but says nothing of it, simply listening. She stands there, face totally placid, as the floating, arbitrary thoughts of Jun\u2019s mind are given voice. Maybe Naoki should have offered to provide Jun housing in a mental asylum instead of The Chalet. She responds verbally, doing her best not to let on, \u201cYes, Jun. It works. Looks good, too. A good accessory to plan your wardrobe around. Maybe wear it with only a set of black heels, that would be a good look for you, I think.\u201dMoving around the couch, Madame Naoki seats herself to Jun\u2019s left, and begins to speak again. \u201cIn addition to that, I also have an assignment I\u2019d like you to tackle. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve mentioned this to you, but I am Isra\u2019s Ambassador to Gauldin. As part of some pacts I\u2019ve forged, trade between the two nations is going to open in earnest very soon. I\u2019m talking massive volumes of intercontinental trade, on a scale hitherto unseen in this world. A serious logistical challenge I\u2019m enjoying solving. It\u2019s going to be exceptionally prosperous and excellent for all involved if everything goes smoothly, but there are a handful of factors that I\u2019m aware of, even now, that may interfere with operations.\u201d\u201cThe trade is going to be conducted both by Gauldin\u2019s merchant air navy, and traditional sailing ships either contracted by Isra or independent merchants. The plan is to route goods primarily through Carmella Island (which was recently annexed by Gauldin), and use it as a sort of midway staging point. I\u2019m going to have a road constructed from Isra to Carmella, and the idea would be to take things by cart, over land to Carmella, and then load the goods onto ships of some variety to get them the rest of the way to Gauldin. And the reverse to get goods from Gauldin to Isra; a two way street, as it were.\u201d\u201cMost of the logistical and infrastructural problems, I\u2019m already aware of and working to remedy though my own means. However, there are a number of other factors that I can\u2019t quite solve with industry and careful planning. Pirates, for one. But they can be deterred by force, and I\u2019m not really going to ask you to go around doing something as mundane as setting pirates aflame. No, what I have for you is a little bit more of a special case.\u201d\u201cThe\u2026 colloquial term, as it were, would be \u2018sea monster\u2019. As in, there\u2019s something out there, in the ocean, where my shipping routes need to run, something that has become something of a legend or myth with the sailors who operate in that area. I don\u2019t have any firsthand information, but they say that those who harm the sea will incur \u2018her\u2019 wrath. Again, I\u2019m not really sure who \u2018she\u2019 is, what sort of being they might be, if they\u2019re sentient or not, or really anything beyond what I just told you. My information in the area is somewhat limited;  I\u2019ve only just expanded into the region, and I don\u2019t have massive loads of sea men at my disposal quite yet.\u201dNaoki momentarily breaks the informational tone of her monologue to flashe Jun what could only be described as a salacious wink. \u201cHence, I\u2019d like to ask you to head over there, and figure out what all is going on. Attempt to gather more information about whatever sort of beast it is that inhabits those waters, and make sure that whatever it is, it won\u2019t pose an issue for my shipping routes. How you do that is entirely left to your discretion, so long as my trade ships aren\u2019t attacked.\u201d", "1461193946000": "\u201cI feel confident that if the creature, whatever it is, is intelligent enough to make reasonable demands, and meeting those demands would mean that all of my ships get through safely, I will be able to finagle things in the logistical and diplomatic departments to see the demands met.\u201d \u201cHowever. My ships are going through, and that is non-negotiable. I\u2019ll not make any effort to meet completely unreasonable demands, and however things turn out, my ships are going to start sailing in about twenty days. If necessary, I\u2019ll see them armed, organized in convoys, and staffed with marines, prepared to deal with whatever threat may present itself. \u2026 Actually, they\u2019re going to be in convoys regardless, but my point stands.\u201d\u201cRegardless, this needs to be done; you\u2019re going to do it however you see fit, and I\u2019m going to support you to the full extent of my capabilities. That\u2019s what all of those papers were about, mostly. A portion of my status as Plenipotentiary Ambassador extends to you, in that I\u2019ve appointed you officially as a sort of special agent, able to act in an official capacity in my stead. Before you leave, I\u2019m going to provide you with some identification papers that designate you as such. They should, in combination with some communications I\u2019m going to make to Gauldish Command, allow you free passage and authority to do essentially as you please when handling this matter, in addition to formal support from their Royal Air. Once you reach Carmella, poke around until you find some military sorts. Go up the chain of command until you find someone who can read your identification, and state your mission to them. They should provide transportation and tactical assistance.\u201d\u201cBeyond that, if you need any materials or resources- for any reason at all, not even necessarily related to this matter, all you need to do is ask. Like I said before, I\u2019m willing to assist you to the full extent of my capabilities, as long as you do the same for me. Just ask. ... Maybe say please.\u201d", "1461362914000": "Madame Naoki turns her head to consider Jun with a multifaceted gaze. Elements of simmering frustration, desire, and confusion are all present as she carefully folds her hands in her lap. One ear twitches before she begins to speak softly, maintaining the glare, \u201cYou really shouldn\u2019t tease me like that, Jun, if you intend to preserve your abstemiousness. If we weren't in a public setting right now\u2026\u201dTrembling slightly, Naoki turns her gaze upward to consider one of the room\u2019s many chandeliers, exhales deeply, and shuts her eyes. In this manner, she intones placidly, \u201cSome of the papers have to be signed in The Citadel. They\u2019ll be ready and delivered to you tomorrow morning. Show your choker to any my employees and they\u2019ll get you what you need. Sleep here, sleep at The Sun, doesn\u2019t matter much to me.  If you need anything, any of the reagents you mentioned or traveling supplies, again, just give one of these employees a list before you sleep, and the items on the list will be delivered tomorrow morning. You might want to check in with the smith over at The Sun before you depart, but feel free to depart whenever you see fit.\u201dHaving curbed her concupiscence for the time being, she again turns to fix Jun with decidedly more demure look, \u201cDo you have any other inquires or requests of me?\u201d", "1461519092000": "Madame Naoki watches Jun leave with the very flattest of expressions. All of that time spent perfecting self control pays off once again, allowing Naoki to not commit a series of heinous crimes, and leaving the relative sanctity of Jun\u2019s holes intact for another day. When Naoki does speak, her tone is low, only barely audible enough for Artemis to hear. \u201cI swear, if she does that again, I\u2019ll not be so polite.\u201dWith that murmured, Madame Naoki wastes no time in departing the lounge into the back rooms, and from there, to who knows where.", "1465618479000": "As the evening is only beginning to get started, Madame Naoki arrives at The Moonlight Eclipse. With confident, leisurely steps, she approaches the door. Rather than identify herself to the doormen or introduce herself, Naoki simply makes a dismissive gesture in the direction of the door. At her motion, the doors spring open without any other visible intervention.An astute observer might notice that her earring, the amethyst in her right ear, has been glimmering for the past few minutes, and continues to quietly shine as she proceeds inside. The doormen pay Naoki and her party no heed as they enter, simply nodding respectfully. Once inside the lobby, Naoki ignores the small queue formed ahead of the host podium, instead opting to proceed around the room toward the rear of the establishment. Ducking under a stairwell, she proceeds through a hidden door that opens at her touch. Straightening once she\u2019s over the threshold, Madame Naoki continues on down the carpeted hallway that stretches before her. At irregular intervals, closed doors stand silently. Stopping- seemingly at random before one of these doors, Naoki pauses just for a moment before pushing it open and proceeding inside. Beyond the door, lamplight flickers dimly through the gauzy blue fabric of a curtain. When the curtain is pulled aside, a set of steps is revealed, leading down into a sunken dining area. A wide, flat couch, upholstered in blue velvet, rims the rectangular pit and encircles a simple wooden table. A bowl of assorted fruits has been placed in the center of the table. The couch is piled high all around with a variety of cushions and pillows, done up in purples, blues, blacks, and pearlescent silvers. Fabrics drape the walls, and hanging silver lamps illuminate the room. The soft sound of a woman singing filters quietly through the hangings, giving life to the soundscape of the room.Stopping off to one side, Naoki takes a moment to place her bow on a side-table, remove the quiver strapped to her thigh, and place it next to the bow. Rolling her shoulders, she makes her way over to the couch and seats herself, feet together, hands folded in lap. ", "1466154739000": "For as much as her air of casual indifference seems to say otherwise, one pointed ear fixed directly in Praxnihr\u2019s betrays to a keen observer how she hangs on each word, carefully absorbing and analysing each syllable. After he finishes speaking, Naoki waves her hand dismissively.\u201cA bit of evaluation never hurt anyone; high standards seem to be another thing we have in common. What she was intending to imply, though, is such that it has most probably been some time since y0u\u2019ve\u2026 crossed paths with an individual of equal or superior skill to your own.\u201dReaching to the bowl of fruit on the table, Naoki uses her thumb and forefinger to carefully pluck a grape from its bunch. Raising it to her eye for examination, she applies in what must be a well-practiced movement just the slightest amount of pressure, causing just the smallest bit of juice to leak from one end of the turgid fruit. \u201cWhich is understandable, of course. What I\u2019ve seen so far has been impressive.\u201dPopping the grape into her mouth, she chews thoughtfully for a moment, gazing off into the space above and slightly to the right of Praxnihr\u2019s face. However, her gaze drifts downward. Downward, and to the left, until her eyes are firmly fixed upon Prax\u2019s own, attempting to establish eye contact. When she speaks, her volume is comparable to a whisper, (and a rather sultry one at that) yet the sound permeates the space between them effortlessly. \u201cHowever. I\u2019m quite keen to see the rest.\u201dWithout breaking eye contact, Naoki\u2019s tail flickers in the direction of one of the room\u2019s many bits of furniture. A pole; a pillar, even. Perhaps three inches in diameter and made of polished wood, it is affixed both to the floor and fades up into the darkness that conceals the ceiling. A few of the room\u2019s curtains terminate into the pole, clipped into O-rings, though they are all far too up to interfere with what Naoki intends to suggest.", "1466532064000": "As Praxnihr's eyes meet her own and shift their hue, that familiar feeling again flares up betwixt Naoki\u2019s thighs. Along with this growing need, a flare of anger flares up, making itself visible in a crease between her eyebrows. Why must he be so slow? It wasn\u2019t as if she was subtle in her attempt for him to strip. And, in addition to those two lust-driven emotions, a small pang of fear grips Naoki. The touch of magic is unmistakable. Reminiscent of things she\u2019d really rather not remember. The onset of painful memories is nearly enough to rouse her, to break the silky smooth grip of the magic, but not quite. Only enough to make it uncomfortable as she rises from her seated position, a predatory grin spreading across her face. To Artemis, Naoki articulates the change in her plan. Subtlety be damned. If he won\u2019t take his pants off, I will.\u201cWell. I, for one, don\u2019t very much care for your clothes. Too silky for my taste. Too sheer. They\u2019ll need to go.\u201dUnable to bring herself to break eye contact, a long stride brings Naoki across the space between them to the bit of floor just before Prax. Reaching out, she places a hand on the hip of Praxnihr's pants. An aggressive, grabbing hand. One that makes it seem as if she\u2019s about to yank his trousers off, or else rip them. And indeed, this is her intention. ", "1468322993000": "Off in one corner of The Moonlight Eclipse, in such a way to be visible from the door but not obtrusively so, Madame Naoki has seated herself at a table. One of the low tables, one might note, wherein to seat one's self at it, one must first seat one's bottom upon a cushion upon the floor, which have been conveniently provided and arranged. Upon this potentiality auspicious occasion, Naoki has chosen to wear one of her red dresses. One of her strapless kimonos, even. With the detached sleeves and the ornate black hemming. Definitely not a garment to be running about in- lest it decide to malmalfunction, but the perfect sort of thing to... captivate the attention of her guests, she figures. On her cushion, she is seated, legs folded off to one side, feet bare, eyes shut, in an apparent state of meditation. Her ears swivel slowly, maintaining a strict watch over the soundscape of the Moonlight Eclipse. Her earring glimmers and flashes constantly,  presumably indicating activity. Off to Naoki's right,  Artemis  stands. Quietly. Unobtrusively. Very nearly another bit of furniture. (Not in the sense that she ought to be sat on- mind, but the sense that her presence doesn't call attention to itself. I would not advise sitting on her.)And, as such, Naoki waits. Presently,  guests to the summit ought to arrive. And when they do, she will be prepared to greet them.", "1468820031000": "Naoki opens her eyes as the pair approach, and nods her head in greeting after being introduced, \u201cA pleasure to meet you. And hello, Trisitan.\u201dShe gestures in the direction of the pillows, and waits as the pair of them seat themselves.\u201cLet me preface, you and the Aeadan people in general have my condolences.  What happened, despite any small victory in putting an end to the threat, was a capacity of hitherto unforeseen consequences and loss of life in the post-cataclysm world. Though it\u2019s one thing for me to look at estimates and try to wrap my head around figures, I cannot fathom how devastating the whole thing must have been from a perspective such as your own. If there\u2019s anything I can do. Any service or comfort I could offer to assist you, please don\u2019t hesitate to ask.\u201d\u201cHowever, unless you\u2019d really prefer to, let\u2019s not dwell on it, and instead turn our attention to matters of the present. Namely, the upcoming summit. As I hear, you\u2019d like to deliver an address, Miss Nyx. As one involved with organizing the event, I\u2019d like to inquire about it.\u201dShe intentionally does not inquire specifically, instead allowing Nyx to introduce the topic and expand upon it however she sees fit.", "1468890209000": "Listening to what Nyx has to say, and the line Tristian follows it up with, Naoki nods contemplatively, considering. The situation isn\u2019t quite what she expected, especially so with Tristian\u2019s not-quite-subtle comment, but remains workable.Having produced one of her gemstones from somewhere, Naoki idly rubs a bit of quartz between her thumb and forefinger as she responds, \u201cI see. A noble goal, and one that I am willing to support. Just a moment.\u201dRising from her cushion, Naoki stands, and takes a few paces over to a small set of cabinets sitting off to one side of the table. Opening one of the compartments, she pokes about inside before locating the item which she seeks: a rolled scroll. Holding it under one arm, she also selects a quill and a small bottle of ink from the top of the cabinet. After closing the door, she paces back to the table, and sets the ink and quill down in the center, before reseating herself on the cushion and unrolling the scroll. She spends just a moment to ensure that the scroll is the correct one, before sliding it across the table toward Nyx.\u201cThis is a contract. It states that the signee agrees not to disclose information classified as secret to The Black Tower. Before we can proceed, you\u2019ll need to sign it.\u201dWith that said, Naoki sits back slightly on her cushion, and rolls the bit of quartz from one hand to the other as she awaits a response.If Nyx were to examine the document, she would find what Naoki said to be true; the scroll is, indeed a non-disclosure agreement that prohibits the signee from sharing information related to The Black Tower.", "1468955966000": "Nodding slightly, Naoki takes the scroll, and spends a half-moment to ensure Nyx signed the document properly. Which she seems to have. Good. \u201cExcellent.\u201d Naoki does not further address Nyx\u2019s comment regarding the necessity of the document, because just then, a waiter arrives to their table. He seems to be a fair looking sort of gentleman, dressed in one of the regular suits with the little heliotrope bow-ties. Handsome, but not quite striking features, and a face that seems as if all of the skin was pulled back from the nose. Approaching their table, he first offers a small nod to its occupants before setting down a black, ceramic mug full of liquid at Naoki\u2019s spot.In return, she hands him the recently scroll, but not so much as a word more. He nods slightly, mostly to himself, and takes a moment to tuck it away inside his jacket before turning to the other two occupants of the table. His question is simple, \u201cDrinks?\u201d", "1469068790000": "The waiter nods and excuses himself, taking himself and his striking features somewhere else for a moment. Presumably to fetch Tristian\u2019s drink.After waiting a moment for the man to be out of earshot, Naoki continues, \u201cExcellent. Now, in regards to your proposal, here. You should be aware, first and foremost, that I am the ultimate authority behind The Black Tower. The circumstances by which I acquired it are somewhat strange, I inherited it, in a way, before I entered any public office. I realize that this is\u2026 perhaps a bit dubious, but speaking frankly, nobody else has the funds to maintain it, and it needs to exist, so I see that it does.\u201dShe pauses for a moment more, again considering Nyx\u2019s stated proposal.\u201cNow, let me repeat this back to you, to see if I understand correctly. What you\u2019d like to do here is essentially appeal to the nations of the world, and ask them very politely for lots of money so The Black Tower can maintain and utilize a fairly substantial standing army to further the same goals it already has? Or are you proposing something else, wherein the nations are asked to send portions of their own armies? Explain your plan in detail.\u201d", "1469230510000": "As Nyx finishes speaking, Naoki tilts her head to one side slightly, fixing Nyx with an incredulous gaze. Not based on what she said, mind you, but what she didn't say. Namely, absolutely no reaction to hearing Naoki- High Lady of Isra, responsible not only for Isra but all of its subsidiary territories, is the solitary financial support for The Black Tower, and maintains authority over the group in secret.Naoki had been expecting an outburst. Of rage, or confusion, or\u2026 something; something impassioned regarding the highly questionable practice in play. Failing that, a more tempered response. Perhaps a retraction of her proposal, upon learning that The Black Tower isn\u2019t nearly as neutral as it claims to be. Failing that, even the slightest acknowledgement of the fact would have sufficed.For gods\u2019 sakes, Naoki even used the phrase \u201cUltimate Authority\u201d! Did that not set off any red flags? Is she unaware of the significance of that fact, to which she has just been made privy to? This woman fancies herself a queen, but is apparently either politically inept or hard of hearing! Perhaps both.But that\u2019s fine, Naoki muses to herself. Nyx would just need to be placed in a position that appeals to her strengths. Leading armies and marshaling troops and strategizing, presumably, as opposed to anything even mildly related to the field of political intrigue. They'll make a good pair- these two, Naoki thinks. Their skills compliment well.\u00a0\u201cWell,\u201d Naoki begins, \u201cAssuming that Trisitan is fine with all this, I\u2019m willing to allow and negotiate such a thing. We should, however, hash out the specifics of your proposal  in advance before you take it before every civilized nation in the world and Goraia.\u201dWithout missing a beat, Naoki continues, \u201cThey\u2019ll want to see specifics before agreeing to anything; they would be fools not to. Having one pre-prepared example in advance will be instrumental in making your case, and will save us both work down the road. As for Isra accepting whatever the terms are, it\u2019ll have to go through the Assembly, but I\u2019m fairly confident it won\u2019t have any problems with my support.\u201dJust then, as if on cue, the waiter returns. In one gloved hand is Tristian\u2019s coffee, in a piping hot mug bearing the Midnight Sun logo. In the other is a small stack of drafting supplies. Some blank parchment, a few quills, and a bottle of ink. All of these items are placed before Tristian, in a silent signal that he is to do the drafting. Naoki sits silently and takes the first sip of her own drink- which smells vaguely of cinnamon, and waits for either some manner of response or for Tristian to begin putting the terms of the proposed proposal on paper.", "1469490746000": "As Nyx speaks her bit, Naoki shifts a bit on her pillow, intending to express her doubt nonverbally. Nyx\u2019s proposed plan would seem to have a few holes in it. \u201cHm. That all seems reasonable enough, but I see a few issues with your proposed plan. First and foremost, I think it might be somewhat foolhardy to rely on your \u2018wealth\u2019 from The White City. Those are funds, not income. To use them as upkeep will mean that they\u2019ll run out, and then we\u2019ll be facing budget problems. It would be better to invest that silver, or keep it as an emergency fund.\u201d\u201cSecondly, allow me to say this. I have appointed Trisitan here as head of The Black Tower. How this all is implemented, and which nations to include or disclude- that\u2019s his choice to make. All I intend to do here is ensure that what he\u2019s going to do is reasonable enough, and give my advice. And it\u2019d seem like he\u2019s got something to say regarding including Goraia.\u201dTilting her head slightly to one side, Naoki gives Tristian a somewhat expectant look, inviting him to speak his mind.  ", "1469664573000": "Naoki nods solemnly as Tristian speaks his bit. She had invited him to speak his mind- and he did, and made his stance very clear, but she thought he might have more to say. It was an invitation to vent to two people who would be sympathetic, and he chose not to take it. The silencing runes would have kept his words private, as so long as he didn\u2019t stand up. Perhaps she should have clarified that more visibly. Tristian doesn\u2019t have much experience with these, she realizes. Or perhaps he just didn\u2019t feel as if he could speak the extent of his mind before the two of them. It\u2019s difficult to tell, Naoki muses. Regardless, she continues speaking after Nyx is finished, \u201cFair enough, then. Just remember to keep a record of each transaction and reevaluate your budget often. Otherwise you\u2019ll be kicking yourself later. We can speak again about the specifics of the logistics and The Black Tower\u2019s budget after we know which countries with be participating, and to what degrees.\u201dFor a moment or so, she simply sits, reviewing the conversation that just transpired in her mind\u2019s eye and considering if there might be anything else to say or do right now. It wouldn\u2019t seem so. She articulates as much by fixing the pair sitting across from her with an inquisitive look that seems to say, \u201cDo you have anything else to add or discuss?\u201d", "1469777425000": "Naoki nods slowly, appearing to digest what Nyx just said. After a half-moment, she speaks, \u201cSomeone on your end will have to speak with the recently promoted High Commodore Finch, both regarding her accepting your men and tackling the logistical aspects behind the transfer, but I have no issues with what you\u2019re proposing.\u201d\u201cI assume you\u2019ll be continuing to stay with Tristian, so I\u2019ll not worry about your accommodations or any of that. If you need to speak with me for whatever reason, he\u2019s got a direct line, as it were. We\u2019ve got these fun little gemstones we use for telepathy, actually.\u201d She gestures to her earring, flicking her ear for emphasis. \u201cIncredibly useful, I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll show you as part of the initiation process.\u201d", "1470151302000": "Taking Nyx\u2019s comment in stride, Naoki shrugs slightly, and takes another sip of her drink before responding, \u201cWell, conquering the world would be a bit of a hassle, is all. You\u2019ve got to weigh the ratios, and as things stand, it wouldn\u2019t be profitable, or even worth the effort, as I see it. I\u2019ll let Dutch know your man is on his way, though.\u201dAs she\u2019s speaking, true to word, her earring glimmers slightly, presumably with the aforementioned notification. Additionally, taking her mug in one hand, she begins to stand from her cushion. \u201cI think that would about conclude our business for now, though. Unless either of you have anything more, I\u2019m going to go greet the Gauldish delegation. Miss Nyx, it was a pleasure to meet you, and I look forward to working with you in the future. Tristian\u2026\u201dShe trails off, seemingly hesitant, but in actuality taking a moment to study Tristian, still buried in the paperwork as is he is. What is he even writing\u2026? He\u2019s far outpaced the content of their discussion. Perhaps he\u2019s doing the math. Perhaps he\u2019s still boiling with that righteous rage of his, trying to hide it. Quietly, she realizes that she doesn\u2019t actually have anything particularly excellent to say to Trisitan just now. She doesn\u2019t have a good enough read on him at the moment. Biting her lip slightly out of frustration, she opts to choose a phrase that ought to be more or less universally applicable. \u201cTake it easy,\u201d she offers, not entirely satisfied. Offering a small wave to them both, Naoki turns on her heel to depart, leaving the pair of them at the table. ", "1479936684000": "Beyond the curtain (which is parted easily enough), Quis would find a sort of cubby depressed into the wall, large enough to comfortably hold a semi-circular wooden table, whose flat side is parallel to the wall, and a similarly shaped booth seat, which encircles the table and provides seating for the two women seated at it. To the left, Alliandre Saleia is seated. Her polearm rests against the wall to her side. Directly ahead, seated in the center of the table, sits the distinctive, catlike figure of Madame Naoki, whose signet ring, unique ears, and tail mark her as the genuine article. This evening, she seems to have chosen to wear a red, peplumed blouse. Before her on the table, there is a collection of neatly stacked papers, an ink bottle, and a small book covered in red leather, which is open. Using a quill, she seems to be writing in the book until such point as Quis parts the curtains and enters, whereupon she glances up, over the top of the book to see who it might be. However, this does not allow her to see whoever it is that entered. Only after she lowers the book completely is she able to see over and spot Quis. \u201cAh! Hello. I presume you\u2019re here about the advertisement I posted. Have a seat.\u201d She gestures toward the right side of the table. ", "1479943178000": "As Quis seats herself and begins, Naoki quirks one eyebrow and bites at her lip, honestly surprised and somewhat incredulous that this minute woman doesn\u2019t know who she is. She must be one of those eccentric wizard sorts, Naoki thinks. Probably locked herself away in a library for the past three years, or something along those lines. Perhaps a victim of amnesia, or memory tampering. To Naoki, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any other explanation for this woman not knowing her name, for it is known the world over and then some, to the point where deities and demigods of other realms know of her.But that\u2019s fine. With only a hint of exasperation, Naoki responds, \u201cI am High Lady Naoki, ruler of Isra and Empress of The Free States. Incidentally, I also own this establishment.\u201dWith a lazy wave of her hand, Naoki gestures to the room around them and the establishment at large, hoping that that introduction will perhaps inspire a tad of respect from Quis here. Without missing a beat, she continues, \u201cIn regards to the flyer and my quest\u2026\u201dAs she speaks, Naoki shuts the book she was writing in and slides it off to her right, towards Alli. From the stack of papers, she pulls a blank one and begins to take her quill to it, sketching some manner of image. \u201cIt has come to my attention that there seems to be a race of civilized peoples that have, up until very recently, been completely isolated from the known world. Unknown to the known world, and presumably unknowing of it.\u201dIt would seem as if Naoki is sketching a map of the world on the paper, with Isra in the center left, Gauldin and Alban not pictured, and the northernmost reaches of the continent visible at the top of the map. \u201cI, being the sort of curious person I am, would like to know of it. Of its people, culture, and government. The language they speak and the goods they make, everything about the land and the people who inhabit it. However, seeing as how next to nothing is known about this land, and it\u2019s a long voyage from here to there, going myself to see first-hand would be impractical and ill-advised. Instead, I intend to pay an individual- presumably you, to go to this land, and learn of it for me.\u201dHaving finished with her map, Naoki places an \u201cX\u201d mark on the area where the land supposedly exists, off the northeastern coast of the primary continent, in a spot which necessitates either a voyage to the far north, to cut across the top or a longer voyage south down around the continent. \u201cFor me, and the world at large, even. Expanding the borders of the known world, if you will. While there isn\u2019t much fun or use in cartographing empty stretches of forest, properly discovering a new nation is quite substantial, in my opinion, and that\u2019s what I would like to pay you to do.\u201dAfter tapping on the X-mark for emphasis, Naoki slides the hand drawn map over toward Quis, for her perusal. ", "1479954046000": "\u201cWell..\u201d Naoki trails off for a moment before continuing, \u201cThe rumors I\u2019ve heard would seem to say that the inhabitants of the landmass in question are humans of some variety. Exotic, perhaps, but most likely not radically unlike anything the world has ever seen.\u201d\u201cIn any case, assuming that you are able to complete the task to my satisfaction, I intend to compensate you for your efforts with gold equivalent to this sum\u2026\u201d Again, she trails off, turning to write a figure on another bit of paper. The figure is a fairly substantial one, a modestly sized fortune. Enough to retire on and live comfortably, but not quite enough to make one wealthy to the point of absurdity. \u201cOr, if you\u2019d prefer, I have the ability to compensate by other means.\u201d With this, Naoki slides Quis a look that could be construed as lecherous before resuming her businesslike demeanor. \u201cSuch as, for example, property, knowledge, or perhaps employment. It\u2019s up to you, really, I have the ability to grant more or less anything one might desire - within reason.\u201d", "1479960510000": "Raising an eyebrow, Naoki looks on. This is a very curious sort of person, this Quis. For a moment, she appears to consider something, but dismisses it. That\u2019s beyond \u2018within reason\u2019. \u201cWell, that depends on what you\u2019ll need. Tell me about your vessel. Do you have any crew for it?\u201d", "1479973649000": "Nodding slowly as Quis speaks her bit, Naoki spends a moment to consider before responding, \u201cWell, that all seems fine enough, but I feel like I should clarify...\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t intend this to be an official matter. Officially, Isra is unaware of this supposed landmass, and any beings that may live upon it. If this were to be an official matter, it would be considered by The Conclave and The Assembly, and would probably result in an embassy being sent over via one or more of our warships. But that process would take a while, and may not even result in action being taken - politicians are hesitant to take action based on rumors alone, and understandably so. Further, if it turns out this nation is not only real, but hostile, with a superior navy to whatever we decide to send over, Isra would be out several warships, hundreds of sailors, and a diplomatic embassy.\u201d\u201cAs such, I intend to use you, a private citizen, unaffiliated with any nation, as a scout. There\u2019s no reason I cannot make a deal with a private citizen asking them to accomplish a task, as so long as the citizen in question can\u2019t be construed as a privateer or mercenary. So you, a private explorer, will go investigate, and obtain as much information as you can for me, which I will then be able to make decisions based on.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not going to ask for any particular sort of information beyond the very basics, but you should obtain as much as you can. Things like the local name of the nation and state, what system of governance it uses, what the land is like would be basic bits of information that would be useful. If you can purchase or otherwise obtain items such as books, art, weapons, or other objects of their culture, that would be nice. If any of the locals would like to come back with you, I can\u2019t very well tell you how to run your ship.\u201d With this, she offers a shrug, intending to express that she\u2019s more or less indifferent on the matter. \u201cHowever, I would rather that you not take any actions that might make future diplomatic relations troublesome. Even though you aren\u2019t to be an official representative of Isra, you will be their first impressions of our continent\u2019s people. You should put thought and discretion into your actions as to attempt to make a favorable impression.\u201d", "1480018025000": "Shaking her head to indicate the negative, Naoki responds simply, \u201cNot yet. The number of individuals who own a ship, get to decide what to do with it, and would be willing to risk it on a venture like this is a relatively small one. The majority of captains are either part of Isra\u2019s Navy or merchants, sailing the Sea Lanes between Port Silverion and Bayonne - a shorter and well-guarded voyage.\u201dWith this, Naoki lapses back into silence, presuming that Quis has more to say or ask. ", "1480035309000": "Though she raises an eyebrow at Quis\u2019 choice of words, Naoki doesn\u2019t make a point of it, instead answering the prompt with a question, \u201cWhat is the name of your ship, and when do you intend to depart?\u201d", "1480061423000": "Nodding solidly, Naoki acknowledges Quis yet again. That\u2019s a fairly normal and respectable thing, she thinks. However, in regards to the question, she spends another moment in thought before responding, \u201cWell. In terms of mercenaries, I have made good employees out of the best I've come across, or so I would like to think. It isn\u2019t particularly often that I require the services of a mercenary, either. Easier, faster, and more reliable to send a Sun Marshal.\u201dAfter another sort pause of consideration, she continues, \u201cHowever, there is one that I am aware of, one Feru din Narith . I met her by chance on a recent excursion to Gauldin, and though I did not have a chance to observe her skills as a fighter, she seemed fairly competent, and mentioned possibly visiting Isra. If she does happen to be around -- perhaps at one of the local taverns, I think that she would most likely make a fine addition to your crew. Though I would prefer it if you bring her back in one piece. She and I have\u2026 unfinished business.\u201d As opposed to the dark and possibly malicious tone that might usually accompany such a statement, Naoki\u2019s tone borders on sensuous. One could guess at what sort of business she might be referring to, but Naoki does not elaborate further on the matter. ", "1480240858000": "Though not reluctant to spend the day with Skarlet, her deflection of a seemingly innocent enough inquiry leaves Naoki with some amount of suspicion. This suspicion is further fueled at the end of the day, but without anything in particular to support her suspicions, Naoki takes no action other than sleeping somewhat uneasily.The following morning, Naoki arrives at The Moonlight Eclipse with the intention of eating there and then proceeding to The Citadel to begin her work day. Skarlet\u2019s note finds Naoki just as she\u2019s about to begin breakfast, which happens to be cubed ham served with honey and a loaf of warm bread. It only takes Naoki a moment to read the note, but in that second, her appetite is ruined. Following a very brief but intense burst of anger, Naoki bites her lip and begins to contemplate her next move, not quite so quick to accept this development as it has been thrust upon her.Assuming that the ship didn\u2019t depart in the night (Passage in and out of Port Silverion is heavily restricted from dusk until dawn),  it couldn't possibly be very far. A skilled captain, of which the navy has a fair few, perhaps with the assistance of a few of the Enclave\u2019s wind mages, could easily catch up to whatever sort of dingy that Electrum woman purchased. Or it the ship had departed the previous night, overtaking it might be a bit troublesome, but not for a Gauldish airship, which Naoki feels confident in her ability to secure the services of- given the favors she has done the Gauldish royal family in the past, and the cordial relations between their respective countries. Failing even that, some manner of agreement might be able to be worked out with the \u2018Sea Queen\u2019 being Jun liaised with on the topic of the Isra - Gauldin Sea Lanes as they were being established.However, just as she places a finger on her earring with the intention to start issuing mobilization orders, Naoki pauses- frozen in place. It is at this point that she stops to think -- to question if she should act so hastily.The first answer that jumps to mind, is \u2018Yes\u2019. It\u2019s very nice and all that Skarlet has a desire to grow as a person, but there are ways to grow as a person without traveling hundreds of miles by sea to investigate a shady rumor of a completely unknown civilization! Of all of the things that one could possibly do, that it, as far as Naoki is concerned, one of the single most dangerous things, simply based on the number of unknown variables. The enhanced physiology of a vampire doesn\u2019t help very much against such perils as storms, shipwrecks, or monsters of the deep. The seas off the northern coast are -- if one would believe the tales of seadogs, among the most dangerous to be found, as far as perils and monsters and such go.  Beyond that, there is no guarantee that the land in question even exists. Naoki knew, when she posted the flyer, and when she spoke with Quis, that the task was very possibly a wild goose chase. If it indeed doesn\u2019t exist, the ship\u2019s crew and Skarlet would be left in the open ocean, with a questionable amount of supplies and an equally long journey back. Depending on how much fresh water Quis choose to take along, the crew dying of dehydration at sea is a very real possibility. And, while Naoki supposes that Skarlet would have the opposite problem, Naoki doubts Skarlet\u2019s ability to captain the vessel alone back to anywhere in particular.Furthermore, if the land in question does exist, and there are indeed beings living upon it, there is still no guarantee that they will be friendly. Most sorts of humans aren\u2019t, on the whole. Naoki can\u2019t even bring herself to speculate about that possibility, resting her elbows on the table and planting her chin in one palm. For a while, she simply sits as such. Silently, attempting to clear her mind. After a moment, she glances down to read the note again. Please don't worry about me. Naoki scoffs and slaps the tabletop, in that moment more irritated by the note\u2019s final sentence than its premise. It\u2019s somewhat insulting, she thinks. What sort of self-respecting parental figure would be able to do such a thing in this situation?After another moment, Naoki moves to rest her face in one hand and balls the other into a fist, tapping her knuckles on the tabletop slowly. Again, she attempts to approach the situation rationally and this time, arrives at a conclusion.Naoki resolves to proceed back to The Midnight Sun, where Skarlet\u2019s supply of blood is primarily stored. She will check to see how much is missing from the expected inventory -- how much Skarlet took with her. Then, based on how much that turns out to be and Skarlet\u2019s average rate of consumption (data which Naoki already has), she will then infer how long Skarlet\u2019s supply will last. With this information, Naoki will prepare a team or several of Sun Marshals to go seek out Skarlet as her supply ought to be very nearly reaching its end. That team would then either resupply Skarlet with more blood or retrieve her. Additionally, Naoki intends to go speak with Takhana Veil  as soon as possible, and request that she utilize her talents of scrying to keep a magical eye on Skarlet. She will observe, and the deployment of the team will be hastened if Skarlet appears to be in peril.This, Naoki thinks, is a very reasonable plan. It strikes a fair balance between being protective and overbearing, which is the sort of balance she supposes she ought to be striking in a matter such as this, and having a plan calms her to a degree. Still, her appetite cannot be recovered. Abruptly sliding her seat backward, Naoki stands and stalks from the room and then from the Moonlight Eclipse as a whole, Skarlet\u2019s note clenched in one hand. Breakfast and her duties to the state can wait.", "1489670193000": "Upon this beautiful afternoon that Ms. Ganymede Gala has chosen to grace The Moonlight Eclipse with her presence, Lady Naoki is sitting quietly with Alliandre Saleia at a small table not far from the main entryway, enjoying her lunch. As the closest location to The Citadel where cooks trained personally by Maelik practice their craft, there isn\u2019t anywhere else comparable to eat. Unless, of course, she\u2019d like to walk all the way over to the Sun, but nobody wants to do that, so on days such as these when she can make the time to, Naoki often chooses to have her meals here. Today\u2019s entree is some manner of spicy soup, containing noodles and cheese. Lady Naoki is rather enjoying it, but her attention is drawn away by The Eclipse\u2019s latest visitor. Ah, my latest populist policy, in person.Naoki\u2019s interactions with Ganymede up until this point have been somewhat limited, especially considering that Naoki was primarily responsible for appointing the woman to her position. Which isn\u2019t to say that Naoki hasn\u2019t seen Ganymede, because who hasn\u2019t. But the official talks and such relating to Ganymede\u2019s appointment were brief and were done through proxies, so Naoki has yet to meet and speak with the woman properly. There is an appointment scheduled, but it isn\u2019t for a while, yet. Perhaps it would prove to be unnecessary. Whatever the case may turn out to be, though, it seems as if Naoki will have at least a short while longer to continue enjoying her lunch, so she proceeds to do so. @calico might be around, she muses. It\u2019d be amusing to see his feathers ruffled, as Ganymede seems like the type who might.", "1489996849000": "Some jackass seemed to have scraped the hell out of the seat she was sitting in, and it kept poking her with splinters, so she had scooched a tad closer to Naoki than was strictly necessary. Alli was in a prime mood this afternoon, having spent the majority of it outside in such beautiful weather, something sure to put anyone in a good mood. She hummed happily along to a tune whose lyrics she had long ago forgotten, pausing only to take sips of the special, a rather delightfully spicy soup.The presence of Ganymede drew a bit of a stir from the people in the place, something that didn't happen when Naoki entered any more. That thought drew an amused snicker from the woman, interrupting her humming.Hm. Questions for Calico. Fair enough, she supposes, fair enough. Naoki isn\u2019t in any particular rush to speak with Ganymede in any case. She\u2019ll throw her parties with her budget, and hopefully, brighten a significant number of days in the process. That\u2019s enough for now. Returning her attention to her immediate situation, Naoki turns her head slightly in Alli\u2019s direction and quirks an eyebrow. What\u2019s she snickering about? After a couple of quick glances about don\u2019t reveal the source of Alli\u2019s amusement, Naoki decides that she\u2019ll resume her meal. Smirking slightly to herself, Naoki sets back into her soup, as if nothing had happened, and nothing, in particular, is going on. Yet, something\u00a0in particular must be going on, because something is slithering its way between Alli\u2019s lower back and the seat. It seems small, about as wide around as one\u2019s index finger, but long, twisting, and perhaps a bit squishy. It appears to have originated from Naoki, or at least her side of the seat.Unless Alli takes sudden action, two more would join the first, and together they would continue across her lower back and then slightly beyond that, to curve part of the way around her hip. Almost like resting a hand on one\u2019s shoulder, but tentacles and hips instead of hands and shoulders. From here, they move no further, seemingly content. Were Alli to glance down, she would be able to see them. They are, indeed, tentacles, and seem to be of the pale skinned, smooth, and featureless variety. Each of the three appears to be just the same as its fellows, and they look almost like fingers\u00a0- if fingers lacked nails and joints. The rounded tips seem to have a bit of fuzz on them, but that's about all one can say in describing the things.Meanwhile, Naoki is quietly eating her meal. Were Alli to cast a look in her direction, Naoki would look back with the sort of warm smile that might seem to convey, \u201cI\u2019m enjoying your company,\u201d or something to a similar extent.", "1490212734000": "For her actions, Alli is rewarded with a bit of quiet chuckling as Naoki readies her next spoonful of soup. The tentacles withdraw immediately, back up under the hem of Naoki\u2019s blouse from whence they came. Were Alli to continue holding the first one pinned to the back of the seat back, it would tug, attempting to free itself, and if Alli seems unwilling to release it, it would only sit there for the time being. After finishing with that portion of soup, Naoki elaborates, still chuckling a bit to herself, \u201cI was going to give you something better to laugh about, is all.\u201d To clarify, she raises one hand in Alli\u2019s and waggles her fingers in a motion one might use in tickling, intending to imply that the tentacles\u2019 purpose was as benign as that. Relatively benign considering the context, at least. In hindsight, Naoki supposes that she should have gone for the closer of Alli\u2019s two armpits to make that intention clear, considering her reputation.Regardless, it doesn\u2019t seem as if Naoki is upset or particularly interested in fooling with Alliandre further at the moment. She had her giggle and has now resumed her meal. ", "1490538647000": "Having decided that she\u2019s also finished with her soup, Lady Naoki utilizes a single finger to slide the bowl forward to the center of the table to signify as much. Leaning back, Naoki shakes her head slightly in response to Alliandre\u2019s statement.\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say so. It\u2019s nice to be looked at, but not all the time. There is a thrill to be found in being watched and looked upon with admiration and respect and all that, but the scrutiny gets tiring quickly. If I had any inclination to, I could have made a grand entrance, sat us somewhere excessively extravagant, with a whole team of wait staff and an eight-course meal. I haven\u2019t properly treated you yet here, have I\u2026\u201dAs she\u2019s describing this, Naoki slides the rest of the way over toward Alli, leaning into her while making wide, sweeping gestures with her opposite arm.  \u201cIn constructing this place, no expense was spared. It\u2019s not advertised, but in addition to the eating and such, there are what amount to inn rooms upstairs. Beds stuffed with harpy feathers, all of the master crafted furniture, some of the same treated wood used up at The Chalet, all of it; the works. While the Summit was underway, the other world leaders stayed here, and - not that I had anyone spying on them or anything like that - their entourage mentioned in a few instances that the accommodations here were far superior to those back wherever they came from.\u201d\u201cAnd the cooks! I\u2019ve got to tell you about the cooks, and Maelik, but I\u2019ve just realized that I\u2019ve gone completely off topic. \u2026\u201dFollowing this realization, it doesn\u2019t seem as if Naoki is quite sure what to say; her train of thought has derailed and lost sight of the track. Her gesticulating hand comes down to rest on her lap, and the tip of her tail, which is hanging off the seat, begins to twitch at irregular intervals.

If you will pardon my wording for a moment and excuse me for being so vague, I have an awful lot of awful things to remember and consider, and just there I thought about a fair number of them all at once. \u2026 I\u2019ve never done that in quite that manner before, and I would not like to do it again.\u201dGrumbling a bit to herself, Naoki leans up off the seat and takes a long drag of whatever it is that they use to fill her mug. Having drained the cup, she slides it down the table such that the wait staff may take it again. Immediately afterward, she turns back to Alli. \u201cIn any case, I think we are done here.\u201d This seems simply like a statement, as opposed to a suggestion. Naoki makes no movement and doesn\u2019t look as if she is going to move, either. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what to do with the rest of today,\u201d she states flatly.", "1491168219000": "In response to Alli\u2019s suggestion, Naoki murmurs noncommittally.

For instance, sometime before tomorrow night, unless I review the proposed budgets before tomorrow evening, things like The Guard won\u2019t receive any money.  Things like that. I would say I have flexibility, as opposed to free time.\u201dLeaning incrementally closer, Naoki whispers, \u201cIt isn\u2019t often a question of what.\u201dAs if nothing has happened, she moves back and continues. \u201cI spend most of my time socially,\u201d she says, gesturing toward the table.\u201cAnd when I find the time, I read. One must always continue their education, as I see it. I also practice archery casually, and that\u2019s enough combined with imperial obligations to wear me out.\u201d\u201cI would ask the same of you. \u2026 Beyond meditating, that is.\u201d", "1491421554000": "Listening, Naoki nods appreciatively. She\u2019s quite correct. Idly, she wonders if Alli frequents any of the botanical stores around Isra, or if she collects her ingredients personally. This serves as a reminder that she really ought to introduce Alli to Kate sometime soon. Regardless, Naoki doesn\u2019t have any verbal comments to offer on the matter.\u201cBut it was the head of the Guard who created the budget proposal. It is both my personal policy and my responsibility as Minister of Finance to keep a watchful eye on every bit of gold passing into and out of the Treasury. If I let all of the minor authorities take as much as they wanted from the Treasury, there wouldn\u2019t be anything left at the end of the day.\u201dFor the space of a few moments, Naoki pauses, crossing her arms across her chest and staring idly off into space in front of her.\u201cSomeone once said,\u201d she begins, \u201cHe who holds the purse strings, rules the house, the nation, the world.\u201dAfter allowing that to sink in for a few moments, she continues, \u201cKeeping hold of the purse strings as it were is rather important, as I see it. So I review the budgets and manage the nation\u2019s finances personally. It\u2019s not difficult for me, and I can sleep soundly at night knowing that each coin is going where it ought to.\u201d\u201cAs far as the rest of today is concerned, the budgets will take three or four hours. I could do them now and have the rest of the night open, or put them off for a while yet, as there isn\u2019t anything planned for tonight.

For as blas\u00e9 as Alli is concerning matters of the 'casual' categorization, talking about having a date seems to not be quite as easy for her. Beyond idly speculating why this might be the case, Naoki also begins to wonder about whom the date may be. Figuring that Alli will reach out if she\u2019d like to talk, Naoki opts not to pry.\u201cIn that case, consider the time between this moment and the schedules meetings tomorrow evening yours. I think I\u2019m going to proceed directly back to The Chalet, and finish what needs to be done there.\u201dWhat Alli might need all of that time for precisely, Naoki does not specify verbally, but it\u2019s not very hard to infer how she thinks Alli\u2019s date might go, given her tone of voice and confident smirk.", "1491885062000": "\u201cHmmh,\u201d remarks Naoki, mildly surprised.

If he\u2019s got balls like that, Alli\u2019s going to be in for a real treat tonight, Naoki thinks. But regardless, it seems as if Alli has some unresolved thoughts on the matter, so Naoki ignores the question to ask one of her own instead, \u201cAnd what does he look like?\u201dShifting herself, Naoki places her elbow onto the table and rests the side of her face against her closed fist, to give Alliandre her undivided attention and be as receptive as she can. Though she isn't entirely certain what sort of light the other woman sees her in, Naoki feels it best to listen, and offer what she can.\u00a0", "1492383110000": "Apr 12, 2017 4:08:03 GMT -8 Alliandre Saleia said:She blushed a tad, Naoki was certainly right about his brazen attitude. Most of the soldiers and sailors had been intimidated by her, either her stature or her position. \"He's tan, from Sakand I believe, but immigrated to Isra, above average height but still smaller than say...Knight-Captain Calgary. Dark hair and brown eyes, charming smile, and incredibly confident.\" She had only spoken to him a few times, just idle chatter as Alli waited for Naoki to finish whatever she was doing at the time.As she listens, Naoki smiles to herself. Brown eyes. Alli noticed the color of his eyes; she\u2019s definitely into him as if the rest of what she has to say isn\u2019t confirmation enough. What will remain to be seen, however, is if Mr. Browneyes Bigballs truly means anything with this date of his, or if he merely intends to flash his charming smile, whisper a few sweet nothings in her ear, and buy Alli a few stiff drinks before taking her somewhere secluded.Of course, in this case, considering that the fellow is a Dawn Rider serving aboard The Depravity, these are all but certainly worst intentions he could have. The worse intentions he would dare have. And having already had the pleasure, Naoki can hardly blame him. In fact, it was Naoki\u2019s hope to demonstrate her newfound tentacular talents to Alli tonight, but such things can wait. Naoki nods knowingly. \u201cI think I know who you mean, there aren\u2019t many Sakandi men integrated into Isra yet, to begin with, and I doubt there is more than one Dawn Rider aboard The Depravity. \u2026 Come to think of it; I haven\u2019t had a Sakandi man yet. You\u2019ll have to let me know what it\u2019s like.\u201d Smirking, Naoki aims a teasing poke toward Alli\u2019s midsection, hoping to elicit another blush.

Jax, ever the professional, shows Naoki his palm, waving it off. He moves off to the side, out of the door\u2019s path. Naoki seems unsatisfied with this resolution; she hit him pretty hard, someone should look at it. But, she supposes, he\u2019ll handle it himself, and other matters require her attention. Passing through the threshold, Naoki steps down into the street and turns about to look back toward the carriage. The children would likely be swift to follow.

Inside, the lobby of The Moonlight Eclipse seems to be mostly empty. It\u2019s before anyone would reasonably be eating lunch, so the only customers are those visiting for brunch or for purely social reasons - of which there are not many.

Staff meander this way and that, carrying platters and cleaning supplies, preparing for the rest of the day.As Naoki's group crosses the threshold, they're greeted with a bow from the doorman, an older gentleman in a fine suit. Upon straightening, he does a poor job of covering his double-take. He had not been informed that The Empress would be visiting today, and he had not been informed that she had\u2026 that there were\u2026 children. That one looks just like her! How did this happen? It is within the purview of his duties to know every notable person and occurrence there is to know; how could this have slipped past him? Why hasn\u2019t this been announced? Why hasn't anyone mentioned- there must be some mistake, did he miss- *SNAP*Naoki snaps her fingers to draw his attention.

It lives up to its name, indeed. A nautical theme is at play, featuring a beautiful fresco on the ceiling depicting sea life in soft pastels. A giant ship\u2019s wheel is mounted on one of the walls, and similar nautical knickknacks are present throughout. The table is one long and thin, running diagonally through the center of the room.

I\u2019d like you all to follow me; we\u2019re going to walk.\u201dThe child lucky enough to be seated on Naoki\u2019s left, Moonflower, gets to come along as Naoki stands, to be picked up and carried. A step ahead, Naoki thinks. It doesn't seem a selection or an act of favoritism because it makes the most sense to pick up the one on the left. But Naoki placed Moonflower on the left intentionally, for just such a reason as that! To pick her up and prevent her from exploring every nook of The Eclipse. High-level child care skills right here, Naoki thinks, pleased with her small victory.In any case, before long, the door is opened, and Naoki leads the way out, down the hall. After a short distance, she turns around to confirm that all of the children are in tow and Ms. Higgs is covering the rear. She then leads the group through The Moonlight Eclipse, into the back, through a few doors. It only takes a short time to reach their apparent destination, a door - a somewhat large door, sitting all by itself in an otherwise inconspicuous hallway. Whereas The Eclipse\u2019s doorframes have been wood up until this point, this frame seems to be stone. Very smooth, whitish stone, not dissimilar to marble. Further, the door itself appears to be made of the same stuff. In place of a knob or lock, there is only a small handle for one to pull, and it is entirely unlabeled.Stopping just outside the door, Naoki turns about to do another check, to make sure all are present and in order before moving on. ", "1508297945000": "Finding all in order, Naoki sets Moonflower gently on the ground before turning toward the door. Pulling it open casually, she peers through, as if she\u2019s unsure of what\u2019s beyond. However, all is in order on that account as well, so she nods to herself.With a gesture, Big Naoki beckons Little Naoki to turn about before picking her picking her up under the elbows and lifting her up onto her shoulders. This creates a Stack of Naokies, through the uncultured might refer to it merely as a \u2018piggyback ride.'\u201cYou be careful with my ears, you,\u201d Big Naoki says, partially teasing, partially stern. Once she\u2019s confident her passenger is secure, Naoki bends slightly to avoid bonking any heads as she leads the way through the door.On the other side of the door, there seems to be a perfectly straight, endless hallway. A wide hall, almost wide enough for everyone to walk parallel. It\u2019s furnished finely, with quality wood polished to a finish, tasteful red paint, and an improbably long carpet stretching off into the distance, toward the point of the one-point perspective that is this hallway. Candles hang in ornate sconces on the right-hand wall and only the right-hand wall; these too seem innumerable. Big Naoki holds the door open for the rest of the group to file through before releasing it. The door closes itself without any visible means of doing so, and when it shuts, it shuts with a certain sense of finality.Silence, if permitted to, would set in immediately. Through the halls of The Eclipse, there was the ambient noise of people moving, working, cooking, and so on. Here, all of that is gone. The air seems to hang; it\u2019s stale, not circulating.\u201cAlright then,\u201d Naoki says, quickly breaking the silence, \u201cThis way. Stay close, and don\u2019t walk backward.\u201dHer hands hanging down to be held, Naoki puts the door at her back and starts to walk, as if all is normal and well. Hopefully, before anyone can get too creeped out, she voices a follow-up question, \u201cSo. What else would you all like to do today?\u201d", "1509146962000": "\u201cIt is magic, yes,\u201d Naoki calmly responds, continuing down the corridor.\u201cThe candles are only on one side, so you know which way you\u2019re going. Otherwise, you could get turned around. \u2026 It won\u2019t take long to reach the end, though. Look, you can see it, down the hall, there.\u201d Naoki gestures, pointing down the hallway in front of them. However, there isn\u2019t anything to see. No matter how much squinting anyone would see is the hallway, stretching on to infinity. Naoki\u2019s true objective is to get all the eyes looking down the corridor. If she\u2019s able to have everyone looking straight ahead for as much as a moment\u2026That\u2019ll activate the magic. After allowing several moments for everyone to look, Naoki turns a clean 180 to start walking backward, hoping to see their destination. If it worked, the hallway would end some ten meters behind them, in a door much like the one they entered by, but obviously another. The door would- hopefully, be a dark slate gray, with a small sign reading \u201c1.\u201dRegardless of if the magic worked or not, Naoki would continue to walk backward silently, leaving someone else to catch on. ", "1509327040000": "Naoki smirks, satisfied with her execution. Though far from the fastest method of supernatural transport available, this one is among the least jarring; all of the fun stuff happens outside the perception of the traveler. Better than spending half the day in a carriage and better than cleaning up regurgitated apples.\u201cWelcome to,\u201d Naoki says, passing through the door\u2026", "1516155189000": "Lady Naoki enters not through the front door but instead approaches Lady Venus from within the establishment. For this outing, Naoki has chosen to wear one of her many sweaterdresses.  In comparison to some of its peers, this one is unremarkable. It is black, and fits snugly. Little else can be said. It is a garment that adds little to its wearer, but doesn\u2019t distract, either.Coming up to where she was told Venus is seated, Naoki raises one hand to give a finger-wiggling wave. She then gestures for Venus to follow her back the way she came. \u201cThere\u2019s a place in the back,\u201d she explains.

The waiter, making a note of these things, nods, and excuses himself off down the stairs.This leaves Venus and Naoki on the balcony, the table between them lit by the soft candlelight of the chandelier hanging above. Resting her elbows on the table, Naoki steeples her fingers and considers the woman sitting across the table. Lady Venus. A higher demon, hailing from a plane previously unknown. Similar in some respects to other demons Naoki\u2019s dealt with, but obviously of her own unique\u2026 flavor. Tonight, Naoki intends to learn just what flavor that is, and acquaint himself with this newest follower of hers. This evening will set many precedents, and will also be an excellent opportunity for Venus to ask questions of her own. To this end, Naoki starts with a leading question. \u201cSo\u2014if I might, Venus. What brings you here, in a general sense? To Isra. You\u2019re hardly the first to approach me seeking a job, but you seem to stand to gain little compared to most others.\u201d ", "1516358219000": "Naoki evidently finds what Venus says amusing, and exhales sharply, rolling her eyes.\u201cI get that a lot.\u201dShe isn\u2019t sure what all these otherworldly entities find so damn interesting about her, but Naoki certainly doesn\u2019t mind the sort of attention they seem to bring. \u201cWhat is it, then,\u201d she presses, \u201cthat Isra has to offer you? What are your goals here? Surely, you haven\u2019t come all this way just to make passes at me.\u201d", "1516360688000": "Venus earns herself an exasperated sigh and an exaggerated rolling of Naoki\u2019s eyes.

I aim to understand your motivations to know if I can trust you.\u201d\u201cIt certainly is tempting to take you here and now but, as you said, I have control. I also have a responsibility not to endanger my life foolishly. Who\u2019s to say that you won\u2019t snap my neck, steal my soul, or otherwise act against me at the first opportunity? There\u2019s a huge multitude of ways you could stand to profit off double-crossing me. And at present, I don\u2019t see any reason to suspect you won\u2019t. ...

She feels as if they\u2019ve just saved themselves a lot of trouble, but doesn\u2019t say as much.This is beginning to make a lot of sense. Naoki admits, she\u2019s probably the best friend to have if one\u2019s aim is to obtain some artifact in the Overworld. This context for Venus\u2019 actions removes some suspicion, and Naoki is glad to now know. \u201cYou have reason to suspect, then, that the artifacts you\u2019re referring to are here, then, in some sense of the word?\u201d Naoki taps one finger on the table, clinking her nail against the stone beneath the tablecloth.", "1516431693000": "Naoki nods.

Leaning back in her chair, Naoki strikes a contemplative look, communicating that she\u2019s thinking.To assist Venus would be to align Isra with the Eleven Hells, and side against the rebels. In her consideration, Naoki doesn\u2019t necessarily have any issue with that idea. It wouldn\u2019t be doing anything \u201cworse\u201d than she\u2019s already done, it would be just\u00a0another foray into demon politics. Surely it will go as well as the first.\u201cWhat sort of scale do you think we\u2019ll be operating on\u2014how difficult is it for him to send his agents between realms, and how powerful are they, do you think? What form will the enemy take?\u201d", "1516446094000": "Listening, Naoki nods quietly, digesting the information. It sounds as if it will be a high-level battle, in which only the strongest individuals can compete. Rather than preparing the army to mobilize, she\u2019ll give notice to the Sun Marshals. Them, and the dragonslayer community. Many of the same tactics effective against dragons ought to be effective against similarly sized birds, she figures.At Venus\u2019 mention of a guest, Naoki\u2019s eyebrows furrow, and she aims a scolding look downward.\u201cWell, he\u2019d best cut it out.

It\u2019s an apt name. For Venus, a bottle of Silverleaf wine, as requested, complete with glass, cooler, and corkscrew. In addition, he places a small basket of cheese bread in the center of the table, assuring them that their food will be ready shortly.

Something you might not have known about me is that there aren\u2019t any ears on the side of my head.\u201dTo illustrate, Naoki moves her hair aside to show Venus that, yes, there are exactly zero ears on the side of her head.

Looking down from the balcony, Naoki idly watches the other diners go about their business. The atmosphere is a bit subdued, but she hardly minds. Venus ranks highly on Naoki\u2019s \u201cinteresting individuals with which I have dined\u201d list, and if they ever do this again, Naoki resolves to come prepared with some talking points. For now,  however, she figures it about time to cut to the chase. \u201cTell me,\u201d Naoki begins, looking across the table. \u201cVenus, do you have any intention whatsoever, at any time\u2014now, or in the future, to harm me in any sense of the word?\u201d", "1518497125000": "Naoki\u2019s eyebrows flatten, and her mouth moves from one side of her face to the other.

After exchanging greetings, Naoki wishes the waitress a good day and proceeds off to the right, to another door.From there, down one flight of stairs into a somewhat lengthy, gradually curving hallway, which she follows all the way to the end. Throughout the trip, one might notice an incredible variety in the magic present around them. Some are easy to identify, protection runes on the wall, everburning candles, and similar. Others are not as apparent in function. One may get the impression that The Eclipse is a bit larger than it might seem, and considerably more happens within than just fine dining. Soon enough, however, they arrive at their destination. A large, squarish room of a very peculiar description indeed.Someone innocent may take it for a sort of bedroom, on account of the large bed in the center of the room. Seemingly the only bed, though, around it, many other bits of furniture are spread. There are tables, chairs, couches, loveseats, cabinets, dressers, sets of drawers, and some more... unusual pieces of furniture. One seems to be a bench that curves up and down along its length. It doesn\u2019t look like a very good bench; one would slide down. There are a few\u2026 wedge shapes standing upright as if very thin sitting stools, as well as several other similarly strange items, the purpose of which may be unclear to the uninformed.A large portion of the furniture is storage furniture. Not shelves, mind you, only things that open and close. One might infer that that is where all of the room\u2019s objects are hidden, because there seems not a single non-furniture, non-pillow item visible in the room.Further inspection would find that even the furniture\u2019s placement is\u2026 illogical. Which is not to say the room is cluttered, but there are tables without chairs, chairs that face the wall, and countertops standing freely. Nothing seems to be oriented in relation to anything else in a way that makes sense. However, almost everything in the room has three common attributes. Upholstery is very prevalent. (There is even an upholstered table.) All protruding corners are rounded, and everything is bolted to the ground. In addition, there seem to be a great many hooks, o-rings, built into the ceiling, for whatever reason. The lot of it is lit by an unseen light source with a cozy orangish-glow. Presumably magic. Stepping down into the room, Naoki briefly scans it and nods. Everything seems to be as she left it, which is good.", "1518680233000": "Indeed, one would there are two chaises present. One traditional, one extra-wide. Reaching a conclusion, Naoki moves off to the left, where there is a sizeable set of drawers. She bends with her back to Venus to chest the lowest drawer first.

It isn\u2019t until she reaches the fifth from the bottom that she finds what she was looking for. \u201cAhah.\u201d Pulling it free, Naoki shuts the drawer and returns to Venus, displaying the item. \u201cIt\u2019s a choker,\u201d she says.

So consumed by lust, she lost track of time, (and there are hardly any windows to speak of).It must have been quite a while, she thinks\u2014at least several hours, as she\u2019s utterly exhausted, in the very best way. Lying sideways on the bed, Naoki heaves a great sigh of contentment. Though a bit sore, and terribly terribly sticky, she is, ultimately, satiated.Looking to the side, she finds Lady Venus  , who Naoki thinks ought to be sticky, at the very least. She aims an inquisitive look in Venus\u2019s general direction, curious how her new friend is faring.", "1523118537000": "\u201cIt was,\u201d Naoki agrees, sporting one of her smuggest smirks.

Would you like me to have the staff get something for you to eat?\"Naoki shakes her head. \"That was a lead-in to, 'Thank-you-for-the-wonderful-evening, but, it's-late, and, I-really-ought-to-be-getting-home.'\"\"You can leave the choker anywhere around here,\" she continues, moving to collect her dress.\"The first door on the left leads to a staircase which will deposit you into one of the baths upstairs.

I\u2019m pleased you could make it.\u201d She gestures, \u201cHave a seat and peruse the menu.\u201dReseating herself, Naoki addresses the waitress, \u201cI\u2019ll have the Eucharist Premi\u00e8re with a tall Blizzard, please.\u201dThe waitress nods and makes a note on her pad.", "1544329001000": "Nov 9, 2018 18:35:34 GMT -8 Keph said:Keph jumped in place, his hand placing itself on his chest. Hel, what was it with people always sneaking up on him?! He turned around, nodding at the waitress - he was in fact 'Keph'.\u00a0He followed her after being beckoned, looking around in a mix of awe and distaste for the ridiculous splendour the establishment offered, he could only wonder as to who all those people seated at its tables were and how in the name of Yatan they could afford to eat here, granted he had no clue what the exact price tag on their meals was, but he had a good feeling that they cost a small fortune.A hesitant wave was given to the threatening Imperial Sentinels before walking up the stairs, still following the waitress, finally, it appeared they had reached his table. Usually, he could just grab a table and get some grub, but it appeared the nobility really liked overcomplicating things.\u00a0Seeing the Empress sat on the opposite side of the table caused him to, just like when arrived, feel as if the season had suddenly shifted to Summer. He shakingly pulled the only available chair, and sat with his date, loudly swallowing and putting zero effort into concealing his nervousness. He gave her a quick wave, before hiding himself in the menu. Unable to really tell what half of the stuff in it was, because of their odd name choices, he decided he might as well just ask for something vague and let the waitress select what might sound best for him.\u00a0\"Keph needs a mug of mead and whatever their best seafood dish is.\" The young man placed the menu in a standing position in front of him, allowing him to hide from the Empress' glare as he wrote the message for the waitress, but the protection it gave him wouldn't last very long since soon the waitress would, of course, be taking their menus with her, forcing him to actually have to make eye contact.\u00a0As Keph arrives and seats himself, The Empress smiles. She\u2019s been looking forward to this. She finds his little wave particularly amusing and exhales sharply.After acknowledging his note, it is with some degree of sympathy that the waitress takes Keph\u2019s menu and retreats down the stairs. She has no idea what the circumstances of the meeting are, but as enviable as his position is, it\u2019s not difficult to tell the young man doesn\u2019t find it comfortable. Then Keph is left alone with The Empress. She smiles again, aiming for more \u2018freindly\u2019 than \u2018predatory,\u2019 and breaks the silence before it has a chance to settle in. \u201cSo,\u201d she begins, \u201cWhat are Keph\u2019s initial impressions of The Eclipse? It\u2019s a unique establishment.\u201d", "1545035274000": "The Empress averts her gaze as Keph is writing, instead looking out over the balcony. Below, patrons and waitstaff go about their business, coming and going, speaking quietly amongst themselves. Naoki spends some time idly considering what she will wear for the upcoming Yuletide Festival, but Keph is finished soon enough. It only takes a moment for her to read his note.\u201cOoh, thank you.\u201d The Empress accepts the compliment gracefully, touching her chest. She doesn\u2019t quite blush, but definitely looks at Keph in an exceedingly deliberate manner \u2014 whatever that means.But from there she\u2019s quick to move to address what she construes as questions. \u201cAs far as The Eclipse is concerned... It may seem pretentious and needlessly luxurious because it is, and that\u2019s part of the point. It\u2019s a different type of dining experience for a different type of person. Imagine the last inn where Keph ate a meal outside the city walls. Imagine what would happen if I were to enter it. And then further imagine what it would be like to have our date there.\"She pauses to allow Keph to consider that but continues after a moment. \u201cThe short answer is 'problems'. Unwanted attention, among others. It would certainly detract from our date, and neither one of us would be as comfortable as we are here.\u201d The Empress bounces slightly in her upholstered seat, in her case referring to physical comfort.\u201cIn contrast, here, we are alone. This is private. Safe and secluded, way up here out of the public eye. There\u2019s no worry of pickpockets or eavesdroppers, and nothing to interrupt us.\u201d Naoki gestures to the area around them. Despite all other possible concerns, it is not actively interfering.\u201cOthers come here for similar reasons. We could go on to discuss the role of luxury establishments in the social and economic realms of Isra, but Keph doesn\u2019t talk, and the food is here.\u201dAnd indeed it is. ", "1549339961000": "Jan 2, 2019 18:44:07 GMT -8 Keph said:Keph shrunk in his seat as the Empress showed him a bit of appreciation for his compliment, immediately after he looked down at the floor; no doubt she's heard constant compliments from everyone else and no doubt they must get exhausting. He sighed once again and began to nervously glance over at the door, wondering when the food was going to finally arrive.Suddenly, as Naoki replied to his previous points on the establishment, he sat up straight, his eyes rising up to hers. He nodded again-and-again, yet as her reasoning came to a close he appeared to be unsatisfied with it, just as he grabbed his quill and notebook once more, Empress appeared to indirectly try to shift the focus to the food which had just arrived; he pouted at the food, just a moment ago he had wanted exactly this, but now he had a need to voice his constant displeasure with noble life.He picked up a shrimp off of his plate and perked a brow as he noticed the fact it was uncooked, he shrugged and threw it into his mouth -- it was good, but it wasn't the best he had ever had. Right after he had picked at his dish a bit more (and never bothering to use proper eating utensils), he took a good sip from the tankard and wiped the alcohol on the sleeve of the fancy uniform the monarch's money had recently bought him.After letting the alcohol sit for a bit, he definitely felt a bit better about everything. He briefly stared at the oddly coloured drink Naoki had chosen for herself, even going so far as to flick the side of the glass, wondering if maybe, as he had seen in the Citadel, it might be some magically improved beverage with some amusing properties.As he sat there, still pecking at his dish, Keph had slid his notebook onto the table, next to his plate, and began writing with his left hand, impressively he didn't even need to look at the notebook and yet the writing was on point:\u00a0 \"Keph understands the need for privacy, but that doesn't explain the need for excess. What does miss Naoki do for fun? The little time he has known her she always appears overly restrained.\" With the alcohol renewing his spirit, he appeared to re-focus on the establishment's ridiculous luxuries, yet slyly (or at least he thought so) slid into another conversation entirely in the same message.Reading Keph\u2019s message, Naoki shrugs lightly. \u201cIt also has to do with societal expectations, showboating, and the idea that people aim to have the best for themselves.\u201d\u201cConsider down there, Robert Fletcher, an excellent example. At the bar with the white hair.\u201d The Empress gestures through the railing of the balcony with her fork.\u201cRobert is my Minister of Primary Industry. Much of the work he does is related to importing and exporting goods through Port Silverion \u2014 where his office is. It\u2019s a very high position; he reports directly to me, has many responsibilities, and is paid very well. Robert is easily one of the most powerful and wealthy men in Isra.\u201dAs she pauses to chew her food, The Empress observes Robert and his friend for a few moments, angling her ears in an effort to catch a snippet of their conversation.\u201cYou may be able to tell,\u201d Naoki continues, \u201cHe\u2019s wearing a very expensive outfit. Here, at The Moonlight Eclipse, speaking with that expensive-looking woman, who he probably ordered an expensive drink. This is something he does often. Robert likes to flaunt his wealth; he takes pride in it and enjoys the sort of attention it earns him.\u201dA significant look is meant to imply that beautiful women only talk to Robert for one of two reasons and that woman probably isn\u2019t speaking with him about economic strategy. \u201cThat\u2019s why Robert engages in excess. Many others do so for similar reasons, most of which boil down to \u2018to impress others.\u2019 They do all sorts of little things to make sure others know just how wealthy they are. Fancy hats, elaborate speaking, landscaping their mansions\u2026\u201d Naoki waves a dismissive hand, the list goes on.\u201cBecause in certain cultural groups that exist in Isra, wealth is considered to be equivalent to the quality of an individual, and how much respect they are owed.\u201dHaving done her best to speak in what she thinks to be an objective manner, Naoki hopes that she\u2019s given Keph a fair explanation of the \u201cupper crust,\u201d as it were. It didn\u2019t seem like he was much in favor of such things to begin with, but now he hopefully has an improved understanding.\u201cI\u2019m not going to try to say that I'm much better, but I don\u2019t engage in excess for its own sake \u2014 if you\u2019d like to see that, you should visit Gauldin, and have a look at their nobility, they use gilded teacups. And I certainly don\u2019t need to assert anything.\u201d With that said and a light chuckle, she feels content to leave the matter there, rather than speak at length about herself.Naoki pauses to wipe her face before digging into Keph\u2019s next question. She considers it for a long moment before beginning. \u201cI could give you the courtly answer: that I practice archery. Or I could say that I read recreationally. Both of those things are true. But in an effort to be less \u2018restrained,\u2019 I\u2019ll just tell you that my favorite recreational activity is lovemaking.\u201dNaoki isn\u2019t sure if Keph was fishing for that answer or if she used his wording against him, but she doesn\u2019t mind either way.\u201cI have found that is there is nothing else that brings as much joy not only to me but to my partner. Seeing another person in the throes of ecstasy as a direct result of my actions\u2026\u201d She trails off, making a ring of her forefinger and thumb.\u201cThat\u2019s what life is about for me,\u201d she admits, \u201cEven in a grander sense than that. I serve Isra because I know it to be the greater good. The work that I do ultimately results in an environment where the people of Isra may lead happy and relatively easy lives, without fear of invasion, crime, starvation, and so on. I find it pleasing to use what power I have to help the people as a whole as well as individuals. It\u2019s impossible to help everyone, but I like to think I\u2019ve done much.\u201dNaoki offers yet another small shrug. \u201cThat\u2019s how I tick. \u2026 How\u2019s that for less restrained?\u201d", "1550460258000": "Reading Keph\u2019s first note, Naoki nods. At the end of the day, it\u2019s the reality they live in. She enjoys monologuing and could go on to speak of the nuances of Isran society, but that\u2019s not how she planned to spend the evening. Another time, perhaps. Amused by his reaction and pleased that the timing worked out so well, Naoki smirks. His second note, however, is enough to prompt a bout of unfeigned laughter.\u201cYes, Keph. That\u2019s the only reason anyone ever goes on a date.\u201dWiping at her eye, she smiles. This is going very well; Keph is proving to be more entertaining than any jester, and all of their clothing is still on.\u201cThere\u2019s a process to it, though,\u201d Naoki continues, recomposed, \u201cKeph will notice that rather than suggesting Keph drop Keph\u2019s pants there in The Citadel yesterday, I\u2019ve gone ahead and set up this nice candle-lit atmosphere.\u201d She gestures around them and then to the food. \u201cHere is the dine, and wine was implicitly offered. Keph and I spent some amount of time discussing an unrelated topic before easing into this conversation \u2014 though perhaps somewhat suddenly. Once finished here, I will suggest that Keph and I retire to a private room in the back.\u201d Still grinning, she moves then to continue eating, evidently not yet finished.", "1551303684000": "The grin remains affixed to Naoki\u2019s face as she watches Keph begin to scarf down his food. \u201cI thought he might,\u201d she responds, popping another bit of pastry into her mouth.Then, a thought strikes her. She abruptly raises one finger but finishes chewing before she speaks.\u201cFirst, I have this question\u2026 Forgive me if this is too personal\u2026\u201d With her other hand, she wipes her mouth as she considers how to phrase it.\u201cWhat\u2019s the deal with Keph\u2019s preferred mode of address?\u201d\u201cIs it that Keph would see themselves referred to in the third person? Is it that Keph doesn\u2019t wish to be included in pronouns, or specifically dislikes personal pronouns like \u2018you\u2019? What about pronouns like \u2018our,\u2019 or \u2018us\u2019? What rules are at play there, as far as my wording should be concerned? This has been bugging me the whole meal, and I should like to know what\u2019s what, and, if I might, why.\u201d She punctuates this final word by pressing her finger into the tabletop, insistent. Though not explicitly \"demanding\" answers, it\u2019s clear that she would quite like to know.", "1552181569000": "As she reads Keph\u2019s note, Naoki deflates. \u201cOh.\u201d \u201cAnd here I am, making all manner of assumptions and overthinking to the Nth degree!\u201d She exhales sharply, amused with herself. \u201cFair enough, then, fair enough,\u201d waving her hands, Naoki dismisses the matter. \u201cYes \u2014 that will be a story for another time.\u201d \u201cFor now\u2026\u201d She rises, placing her napkin to cover the last few bits of food on her place. \u201cIt seems that I, am finished.\u201dFor a moment, Naoki says nothing, hands on the back of her chair. She pushes it in very deliberately before speaking as if reading from a script, \u201cThere is a cozy room in the back. I suggest that we retire there.\u201d", "1553917861000": "Seeing Keph pale, Naoki frowns inwardly. She had intended that to be amusing, but it seems like she didn\u2019t quite hit the mark.Regardless, she heads for the stairs. On the way down, it occurs to her that the usual spots would probably scare him, what with their equipment and such. She decides instead it would be preferable, or at least less fuss, to take Keph to one of The Eclipse\u2019s suites.Pushing the door wide, Naoki strides into the room. In line with its role as essentially an upscale tavern, The Moonlight Eclipse boasts a compliment of upscale inn rooms. Some of them, like this one, are large and lavishly decorated, with rugs, paintings, chandeliers, throw pillows, and so on \u2014 all of it with gold trim. One could even say it is \"fit for a king,\" and, as matter of fact, King Renaux of Trav\u00e9re stayed in this very room a few years ago while attending the summit of the time. Considering the earlier conversation about excess, this is in no manner appropriate. Placing her hands on her hips, Naoki huffs and shakes her head lightly. \u201cThis is... acceptable,\u201d she supposes, \u201cunless you would prefer we find another room.\u201d Despite saying this, Naoki doesn\u2019t look back to see if Keph would or not. She instead declares, \u201cI\u2019m going to start a fire,\u201d and starts toward the fireplace, fumbling with the pouch on her hip. ", "1556917873000": "Before long, a small fire is crackling merrily away in the fireplace. After a moment\u2019s thought, Naoki decides to extinguish the rest of the lights in the room, leaving only the flickering fire for light. Satisfied with this, she nods to herself, cracks her knuckles, and begins. Standing with the fire at her back, Naoki turns toward Keph. After establishing eye contact, only once she\u2019s sure he\u2019s looking, does Naoki takes off her dress. It, being a one-piece sweaterdress, does not drop to the ground dramatically, pooling around her feet in a silken puddle of sin. Instead, the knitted garment comes up and off over her head, after an amount of tugging and shimmying. It's not quite as elegant as it could possibly be, but the dress comes off. Backlit by the fire, with little more than her stocking and garter belt, Naoki takes one step toward Keph. Then another. Once within reach, she raises one hand to show it to him, as if to say, \u201cLook, it\u2019s just my hand.\u201dIn what is intended as a most nonthreatening manner, she places it on his shoulder. She holds it there for a moment, waiting to see if he will spontaneously combust. When it seems like he won\u2019t be, Naoki slides her hand to Keph\u2019s chest, to see if she can feel the beat of his heart through the fabric of his doublet. Pressing with the tips of her fingers, Naoki pushes Keph back, back, backbackback\u2026 Until he\u2019s lying more or less flat on the bed. Removing all but one finger, she silently bids him remain as such as she trails a line down, down his stomach to the buckle of Keph's pants. Grasping it firmly with both hands, she\u2019s about to set about undoing it when a thought strikes her.Leaning back slightly, Naoki clears her throat. \u201cEhm. This would be your opportunity to leave, should you be so inclined. ... Otherwise, I\u2019ll continue\u2026?\u201d She quirks an eyebrow, looking for confirmation. ", "1560044519000": "\u201cOh!~\u201d momentarily stunned by the surprise kiss, Naoki blinks several times before recovering and fixing Keph with a look that is simultaneously incredulous and amused. In any other situation, she would not permit such a brazenly cheeky move, but in this case, she allows it.\u201cVery well!\u201d she responds, giving Keph a playful shove back down onto the bed and moving to finish her work on his belt buckle. Hooking her fingers into the sides of Keph\u2019s pants, Naoki smirks, and feels it appropriate to add, \u201cRemember that I offered.\u201dAs human (ish) as though she may be, the circumstances of the meeting have not changed, and neither has the associated power dynamic. Through her actions, Naoki makes it clear that the night will progress as she sees fit, but not in such a way that robs Keph of all agency.After the first freebie, Naoki introduces the premise that they will be going \u201cone for one,\u201d meaning that anything Keph wishes to receive he must first give to her. Typically, such a policy would be unenforceable, but it just so happens that she has a handy-dandy little ring that will do precisely that, and it just so happens that she slid it on him a few moments ago. This necessarily leads to some amount of frustration for Keph, as he must expend considerably more effort than he would otherwise to achieve the same end. Alternately, he is subjected to what may be best described as an onslaught until the seemingly arbitrary point Naoki is satisfied. As inequitable as though this may seem, 1:1 is as fair as it gets, and, as she points out, otherwise he would be out within an hour.But for as frustrating as it may be, Naoki thinks it a very effective way to teach. As the night stretches on, she coaches Keph and critiques his technique, telling him how to adjust his angle, when to change his pace, and so on \u2014 and why. She does this primarily for her own benefit but does so regardless, bestowing upon Keph a portion of her vast wisdom. And through the skillful application of these learnings, Keph would find that Naoki is not impossible to please. She always maintains a great deal of control but can be quite receptive when she\u2019d like to be. And sometimes she is, intending to preserve at least a portion of Keph\u2019s ego. For her part, Naoki seems to enjoy herself. She\u2019s always relished the reactions of her partners. Their faces, the funny little sounds they make, and so on. She particularly enjoys the sound of the naive as they experience sensations for the first, second, third, fourth, fifth time\u2026 And the fact that Keph doesn\u2019t speak makes it that much better because if she does it juust right, she can tease noises out of him where there were none before! As a challenge for herself, Naoki directs the evening in such a way that is intended to coax as much out of Keph as she possibly can.They continue long into the night, with occasional breaks for Keph to catch his breath and for Naoki to fuel the fire. But it doesn\u2019t seem as though she\u2019s getting tired. She goes and goes and goes, spurring Keph on with encouraging words, the appeal of her body, and fun little tricks she can do with her fingers. Where Naoki gets all this energy is anyone\u2019s guess, but the correct answer would be the tattoo on her inner thigh. It channels just the smallest trickle of lust magic to keep Naoki as energized and enthusiastic as the moment they started. One perk of making deals with demons.And they continue long into the night! Naoki is determined to get her evening's worth out of poor Keph, even if it means he\u2019ll be sore for weeks to come, and even if she has to do the last of it herself. With the fire at her back and the shadow of her tail twisting and dancing on the far wall, Naoki continues until the point where it seems Keph has been thoroughly exhausted and has nothing more to give.The only sounds in the room are heavy breathing and the crackling fire. Naoki remains exactly where she is. The shadow of her tail has slowed to a gentle wave, and over the course of a few moments, her breathing returns to normal.From her vantage, Naoki looks down at Keph. His hair\u2019s a mess. He\u2019s tired, sweaty, almost as filthy as she is, and above all, spent. \u2026 But he\u2019s still rather cute, in that roguish, amusing, yet simultaneously youthful and innocent way that he is. He has a certain charm about him \u2014 even from this angle.Terribly pleased with herself, Naoki smirks one of her high-order smirks. With one hand on Keph's chest she rolls her hips one last time,\u00a0and then she's done.At some point, Keph would wake to find himself alone in the lavish room. Under a clean blanket, but alone. Naoki and her belongings are nowhere to be seen. The notebook he brought with him lies open on the nightstand. A page has been removed, and a note written on it.Keph,You weren\u2019t able to fully appreciate food served at The Moonlight Eclipse, but I hope you enjoyed our date nonetheless - I did. I enjoyed the evening we spent together and would enjoy doing it again.I know not where the roads of chance, fate, or adventure may take one such as yourself, but know there will always be accommodations for you at The Citadel. The facilities spend most of their time unused, so I insist upon making them available to you - at whatever time, for any duration - live there if you want. The Citadel Gates are always open for you.Further, I invite you to purchase new equipment. I didn\u2019t say anything at the time, but it seemed as though your clothing had been worn well. Given the option, there are surely some things that you would like to upgrade or purchase, and so I am offering to cover said expenses \u2014 on the condition that you return sometime soon such that we might have more \u201cdates\u201d in the future.Wishing you well in your travels,-Naoki", "1560044618000": "On the reverse of the page, to be noticed later, there are additional notes that go into detail.Regarding The Citadel, he should approach and profess himself to be \u201cKeph.\u201d The gate guards and chamberlain have received instructions to receive him.Her offer extends only to items that would be of use to Keph himself. Clothing, weapons, tools, bags, mounts, books, supplies for writing, and so on. She trusts him to be responsible about it but also explicitly specifies that her intention is to be exceedingly generous in her offer. Keph should avoid artifact dealers and items of obnoxious price, but otherwise treat himself - should he choose to accept her offer.In the context of her offer she further specifies that it isn\u2019t of great concern when he returns. Next week is too soon but the week after is probably fine, as is the next month, few months, or even the next year or so. She doesn\u2019t expect him to commit to any sort of schedule and doesn\u2019t mean to imply a formal obligation of any sort. Rather, she\u2019s only looking for the truthful intention to \u201ccome back again soon,\u201d whenever that may be.Her offer stands indefinitely; Keph can visit the Offices of The Treasury Department at any point to receive a writ he can show to merchants. Naoki goes on to warn Keph that despite The Guard\u2019s best efforts there are still pickpockets in Isra, and the writ is of theoretically infinite worth. He should be discrete, cautious of thieves, and  if Keph intends to use the writ in the market, she suggests requesting an escort. He should not retain the writ for any extended period. After he\u2019s used it, either return or burn it and obtain another at a later date, should he wish to. From the way it\u2019s written, one might guess that a similar writ has been stolen before.", "1586127488000": "A few moments pass before a host exits the building and approaches Ulfang. \u201cLord,\u201d he begins, giving a half-bow of courtesy, \u201cShe is inside.\u201d The Empress has evidently arrived by alternate means. The host offers no explanation, and indeed, doesn\u2019t even use either of their names. Whether this is standard business practice or if the crisply-dressed man is acting on special orders is unclear. Regardless, the host shows Ulfang the appropriate amount of respect (all of it), as he leads the way through The Moonlight Eclipse. The atmosphere is rather lively, considering the time. Each and every one of the booths are filled, as many meetings are held at The Moonlight eclipse \u2014 meetings of and by all sorts. However, much of the conversation is subdued by runes, so it\u2019s decidedly quieter than one might expect given how many diners are present. The sheer size of Ulfang catches the eye of more than a few patrons, sending a great many of them wondering who he might be. A few of the most well-informed recognize him, given the presence of Dreadknights outside the city walls and his visit to The Citadel yesterday, but they are few indeed, only those whose job it is to know such things. By and large, The King of The Black Vale remains all but unknown to the Isran people \u2014 as of yet. The host leads him toward the rear of the building, through a door labeled \u201cStaff Only\u201d. From there, it\u2019s only a short corridor to a passage guarded by two Imperial Sentinels. This is where the host stops, gesturing for Ulfang to continue past them himself.There is then a short staircase leading up to his ultimate destination. It\u2019s an alcove of sorts, with a balcony that looks out over the very same dining area he passed through on the way in. From below, the balcony was seemingly shrouded in darkness, but from within it\u2019s plain to see the table, the two chairs, and The Empress sitting in one of them. \u201cAh, Ulfang.\u201d Naoki nods in greeting as she sees him ascending the stairs. Evidently, she has seen fit to dress up the slightest bit for tonight and has swapped her usual red sweaterdress for an otherwise identical black one, which then contrasts sharply with the white tablecloth. She makes a perfunctory gesture for him to sit.On the table, there are bundles of silverware and a small basket of rolls, one of which Naoki has started on and now sits half-eaten before her. She seems to be in high enough spirits, but remains reserved and as aloof as is appropriate.", "1586488123000": "Naoki nods several times in response to Ulfang. Yes, it is a lovely night. Yes, if only the stars would come out. And yes, she is looking absolutely ravishing tonight, and it\u2019s astute of him to notice.\u201cSometime,\u201d she supposes, \u201cI\u2019ll take you to my observatory \u2014 it\u2019s one of my pet projects, astronomy. To see the stars from down here, very pretty, yes, majestic. Innumerable lights cast against the darkness of the infinite deep. But to behold one from up close\u2026\u201d Standing up, Naoki leans in for effect. Her voice drops, \u201c...is another sort of beauty entirely.\u201d Naoki's gesturing finger reaches out, crosses the table, closes in on, and then lightly boops Ulfang\u2019s nose.\u201cYou\u2019ll have to excuse my eccentricity,\u201d she explains, sitting. \u201cBut it\u2019s a terrible sort of raw, humbling beauty I\u2019ve not beheld anything like anywhere else. Great plumes of starfire with more energy than all the magic in The Overworld combined, an infinite expanse of light brighter than anything\u2026\u201d Trailing off, she gestures for effect. \u201cThere is no subtext,\u201d she cheerfully remarks. \u201cJust incredible enough to inspire a small tirade, just as such.\u201d\u201cHungry?\u201d Naoki gestures for their waiter to approach.", "1588181601000": "\u201cNot nearly as firey as the stars,\u201d Naoki quips, her ears then snapping toward the stairs.A moment later, a member of the waitstaff arrives on the balcony, pen & quill in one hand and a menu in the other. He bows \u2014 the very image of decorum, and offers the menu to Ulfang without a word.\u201cThe omelette, please.\u201d The Empress knows what she wants and the kitchen knows how she wants it. The waiter nods and makes a note on their pad.That done, Naoki leans back to choose her words and allow Ulfang some time with the menu. It\u2019s a rather large placard that details a great bevy of dishes, ranging from the staple of \u201cMeat & Potatoes\u201d all the way up to dishes of seafood listed in Katashiman script. The wine and dessert menus are absent, but a note at the bottom states that the kitchen will attempt to fulfill any request as best they are able (given time), where the word \u2018any\u2019 is italicized in an ever-so-slightly dubious manner.Naoki moves as if to respond to Ulfang, but catches herself and instead makes a benign comment about the soups.It may be underestimating the loyalty of The Eclipse\u2019s top waiter. It may not be necessary or in any way effective, all this secrecy, but this is untrodden ground. Ulfang stands to become something neither Naoki nor The Empress has ever had before, and past a certain point, she knows not how to handle the situation or even what she intends to do. Not that their current conversation is particularly telling, but so far her behavior with Ulfang outwardly appears utterly unsurprising to everyone. Should this waiter chap get impressions and share them, words will get twisted and speculation will begin. And the people don\u2019t get to speculate until she knows herself. Overthinking? Absolutely, but excessive caution in unfamiliar situations has gotten her as far as this.", "1589061573000": "This, the waiter makes careful note of, inscribing Ulfang\u2019s order word for word. Hearing the special request, the waiter\u2019s eyes dart to the side, he hesitates. \u201cI\u2026 believe I may have served that dish once before,\u201d he says, tickling his chin with the quill. \u2026 He doesn\u2019t quite remember. \u201cRegardless, I will inform the kitchen, they will consult their records, and we will do our very best,\u201d he assures Ulfang with a bow. After offering The Empress a similar bow he excuses himself.Naoki is struck by the question and inclines her head in consideration.After a pause, the best she has is, \u201cSignificantly?\u201d Naoki shrugs. \u201cI\u2019m unsure how to quantify it, but I don\u2019t believe the average man lends as much credence to their hearing as I do. They\u2019re as second eyes; I can navigate by them,  distinguish footsteps, judge distance, hear breathing, and so on. To wear a hat is to wear a blindfold and loud noises are as bright lights. They provide superb situation awareness \u2014 of that there\u2019s no doubt, but they can be a burden sometimes, when it rains, for example. I must carry an umbrella for lack of hat, I can't hear over the sound, and thunder is that much more vivid, so sometimes I startle.\"\u201cBut!\u201d she says, brandishing a finger, \u201cI will also have you know that they are incredibly soft. How soft \u2014 you may one day find out, but-.She pivots. \u201cHere\u2019s something I rarely have the opportunity to ask about \u2014 with the understanding that I will take no offense if none is intended: what thoughts do you hold regarding demihumans?\u201dA question born of curiosity, but more so of a desire to see how Ulfang handles the touchy topic when presented with it as such.\u201cThere\u2019s a greater variety, and likely many more here in Isra than there are in your land, and the same can be said for every foreigner I\u2019ve ever met. My view is far from objective, yet it\u2019s hardly an appropriate topic to ask about. And even if I did, I would only ever hear the same answer \u2014 for obvious reasons.\u201d Relating back to her ears. \u201cWhat thoughts do you have?\u201d", "1591986908000": "Naoki nods along as Ulfang details his thoughts and the isolationist bent of his Valemen. A fine enough topic to touch on, but she welcomes the change of subject. She exhales sharply in response and chuckles. \u201cWere only centaurs not so rare,\u201d she laments \u2014 which is phrased as a jest but really isn\u2019t. \u201cI\u2019m told that only a few have ever visited Isra, and I\u2019ve not met a single one \u2014 here or elsewhere \u2014 if you\u2019d believe that.\u201d She shakes her head. \u201cBut your performance was admirable,\u201d she concedes, \u201cProbably comparable. It seems you\u2019re not nearly as decrepit as one would assume for an elder of your age.\u201d Though said with a straight face, afterward it\u2019s Naoki\u2019s turn to grin.\u201cTime will tell if it takes,\" she supposes, \"But I suspect we\u2019ll be visiting the Den again soon regardless.\u201d She reaches for another piece of bread. \u201cIt usually takes a day or so for them to clean. \u2026 You mentioned that you\u2019ve left your kingdom in good hands, yes?\u201d", "1593216910000": "Naoki exhales sharply, amused. She doesn\u2019t doubt that a well-organized undead army is capable of a great deal and knows consolidation of power quite well.\u201cI haven\u2019t seriously considered traveling in some time. \u2026 Were I to do any traveling, I would leave Liz \u2014 my Consul, Elizabeth Finch  , in charge of The Empire,\u201d she supposes. \u201cBack in the old days, when the city was young and before I achieved office, I sponsored a promising-looking soldier's entry into Ildesias\u2019s Dawn Riders. Griffins are not inexpensive, but as someone privy to The Citadel\u2019s secrets and a scout besides, the information she was able to provide me with was of incredible value.\u201d\u201cWhen I was elected, I gave her command of The Dawn Riders. Since then, she\u2019s led our forces to victory in essentially all of Isra\u2019s important battles. I\u2019m no longer quite as inept as I once was in the art of war, but I relied on her heavily during the early years of my rule. She was there for the invasion of Goraia, she led Isra\u2019s response to Aaedan, and she has defended the city from many attacks \u2014 monsters from the forest and the like. She grew alongside me into a decorated combat veteran and a respected leader of men. For a better friend and ally, I could not ask.\u201d \u201cI was, of course, sorry to see my best commander retire. But more than that, I was relieved. ... I worried for her,\u201d Naoki admits, looking away. \u201cEvery time she flew into battle \u2014 I didn\u2019t doubt her, per se, but Isra has faced some truly dangerous foes and any fight very well could have been her last. I\u2019ve even had a few nightmares to that extent, having to hold a funeral and so on. \u2026 That\u2019s the price I pay for mixing the personal and professional, but perhaps this has become oversharing.\u201d\u201cRegardless, I trust Liz to speak in my name and I am grateful that she\u2019s come out of retirement to assist me as Consul. She\u2019s far more mobile than I am, with infinitely more combat experience. She sees to much of that which needs doing in relation to the state of The Empire\u2019s military power and defensive structures \u2014 I haven\u2019t personally inspected the border in ages. We are all safer for it, and I am glad for the lightened workload.\u201dTearing the last piece of bread in two, Naoki leaves half for Ulfang and raises hers in mock-toast, presumably to Liz.\u201cI don\u2019t doubt her ability to hold things together in my absence, but I wouldn\u2019t wish it upon her,\u201d Naoki continues, returning to the notion of travel. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be gone more than a handful of weeks at the most, and I would need to prepare months in advance. I would have to fly both ways just to make it there and back, and it\u2019s probably a poor idea to travel with child.\u201d Naoki hums as she chews, then shrugs. \u201cWe\u2019ll see, I suppose. I want for the degree of independence you have.\u201d One ear twitches. \u201cHere comes our food.\u201dAnd sure enough, after a brief delay there is the sound of footsteps on the stairs. The same waiter as before comes bearing two platters, one larger than the other. Fittingly enough, the smaller of the two is placed before The Empress and the other before Ulfang. \u201cFor milady, the omelette, and for m'lord, the venison. Excuse me.\u201dThe narrow staircase necessitates a second trip down and back up for the rice and wine stand, and a third for the wine itself. He brings two bottles: a red Rondi wine, as well as a rather scuffed bottle, its label lost, of what is in actuality Medanese Gold of the 203 vintage. At a motion from The Empress, he pours her a cup of the Rondi wine and leaves his corkscrew on the table.\u201cThe fiskesuppe will be ready soon, milord. The runners have just returned with the ingredients.\u201dThe waiter bows to each of them again, looks between them for any additional requests, and then excuses himself, leaving the mystery-wine unexplained and wishing that they \u201cEnjoy the meal.\u201d", "1594479698000": "Hearing Ulfang\u2019s comments about her administration, Naoki smirks, but holds her comment. She thanks the waiter, and watches him leave before taking up her utensils.\u201cOh no no no, certainly not! They\u2019re very gung-ho about their fresh fish here,\u201d she replies. \u201cIt\u2019s something of a fad \u2014 and if you ask me, something of a racket in league with the fishmongers guild.\u201d\u201cYou see, the clientele of this fine establishment are willing to pay exorbitant premiums for fresh seafood,\u201d she continues. \u201cSuch that it\u2019s apparently become profitable to employ a whole team of retired messengers to ride to and from the Port carrying little barrels with live fish and crustaceans in. There\u2019s a whole wing of the kitchen for it now, as not to stink up the food. They\u2019ll kill and gut the things right there, and have them served up on a platter for you mere minutes later, only an hour or two after it was yanked from the ocean, and for only twenty times or so what it should cost.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve had nothing to do with it,\u201d Naoki feels the need to clarify, \u201cAnd I sincerely doubt that any of the customers can tell the difference. I much preferred when parfaits were vogue, but...\u201d She shrugs, beginning to cut up her omelette. \u201cThey take pride in their work and keep it well away from me, so whatever tickles their fancy, I suppose. They\u2019re probably ecstatic to serve you \u2014 a King, and relish the challenge of being asked to prepare such an exotic dish. \u2026 I wonder how they\u2019ll do.\u201d\u201cAs for my bureaucracy...\u201d Naoki chuckles, amused by Ulfang\u2019s comment. \u201cIt is very efficient, yes. It moves swiftly and acts decisively, never at odds with itself, and always toward the same set of goals. There\u2019s very little inter-departmental correspondence and no time is wasted squabbling or in extraneous meetings. It\u2019s very effective and undoubtedly to what the state owes its rapid growth and continued prosperity.\u201dNaoki makes Ulfang wait as she chews a bite of her meal.\u201c\u2018But what\u2019s the secret?\u2019 you might ask. \u2018How is such a thing constructed?\u2019 \u2018What features does it have, and how does it do its job so well?\u2019\u201d Again, Naoki smirks, clearly enjoying herself with this bit.\u201cBut you know full well what features it has. You've already seen every inch of Isra\u2019s bureaucracy and are well on your way to knowing her better than most.\u201d Tapping her chest, Naoki indicates herself.\u201cThe rest of the government is essentially a mechanism to feed me information and carry out my orders; I make all high-level decisions. I don\u2019t micromanage save for the most critical of matters, but all strategic-level planning is me, as are decisions of budget and policy. To truly take leave for more than a few days I would need to grant more autonomy to officials throughout The Empire to stop things seizing up \u2014 which is a truly unappealing idea. More likely, I would lay out plans in advance, direct Liz to handle what isn\u2019t accounted for, and regularly confer with her to offer guidance where she\u2019s uncertain. It\u2019s doable, and I trust her to handle things in the event of an unforeseen absence on my part, but I would much prefer to have as small of a mess as possible to return to, come the end of whatever outing I may embark on.\u201d Again, she shrugs.At this point, The Empress\u2019s Omelette has been thoroughly diced into small pieces. She begins to eat in earnest, neglecting the wine for the time being. ", "1599179979000": "Naoki smiles weakly. Yes, it would be, and that\u2019s her problem.But then Ulfang recognizes his gift. Naoki\u2019s smile shifts to a smug smirk of self-satisfaction as he realizes exactly what she\u2019s served him, and she\u2019s happy to drop the sober subject.\u201cIt was a simple matter to send for some,\u201d she says, waving a hand to jokingly downplay the gesture. But she\u2019s clearly quite pleased with herself and takes Ulfang\u2019s response literally, considering for the space of a few moments what she more she might squeeze him for before waving that thought away as well. \u201c... Well, whatever it ends up being, get two, as I was able to find another bottle, which is to be your Yuletide gift.\u201d Raising her glass in a half-toast, Naoki sips her wine before pausing to gently swirl the remainder about and consider the man sitting opposite her.\u201cThat is perhaps my favorite part about being The Empress,\u201d she adds. \u201cThe ability to give meaningful gifts where-and-whenever they are deserved. \u2026 You\u2019ve certainly proven yourself as such,\u201d she supposes, chuckling to herself.", "1494501573000": "Around noon on an otherwise unremarkable Wednesday afternoon, two Citadel Guards enter Fletcher\u2019s Delectables. They come one after the other, complete with armor, spears, helmets, and suitably serious expressions. They move to stand at attention on either side of the inside of the doorway; their spears held upright. In behind them comes none other than High Lady Naoki, today wearing one of what must be an entire collection of sweater dresses. The fun thing about sweater-dresses, Naoki thinks, aside, of course, from being both a sweater and a dress, is that it\u2019s never too warm to wear one, assuming that the garment in question fits snugly and one wears absolutely nothing else save footwear. And this is indeed the case today. Approaching the counter, Naoki notes with pleasant surprise that there are not any other customers in the shop, which will leave her to peruse the shop\u2019s wonders undisturbed. And what confectionary wonders they are. Though this is the first time she has visited personally, Fletcher\u2019s Delectables seems to Naoki to be essentially as she thought it might be, having consumed its products and heard of it from those who have visited. As she reaches the counter, she places her bag down at her side and begins to explore the products on display, reading the names on labels and examining the contents of jars as she waits to be served.The second pair of Citadel Guards stands outside Fletcher's Delectables, blocking the entrance. ", "1494977676000": "As the man emerges from the back, Lady Naoki looks over to eye him. He must be the Fletcher of \u2018Fletcher's Delectables.' Though she didn\u2019t come with any particular preconceptions, he seems to Naoki very much like the sort of man that might run a candy shop.\u201cWell,\u201d Naoki begins, \u201cI will be quite honest with you, I\u2019m looking for some chocolate, and I hear this is the place to get it.\u201dReaching forward, Naoki extends one hand to delicately select one of the sample fudge squares, and places it into her mouth as if it were an hors d'oeuvre at a Gauldish social event. Somewhere in the motion, the toothpick disappears, never to be seen again. After a few moments of careful chewing, she nods, though without very much enthusiasm. Without being offered one, Naoki reaches forward to take another sample, and then, with her other hand, a third. With these in hand, Naoki turns her back on Renalt and takes a few steps toward the door. Extending her arms to either side, she offers these samples to the guards at the door. One accepts, and rather than attempting to transfer the toothpick from her delicate fingers to whatever sort of chain metal-nonsense that are his gauntlets, Naoki just drops it into his palm, and after removing the toothpick, he pops it into his mouth without complaint. The other guard opens his mouth in protest, and in a hushed tone, implies that if the samples have been poisoned or laced with a sleeping agent or some such, it would be exceptionally foolish for them all to have one. Further, it\u2019s bad policy for them, the guards, to eat anything while on duty, he insists. The other guard looks over, happily enjoying his square of fudge. He eyes the other, considering his partner something of a stickler. However, he\u2019s also somewhat concerned at this point, as there may be some manner of official regulation in place that he\u2019s just broken - that the High Lady has just tricked him into breaking. But such is not the case.The three then turn to focus on Renalt, as unassuming and charming a gentleman as he is. It doesn\u2019t seem as if he would offer poisoned fudge, Naoki thinks, and even if that is the case, there are more guards outside and other measures in place; she's not concerned. A second time, Naoki offers the sample to the guard, and he raises his palm, again declining it. With a small shrug, Naoki instead places it into her mouth and approaches the counter.After she\u2019s finished chewing, Naoki places her palms lightly on the edge of the counter and addresses Renalt, picking up right where she left off. \u201cTo begin with, I would like a variety of chocolate for myself. Something small and individual, only a bite per unit, and something that isn\u2019t messy.\u201dEmphasizing the last word, Lady Naoki means to imply she is not only looking for a product that won't smear itself on her, but also for a product that she may be willing to be seen in public eating, as The High Lady of Isra.", "1495171673000": "Taking the offered candies in her palm, Naoki chews with mild interest as Renalt proceeds to detail the origin of his \u201cEmmen-Ems.\u201d It certainly is a story, she admits. It seems like a good tale to tell one\u2019s young customers, to add a sense of wonder to the otherwise rather plain chocolates.\u201cMhmh,\u201d Lady Naoki says, nodding. \u201cQuite the practical treat; very good.\u201dGlancing back toward the wall of jars, she asks, \u201cWhat else do you have that would be reasonable to travel with?\u201d", "1495541007000": "Looking on with rapt attention as Renalt continues to display his wares, Lady Naoki smiles slightly to herself. Here is someone who is passionate in their work. This, Naoki has found, often correlates with authentic quality. Maelik and Epirus come to mind as examples, and if these treats taste as good as they look, Naoki thinks, this Fletcher will be among them.\u201cCaramel and butterscotch, certainly... smooth, sweet flavors,\u201d she responds. Placing one hand under her chin, Naoki again considers the items Renalt has presented so far and begins to form a mental list of those she intends to purchase. It quickly becomes a somewhat lengthy list. This, she decides, is a rather enjoyable experience. Visiting the candy store and being able to purchase all of the treats that seem appealing. Her thoughts drift to years past, and a similar situation shared with Artemis. Hurriedly setting those thoughts aside, Naoki looks to Renalt and asks another question. \u201cDo you do deliveries? Or- rather, do you offer the service of delivering, perhaps via messenger?\u201d", "1495833074000": "The High Lady seems skeptical the concept of chocolate acorns but takes one nonetheless, holding it between two fingers to look at it for a moment. It really does look like an acorn, she supposes, with different tones for the two parts and everything. It\u2019s only obvious in holding it and feeling the texture that it is chocolate, and the concept of such mimicry in edibles doesn\u2019t sit quite well with Naoki. But, it\u2019s chocolate, and it would be discourteous to decline after already having picked it up, so she tries it, and finds it to her liking. Nodding, she articulates as much. \u201cThose are quite good, I like the filling. \u2026 To begin with, I would like three individual bags of both turtles and the Emmen-Ems, a jar of those acorns, as well as a box of truffles.\u201d", "1495972668000": "As Renalt busies himself readying the chocolate, Lady Naoki bends to pick her bag up from the floor and puts it on the counter\u2019s surface. From within, she pulls a small coin pouch and places it in its entirety before Renalt without so much as opening it. He would find it to be partially filled with exclusively gold coins- worth significantly more than the order she\u2019s just placed. \u201cI will take these in my bag, thank you,\u201d she says, moving to transfer the packaged chocolates as she continues speaking.  \u201cWhat I would like you to deliver is one large box of your best fudge, to one-hundred-and-twelve Sunrise Boulevard. Sometime today would be ideal, but I would rather it be fresh than it be delivered quickly. I will also likely be sending messengers to pick up freshly made chocolates and conduct business on my behalf. You can expect them to arrive with proof of their identity probably sometime soon, as I doubt this will last very long.\u201dAs if to prove her point, Naoki pulls an acorn to eat from her jar before putting it away with the rest. After all of her newly acquired goodies have been stored away, she pulls her bag from the counter to hold in one hand, apparently finished transacting. ", "1496266387000": "Before Naoki has the chance to respond to Renalt, the sound of glass breaking has her ears turning toward the source of noise. The sound of breaking glass. Naoki herself turns on the spot a half-second later and finds the source- the window. Seeing the broken window, she gasps, eyes going wide. Her tail, which had been hanging casually behind her now inflates, and points straight up. In comparison to the composure used while doing business, Naoki now stands with feet apart, and arms held up about here torso.  A moment later, she notices the canister, only a few feet away from her on the floor. She stands frozen in shock as it opens and begins to spray its gas. With adrenaline levels high, Naoki\u2019s decision-making process is simple, \u201cGo. Get away from the gas.\u201d Completely disregarding both Renalt and her bag full of treats, Naoki bolts for the exit, holding her head down and one hand out in front to push the door open once she reaches it.  Meanwhile, the guards are not blind. Inside the shop, they notice the disturbance immediately and take it for a threat. Raising their weapons, the two look toward the window, but find no bodies coming through. Only the canister there on the floor, beginning to create a cloud of visible green gas. Their reactions, however, are not quite as fast as Naoki\u2019s and by the time the two of them have ascertained the situation, she is between them, one hand on the back of the door.  The pair of guards standing outside the door are alerted by the sound of breaking glass- only a few feet away from one of their heads. Immediately, they adopt a stance of readiness, hefting their spears up in front of them. Though neither of them saw the object as it was thrown, they both have been keeping a close watch on the street before them and the surrounding area, and did not see anything at all that could have broken the window. Was it magic? They don\u2019t know, though they are aware that whatever it was is not in front of them. Putting their heads on swivels, they look from side to side- nothing is apparent. Neither having spotted the source, the two take sideways steps toward each other, putting them back to back in front of the door.", "1497078263000": "Pushing the door open, Naoki proceeds directly out it at some speed. In doing so, she very nearly crashes into the backs of the guards standing just outside, spears raised. At this moment, Naoki\u2019s thought process gets far enough to wonder why, exactly, that thing came through the window.  The answer seems to come in the form of some manner of horrible creature scaling the building across the street. It\u2019s covered in eyes! With horns and armor and look at the way it\u2019s climbing up the building! Naoki and the guards reach a similar conclusion: they\u2019re being attacked by whatever that is, and they wouldn\u2019t like any part of it.  Naoki ducks her head, moving to put the two soldiers between herself and the other side of the street. Smacking one of them on the side, she addresses them, \u201cLeft, left, left!\u201d The two soldiers who had been left behind her in the shop emerge, and move to comply. The four of them face the creature (and by extension Noah), shuffling to the left as quickly as they can with Naoki behind them. As they move, they notice the second figure on the roof near the first but can do little else about it. With no forewarning, Naoki\u2019s earring starts to shine aggressively with magic as she begins to call for help while moving. Instincts tell her to dash forward- she can move much more quickly than any of these armored blokes could, and be down the street in only a handful of seconds. But to do that would put her in the open, and Naoki isn't quite frightened out of her sensibility yet, so she remains behind the guards, the wall to her other side.", "1527562666000": "The Empress enters.On this visit to Fletcher\u2019s Delectables, The Empress has chosen to wear her battle armor. It\u2019s very practical armor, dusky orange in color, shaped to her curves in a manner intended to inspire the troops. Elaborate filigree contrasts with plates polished to a mirror-like finish. The Sun is featured prominently in a few locations, and her name is written in script down the side of one arm. It doesn\u2019t make any noise as she approaches the counter, loaded to the brim with enchantments as it is. \"Mister Fletcher.\u201dHolding one hand in the other behind her back, she begins to browse the selection, idly glancing over the array of jars.\u201cHow is business?\u201d", "1527564254000": "\u201cCandy,\u201d she says, without looking up. \u201cI am here to purchase your \u2018delectables,\u2019 Fletcher.

Then she begins pointing fingers. \u201cTwo of those. \u2026 Five of those, two copper\u2019s worth of those little ones there on the end. Three of those jelly things, a few of those red ones...\u201dShe goes on for a bit longer, assembling an assortment of treats that look good to her. Not too many of any one item. \u201cAnd how much is that?\u201d she asks, gesturing to the bag.", "1527568720000": "\u201cMmmmh...\u201d She murmurs.\u201cA few more of these, the squares...

From it, the Empress takes five (very good-looking) gold coins and places them on the counter. She knows it\u2019s overpaying, he knows it\u2019s overpaying, but she doesn\u2019t say anything about it. \u201cThank you,\u201d The Empress says, taking the candy. \u201cYou are a valuable asset to Isra, and your skills are appreciated.

A Sentinel standing in the door is to see that she\u2019s not disturbed. As she sips her drink, she\u2019s hit by a wave of melancholy that\u2019s been haunting her for a long time. It\u2019s not the same. To anyone who had ever visited The Midnight Sun, The Starlight Dawn is astonishingly similar. Though somewhat larger, the builders were instructed to mimic The Sun as well as they could, and they\u2019ve done admirably in that goal. The same floorplan, the same types of wood, the same paintings on the wall, the same sort of candles, the same detailing on the banisters, and even the very same mural overhead, right down to the dimple on the cherub\u2019s bum.To most, The Starlight Dawn is just a bigger, better Midnight Sun in a more convenient location. Some even go so far to say that it was a good thing The Midnight Sun was destroyed because at least they have some elbow room now (haw haw haw.)But when such sour comments reach The Empress\u2019 pointed ears, they flatten against the top of her head in anger and abject disgust. Prior to her election, back when it was Madame instead of Empress, The Midnight Sun was Naoki\u2019s everything. The seat of her power, the sum of her wealth, her business, her organization, her base of operations, her family, and her home.After becoming Lady of Isra she no longer had time to stay at The Midnight Sun, what with a city to be responsible for and all. So she transferred management of The Sun to a trusted friend \u2014 Calico Shwartz, and began spending more and more time at The Citadel and abroad, administrating her domain, tending to the needs of her people and growing her empire. But as she cast her gaze further and further and as she set her goals higher and higher, as she brought Isra to new heights of power and prosperity, the life she had down in the little tavern gradually faded away, as did everyone in it.A few of her old friends stayed with her, and for that, she is grateful. Alden, Liz, and of course, Grandma \u2014 invaluable allies all; without them, neither she nor the world at large would be in as good of shape as they are today. But the rest are gone, their names forgotten. Left to pursue opportunities elsewhere. Killed by Goraia\u2019s artifact. Vanished into The Mists. Artificial body finally gave out. Assassinated. Dragged back to the Hellscape. Overdose. Several counts of killed in battle \u2026 And most of all, abandoned her in search of a fucking plant.Face contorted in anguish, Naoki is aware that she\u2019s just indulging the feeling at this point, but she doesn\u2019t care. This isn\u2019t the first time she has sat alone on the second-floor balcony and felt bad for herself, but it is the first time she\u2019s had to do it in this hollow mockery of a building. The bombing of The Midnight Sun was the last nail in the coffin; what was once hers is now gone, forever. She can\u2019t go sit in her office and remember the memories she made there; she can\u2019t order her old favorite dish and find comfort in its familiar taste. She can\u2019t look at the stains on the table and scuffs on the floor to remember how they were made, and she can\u2019t hear the familiar groan of the steps as she climbs them, because now it\u2019s all just splinters and rubble. For all the power she has \u2014 political, influential, cosmic, demonic, and otherwise \u2014 for all the gold in her vaults, \u2014 for all the Legionaries at her command and all the ships in her navy, \u2014 for all of her adoring subjects, all those lives that have been saved as a result of her decisions, and for all who have died in her name \u2014 for all of it, here she sits. Here sits The Empress, here sits Naoki. Alone. In the dark. In a replica that which she lost, drinking a replica drink out of a replica glass, lamenting what she used to have and how sorry she is for having lost it. The noise dampening runes in the table ensure that her wailing sobs can\u2019t be heard by the patrons below, but at this moment, she wouldn\u2019t even care if they did. She traded everything she had for the entire world and is only now appreciating the depth of her loss.

You will be instructed on the proper writing of the reports and what to do with them by the High Marshal, and, should the information you provide prove useful, you will be compensated. In gold.\u201dThat\u2019s the deal as The Empress lays it on the table. It doesn\u2019t sound as though she\u2019s asking, per se, but she looks to Fiona for her answer nonetheless.

About your clients, about other criminals, about the tidbits you overhear in crowded taverns. About the fences you use, the infiltration methods you\u2019ve taken advantage of, and the unwritten rules of your trades. About smuggling routes, hidden caches, secret signals, and codewords \u2014 all of it.\u201d\u201cYou will detail for me all of your contacts, tip-off none, and be truthful in your writing. You were not chosen by accident, by reputation, or on the merit of your looks alone \u2014 I know that you know enough to sit here with the High Marshal and give me enough information to earn that sack of gold.\u201cAnd, that you\u2019re capable of finding out a great deal more.

I take my duty as Empress very seriously, and my duty is not to protect Robert\u2019s coin purse. My duty is to provide for and protect my people, and part of that is keeping a strict leash on the crime that transpires within my domain. Preventing the black-market trade of goods that threaten the lives of thousands, monitoring the activities of potential assassins, and maintaining order in my city. I do this through the acquisition and effective use of information, and I do it quite well. I have an excellent idea of exactly how deep the underworld goes, along with how it works, who is in it, and what it accomplishes. I do not approve of those who systemically act in defiance of my laws, but, as Empress, I do not necessarily take issue with them all, either.\u201d\u201cFor example, I take no issue with you because you\u2019re more or less harmless. You don\u2019t aim to hurt anyone or cause any problems \u2014 you\u2019re just out in pursuit of coin, and I can hardly begrudge you that. I certainly don\u2019t approve of your stealing \u2014 I would of course rather you not, but it is no concern of mine.

Consider this thread a direct continuation of the old one, nothing has changed with the setting.Here\u2019s a flavorless summarization of the current situation to ease this transition. Please refer to the end of the old topic for full details. Empress Naoki   is in her office with Artemis   and Alden Marshal  . Rarraennan \"Cynder\" K'talon  is in the hall just outside, having just spoken with Takhana Veil  . Reese Cresno   is in his office, and Takhana has just entered his office and introduced herself. @magthok   is outside the front door with a plate of meat. All other present characters are idle, going about their business around the building. Madame Naoki nods to Takhana as she exits, taking Cynder with her. Reaching into a drawer in her desk, Naoki places a bottle of strange, crimson ink onto the table. Made from a particular blend of herbs and magical reagents, this ink is designed to be highly resilient to magical tampering and erasure. Naoki sometimes uses it to create unalterable contracts or sensitive documents that ought to be protected. Using a new quill, Naoki begins to create an identical set of documentation, using the crimson ink to create a set of documents that Takhana will be able to read. There are a considerable number of documents to be copied, between the citizenship registration, employee information forms, and employment contracts, as well as the non-disclosure agreement Takhana will need to sign to work with Reese in the business of information. The work itself is tedious, simply copying from one piece of paper to the next. As Naoki proceeds, she addresses Alden, keeping her gaze focused downward on the task at hand. \u201cSo, Alden. If I might, could you tell me a bit about your friend outside? Is there much more to say, beyond that you purchased an ogre, and would like to have him put to work?\u201d", "1457291160000": "\u201cHm.\u201dMadame Naoki\u2019s response is short and non-committal. Her quill continues to dance along the parchment as she considers the issue. \u201cThere are worse and less valuable things to have than an orge, I suppose. From what I understand of ogres, he exhibited an uncharacteristic amount of self control and intelligence in not attacking anyone downstairs and following your instructions. \u2026 I wonder why. All of the information I\u2019ve consumed paints the entire race as a bunch of non-intelligent, bloodthirsty monsters. Yet, yours followed an order, and recognizes you as its superior. Strange\u2026\u201dHaving finished transcribing one of the more lengthy contracts, Naoki sets it aside, and gives Alden her full attention. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that I don\u2019t currently have any standard staffing opportunities that would be suited for an individual such as \u2018Maggy\u2019. I've got lots of openings for cute young ladies and handsome gentlemen willing to serve food, but not really anything that he would be suited for. I\u2019ll keep my eyes open, but can\u2019t take him off your hands directly. Understanding that you would be opposed to deporting or otherwise removing him, I don\u2019t have much more to say beyond \u201cHe\u2019s sort of your responsibility, so you should decide what to do with him.\u201d  You could try to find him a job around the city, and pass him off to someone else. He\u2019s big and strong, would probably make for an excellent laborer. Or he might also have a place in the military, I would have to imagine he\u2019d be very useful to them. Or alternatively, you could keep him around, and have him assist you with your work. There are a lot of situations that would be easily remedied by having a massive, armed and armored ogre at your command, I\u2019m sure. I\u2019m willing to cover the costs of keeping him around, if you\u2019re willing to deal with the fellow. Or if he\u2019s intelligent enough to appreciate the concept of employment, employ him as an operative- though you\u2019d still be responsible for handling him.\u201dHaving finished saying her bit, Naoki turns back down to continue copying the paperwork for Takhana, though she keeps an ear trained in Alden\u2019s direction as she awaits a response. ", "1457592692000": "Madame Naoki glances back up from the paperwork as Cynder enters the room, and watches quietly as she speaks to Alden. What is it? She can\u2019t quite tell. It\u2019s almost certainly related to whatever Takhana had told her in the hall. Naoki briefly considers asking Reese what was said, but decides against it in favor of some semblance of integrity. Instead, she interjects with a short statement of her own, speaking carefully to Alden and Cynder. \u201cIf any of you would like to request my assistance with whatever is going on, know that I would be pleased to offer my assistance however I can. If you\u2019d like to speak somewhere privately, I can offer you the use of my sitting room- just over there, and if you decide to accept my offer, the paperwork is ready over here, Cynder.\u201dWith the tip of her quill, Naoki points to first to the door on the left side of the room, and then to the neatly stacked set of parchment on the desk, and the writing supplies set neatly to one side. Whenever Cynder is finished attending to whatever dire matter currently has her attention, the paperwork will be waiting. With that said, Naoki turns back downward and continues to work on transcribing the documents for Takhana. The door to the sitting room is closed, but not locked, and it remains exactly as it was when it was last used. ", "1458777725000": "The door swings open, creaking slightly on its hinges. Though the hinges are very well made, the creaking is intentional. The door cannot be opened without making noise, and as an extension, alerting everyone inside- a sort of security feature built directly in, and maintained simply by negligence in oiling the hinges. Regardless, the door opens, revealing the figure of Madame Naoki. Having only just gotten back from St. James Boutique, she is in the process of preparing for the trip to Gauldin; various papers and documents related to diplomacy, foreign policy, and etiquette are littered all across her desk. Her hair is a bit out of sorts, and she adjusts it slightly as she greets Aithen. \u201cAithen, hello. How can I help you?\u201d", "1458801458000": "Naoki steps back out of the way as Aithen moves past her into the room, mildly surprised at his forwardness. She doesn\u2019t often demand much more than basic etiquette, but Aithen had been massively respectful during their previous meetings. This must be quite important to him. She listens quietly as he says his bit, and raises an eyebrow in some combination of curiosity and confusion. She responds in a decidedly neutral, polite, and questioning tone. \u201cWhat do you mean by that? I consider myself a fairly capable individual, at least when it comes to meeting and speaking. What additional \u2018preparations\u2019 must you make to me to ready me for his arrival?\u201dThough it doesn\u2019t infect her voice, Aithen\u2019s words stir up feelings of concern. She hardly expected Thorok, who is quite presumably an orc of some description, to operate at the height of royal etiquette. Hell, based on her information as it stands now, she wouldn\u2019t even bet on him being able to read Common. What sort of strange rituals must he have for visiting people? Does Aithen intend to try to... modify her appearance, or attire? Hmph. She\u2019d like to see him try. She decides: if Thorok won\u2019t meet with her fully clothed, or as an equal, she wouldn\u2019t see him at all. ", "1458905610000": "As Aithen carries on with his suggestions, Naoki listens carefully and watches his movements, her eyebrow never lowering from its raised position. Her first response is neutral and non-committal. \u201cI see.\u201dShe reviews in her mind\u2019s eye all that Aithen has just said, and begins to develop conclusions. Thorok is the leader of the orc tribe, Falkreath. He\u2019s coming, now, to speak with her. Presumably arriving within the next short while, judging by Aithen\u2019s hurried tone. But\u2026 why? What business does he have with her, in her office? If it\u2019s a matter of state, surely he would be better served by simply approaching The Citadel. Perhaps it\u2019s related to one of the matters relating directly to her men. By the way that Aithen is describing the etiquette, it doesn't seem as if he\u2019s coming to attempt anything funny, either. Simply a meeting. But what about, and why now? Most of the described custom seems to make sense, insofar as much as the high customs of relatively barbaric and remote orc tribes seem to go, at least. \u201cI understand what you suggest, thank you for your information, and will bear your input in mind. But answer me this, Aithen. Does Thorok have a habit of simply... turning up like this, with essentially no prior warning, and without invitation? He\u2019s lucky to have caught me during a period in which I am available to speak, and am not attending one of my duties or am out of my office. I don\u2019t mean to imply that I wouldn\u2019t like to meet him or that he requires an invitation, but I would have much rather had adequate time to prepare for his arrival, you understand? I\u2019m also sort of in the middle of doing this here, preparing for a trip, and am going to have to adjust my whole schedule to fit this meeting in. Do you know why he intends to speak with me right at this moment, and do you have a translation of \u201cThuri\u201d? I\u2019m not going to call him something I don\u2019t understand the meaning behind.\u201d", "1459035856000": "Mar 25, 2016 5:40:26 GMT -8  @aithen said:The Lionkin cut off a growl that began to grow. The sudden questions seemed to have offended Aithen and his ways of a tribal member. Staring to the ground away from Naoki for a moment, his face grew to a snarl, tongue seen pinched by sharp fangs as he argued in his mind what exactly to say to her sudden critique.\"These orcs are not of general itinerary. Back then, during the ages from before, before Isolation, they were respected as rare, significant, ancient beings. And now.. now it seems that even their sudden notice to present themselves is nothing but a disturbance.\" He looked back to Naoki, answering her question. \"This is a habit, yes, but the time to travel takes a day at least. And this... 'habit' isn't practiced often, as a matter of fact, this is the first in years. One would be honored, should be honored.\" He cut himself off of the prideful speech as he looked back to the wall for a moment, then to Naoki again as he constructed what to say. \"Thuri... that is the term they've called one another. I know not of their tongue, but I've seen the officials greet each other with such a term. That, or Uthri, but such a title seems more important, and should be called to people that caller thinks higher than them.\" Taking a breath, he continued. \"I know not of his intentions, nor his reasons to come here. But I do know, that his is a rarity, something that will happen once in every couple decades.\" He waited for a response, beginning to march his way to the side of the room, staring to the door as he stood tall. \"Are there any other questions... Uthri?\" He decided he would call her as such to place some subconscious reminder to use the separate term, and maybe even try to impress her at that point in time as well.As Aithen turns away, Naoki\u2019s brow furrows slightly. She hadn\u2019t meant to imply anything, simply that she was preparing to go speak with the King of Gauldin- arguably another important figure, and even so much as a day\u2019s notice would have been sufficient to properly prepare for Thorok\u2019s arrival. Still, this is apparently thing now, happening right now. Orc Chieftain coming to speak with her for goodness knows why. Best to roll with the punches, she muses. \u201cAlright, then, Aithen. I have no further questions. Thank you for informing me, even this small advance warning will allow me to prepare to some limited extent. I\u2019ll be sure to speak highly of your valued contributions, and show him all due respect. If you\u2019d like, you can escort him up here from the door.\u201d", "1459040224000": "(To clarify, I\u2019m doing that thing that I said that I would never do again, where I have three conversations at once. The timeline is such that immediately following Naoki\u2019s return from the Boutique, she met with Alden, Cynder and Takhana. Regardless of how that meeting ends up resolving herself, she then met with Aithen and now Thorok, and then departed for Gauldin the next morning. I\u2019m going to be quoting posts to keep the simultaneous conversations on this topic as clear as possible to all readers.)Oh, right now, right now. Naoki's\u2019 ears turn to listen as Thorok thumps his way up the stairs, and her earring glimmers slightly as Reese relates information. She doesn\u2019t have time to move into any sort of position or change her outfit before Thorok is upon them, standing there, filling up the doorway, making eye contact. She stands upright, maintaining eye contact and taking just the barest of moments to examine the guy. Big sort of muscular and lumpy fellow, obviously, but his face. Wrinkled with the scars of battle, but also with other wrinkles. Of age and stress, perhaps.However, without much of a better plan, she proceeds to continue following Aithen\u2019s advice, raising her right fist to sit atop her chest, and maintaining eye contact. Though the word is foreign to her, she speaks it, doing her best to mimic Aithen\u2019s pronunciation.\u201cHail, Thuri.\u201dIn addition, she inclines her head slightly, still maintaining eye contact. This is mostly habit, and she realizes she\u2019s doing it after she\u2019s already inclined her head, and hopes that it isn\u2019t some massive show of disrespect in orcish culture. She doesn\u2019t think that it would come off as such, such a simple and mildly submissive gesture as a nod, but the possibility exists in her mind.

His eyes traveled to Aithen for a moment, before returning to Naoki's to lock once more, his own flexing a bit with surprise at that term. From there, he waited a moment, before bringing his own fist up to his chest, firmly resting as he responded with his own voice.\"Hail, Thuri.\"From there, his voice was quite powerful. It wasn't too deep, yet held a masculine level of volume. He seemed older than he was, and his voice appeared to have been warned out at one point, due to the low grumbling sound emitted during the 'Hail' part of the greeting. Either that, or he still has trouble with the English tongue.From there, the Chieftan spread his fist to a flat hand, resting it against his chest and lowering it to signal the end of the salutation. Shyly, the Chieftan marched forward, looking down next to him (To his right) to see the chair he was offered to sit in. His head pivoted to look back up to Naoki for a moment, exhaling through his calm nostrils as he nodded weakly, sitting down. From there, his back was straight (possibly not even touching the back rest), his chest was puffed out, his eyes remaining to lock onto hers, yet kept his head as level as possible while doing so.As he sat down, however, his muscles rippled within his legs, flexing and tensing up with even the smallest of movements. His skirt folded more in between his legs, the skull as its buckle pushing the top of its horns into his midsection, right against the outer sides of his abs. The scars upon his body could be viewed now to be more of indents: Deep, fatal wounds even possibly viewed to have subsided and rejuvenated from whatever concoctions or spells the Frok'Nold have used for so long. At this point in time, his mighty, battle-worn eyes looked up and down upon Naoki, gesturing with a weak raise of his hand for her to do the same. \"It is tradition we are allowed one look upon the entirety of the body before our words escape it.\"\u00a0Thorok spoke once more, his face continuing it's slightly angry, yet neutral, stare to her eyes, waiting for her to view him. One would guess what he meant as \"words escaping the body\" as he spoke just at that time to explain it. But truly, it was a reference to the beginning of the meeting and its issues.\u00a0\"I bear no dagger, on my honor.\" This would give off a hint of why this tradition was as so. Many times in the past had \"peaceful\" meetings gone to a hidden weapon thrown at the other, or perhaps unwanted gazes down to the rest of the body upon later time during the meeting.\"....What do you know, of my people?\" Questioned the now deeper voice of Thorok. His eyes narrowed down to Naoki in interest, flickering over to witness Artemis in the same form as Aithen was on the other side of the room. He appreciated it, yes, but he would have to speak to Aithen later on due to this unneeded force upon their own tradition of greeting.Madame Naoki stands and watches quietly as Thorok repeats the greeting, speaks, and seats himself. If her mind could be compared to a gearbox, one might be able to hear it whirring away, well oiled rotations of finely cut gears struggling to fully observe and analyze all of Thorok\u2019s actions. In situations such as these, where she has little to information, Naoki finds herself forced to rely on improvisation and on-the-spot decision making. Further, in such high-stakes situations as these, she doesn\u2019t much like having being forced in that way. Only a few minutes before, she had been reviewing information on King Renaux, so she wouldn\u2019t have to do this same sort of thing tomorrow. However, if she\u2019s good at anything, she\u2019s good at analyzation. The first thing that she notes is that Thorok is very careful not to break eye contact for any extended length of time. She has no idea of the symbolism behind this, but assumed it to be related to respect, and figures it best not to break the trend. Proceeding forward, she will be careful not to break eye contact. As he sits and states that he is unarmed, she hesitates for a moment before reaching to the pouch on her hip, and fumbles with the string holding it to her hip. Without looking at it, she takes a moment to undo the know, but dexterous fingers prevail in the end, and place the pouch on the desk to her side. The gems inside clink slightly as it finds a resting position atop a stack of books. Though it doesn\u2019t resemble any conventional weapon, some of the gems in there are capable of flattening towns, and are definitely weapons in the sense that they could be used to easily take action to disable Thorok. Though she doesn\u2019t usually disarm herself when speaking to others, and even has a habit of fooling with gems as she speaks, that habit will need to be curbed for this meeting. Regardless of the purpose of his visit or what comes of it, Thorok seems to be an incredibly intense sort of individual, and she assumes that her meeting with Renaux tomorrow will be significantly more casual than this. If things do end up turning sour, the inability for her to utilize the gems will not be a significant strategic loss, their power and applicability is trivial when compared to Reese\u2019s defensive magics across the hall. Even now, she feels a slight tickling on her lower back as he silently flexes his abilities, as it were. Moving from the desk, she breaks eye contact momentarily to glance down at the seat to the left of the door. She looks back up at Thorok, and states the truth, \u201cI too, am unarmed.\u201d With that, she seats herself, carefully weaving her tail through the space between the cushion and backrest, and resting her hands in her lap. At this point, it is worth congratulation that Madame Naoki maintains her composure. She looks across to Thorok, the hulking, 7\u20194\u201d sort of terribly muscular orcish individual that he is, simply sitting there in her guest chair a measly four feet from her. The whole encounter brings to mind a similar situation- when she first met Maelik. Though she supposes that Thorok would find it massively disrespectful if she burst out laughing as she did then, with any luck, this should turn out into an equally mutually prosperous relationship. When he poses his question, Naoki waits a half-moment before answering, considering. When she speaks, it is in her own, relatively light tone, with inflections of neutrality and respect. \u201cI do not know very much about your people. I have heard of a settlement called Falkreath, and have heard some firsthand accounts from visitors, and some legends that would seem to be referring to your people. However, I cannot say that I truly know your people.\u201dShe sits quietly and awaits his response, or lack of it. If he chooses not to speak, she would continue, but figures what she said to be sufficient enough for the moment.", "1459154378000": "Mar 27, 2016 19:08:27 GMT -8 Lorelei & Lucia said:\"Really?\"The twins giggle again, watching Skarlet.She doesn't know where milk comes from?This should be fun.Let's go to Madame Naoki and ask her.

Let's go see Madame Naoki, she'll tell us!\"They stand to either side of Skarlet and each take one of her hands. Gripping firmly, they lead her up to Naoki's office.\"Madame Naoki! Miss Skarlet has a question for you!\"As they wait, they both look up at the tall and busty vampire.\"How much work is it to wear that, really? It doesn't look like very much, so it can't be that heavy...\"Some time after Thorok\u2019s departure, a new set of interruptions knock on Naoki\u2019s door. After a short delay, it swings inward on creaking hinges, revealing yet again the form of Madame Naoki herself. Her desk is still piled high with books and documents pertaining to tomorrow\u2019s trip, and her hair is done up into a small, spiral sort of bun on the back of her head. This configuration draws to attention to the lack of ears on the sides of her head- she\u2019s found that some find it unsettling. It isn\u2019t so much the addition of non-human body parts, but the absence of such a common one. Regardless, Naoki is past caring at this point; she has no appointments scheduled right now, any visitors are invited, and will have to deal with her appearance as it is. The first person she sees as the door opens is Skarlet, there in her outfit. Naoki begins to smile, but also pans her gaze downward, and sees the twins. She stops smiling, instead choosing to nod at the group of them. She beckons inside, and gestures to the guest chairs, which have been returned to their original positions. \u201cGirls. Come in, what can I do for you?\u201d", "1459160314000": "As Skarlet poses her question, Naoki\u2019s face develops an expression of mild exasperation tinged with disappointment. She sighs, and shakes her head slightly. Skarlet really does not know this sort of thing. But she can\u2019t be blamed for it, Naoki supposes. \u201cI really am going to have to educate you properly, aren\u2019t I. Come on in, then.\u201dNaoki beckons inward once again, and takes her own seat across the desk. She placed a bookmark in the tome currently occupying the forefront of her workspace, and moves it to one side. Assuming that Skarlet sits, Naoki leans back in her chair, planting her feet up on one corner of the desk, and begins her explanation. \u201cTo answer your question simply, milk of the sort that human infants drink comes from the mother\u2019s breasts. However, let me give you a bit of context to explain that answer. First of all, this following information only pertains to mammals, as they are regularly understood. That means\u2026 things that have hair, and breasts. Creatures like you and me, but also things like cows, and\u2026 bears\u2026 and cats and dogs and horses and such. Not fish, not birds, not reptiles, not undead, nor animated skeletons or dragons or any of that nonsense.\u201d\u201cCreatures that are mammals give birth to their young, in a manner that is, generally speaking, essentially the same as the human reproductive system we discussed previously, with the eggs and all that. You figure, after that, once the infant is born, it falls to the mother to provide for the infant until it is capable of operating and sustaining itself autonomously. That means feeding it, taking care of it, protecting it from danger, and generally taking steps to ensure the child survives until adulthood. \u2026 Hmm. Have you ever seen a newborn child, Skarlet?\u201dAs Naoki poses her question, she raises one eyebrow in Skarlet\u2019s direction. It\u2019s entirely possible that Skarlet may not have ever seen a newborn child.", "1459165602000": "\u201cHm. Well, you\u2019re not missing much, but you should probably refer to a book or go find one to have a look at later. However, for the purposes of our discussion, imagine a little person\u2026 at birth, human babies usually tend to range between two and a half kilograms to four and a half kilograms. Little, tiny things, maybe\u2026\u201dNaoki flattens her hands and holds them out to indicate a distance of about forty centimeters. \u201cThis big, though they vary in size some. Not very large at all. Also not very strong, or capable of doing anything much at all by themselves. This early on in development, the infant\u2019s body- brain and all, is still growing at an incredible pace, but doesn\u2019t yet have the capacity to do really much of anything. They have to be, as the term has been named, babied. To be cared for, treated, pampered. In almost all scenarios, the responsibility for caring for the child goes to the mother. In some cases, the father may take a large role, and midwives are a thing that exist, but generally speaking, it\u2019s up to the mother.\u201d\u201cTo return to your question, as I stated, one of the responsibilities of the mother is to feed the child. At this point, the infant\u2019s mouth and digestive system are not capable of processing solid foods at all. They don\u2019t even have teeth yet, those come in later. They cannot chew or digest anything that isn\u2019t a liquid. And, on top of that, there are only a small handful of liquids that are nutritious enough to sustain the rapid development of a newborn child, and all but one of them can be mixed by Kevin. That one remaining liquid that Kevin cannot create is breast milk. You see, one of the changes that occurs in a mother\u2019s body during the process of pregnancy and childbirth is lactation. Lactation means, essentially, to secrete milk, and\u2026 well, women do that.\u201d\u201cYou figure, the nipples, the little raised bits on one\u2019s breasts...\u201d She indicates by tapping her fingers on the front of her sweater. \u201cThey secrete milk following childbirth. The idea then is to hold the infant sort of like this\u2026 and they go ahead and suck it out.\u201d She continues to pantomime, holding one arm in the other and mimicking the clamping lips of an infant with two fingers. \u201cThe mother\u2019s milk is the infant\u2019s single source of nutrition for about the first six months after birth. Past that point, through a process known as weaning, the mother then begins to supplement the child\u2019s diet with other things. Usually mashed fruits and vegetables, things that are runny and liquid. At this point, though the child\u2019s digestive system is advanced enough to handle some things other than breast milk, it still has a hard time with some things, and feeding the baby the wrong thing at this point will at least end with a very upset stomach, and at worst leave the child with a serious health issue. One must be very, very careful with young children, in matters of food, and in all other respects. One mistake or show of neglect may evolve into a very serious problem, and endanger the life of the child. Unfortunately, due to this massive vulnerability in the early stages of life, a depressingly large number of human children do not reach adulthood.\u201dHere, Naoki pauses for a moment, closing her eyes apparently in mourning, before continuing. \u201cBut I digress. Human children drink from their mother\u2019s breasts for the first half year or so after being born, before gradually switching to other sorts of food, and eventually becoming able to consume the regular sorts of things humans tend to. The process of female lactation is almost always related to pregnancy, though it can be induced with some manners of drugs, and is sometimes seen in adoptive mothers. Most probably something to do with feelings, I imagine. Other sorts of mammals also use this same process, and it is through the efforts of ranchers milking their livestock, notably cows, goats, and sheep, that we get milk to drink. I really don't know how you even intend on having a child in the first place, if you'd begin to lactate, or if the vampire children would need blood, so I can't help you much there, but does that adequately answer your question?\u201dNaoki fixes Skarlet with another look and raised eyebrow, still leaning back in her chair and crossing her arms over her chest. ", "1459167798000": "\u201cGood, that\u2019s the goal. In lieu of any of that, it\u2019s still my job to educate you on how to function and be capable in today\u2019s world. To that end, I\u2019d like to start having regular sessions with you, wherein I set aside some time, perhaps a couple hours each week, most days of the week, to meet with and educate you. There are still an awful lot of things you don\u2019t know about the world, and I feel obligated to help you alleviate that issue personally. I\u2019ll have a look at my schedule and get back you about it later, but unless you\u2019re terribly opposed to the idea, we should start doing that soon. I suggest considering what sorts of things you might like to learn about first, we can tailor your lessons to suit your interests. \u201dRemoving her legs from the desktop, Naoki stands from her seat, slides the book back before her, and moves to open the door so that Skarlet and The Twins may exit. \u201cWith that said, however, I\u2019m currently preparing for tomorrow\u2019s trip. We\u2019ll speak about this later, but for the time being, I need to get back to it.\u201dWith a wave of her arm, she indicates the hallway. Leaving the arm outstretched, she also extends the other in a suggested stance for a hug as Skarlet presumably stands to exit. ", "1459290290000": "Naoki listens quietly as he continues to relate the story of the Frok'Nold, careful to keep her hands folded in her lap. What a story it is, too, assuming he is to be believed. Though he has no particular reason to distrust him, the fantasticality of his tale lends to some mild doubts, and the ambiguity of his words leave some things to be interpreted. He may be embellishing or exaggerating, relating the facts he was taught. However, it\u2019s probably best to take it all at face value for the time being, and reassess later. As the name Rag'Novok is mentioned and explained, full realization dawns. So that\u2019s what that massive stone dragon was, months ago en route to The Chalet. A weapon-creature created by some old gods of the Frok'Nold, designed to halt the progress of other civilizations. When it had been claiming ownership of the mountains, it had thought itself to be in the right. But then again, she supposes, \u2018right\u2019 is, by its nature, only relative. After he finishes, she nods, solemnly and respectfully, thinking herself to have understood and digested all that he said. She considers her response for a moment before stating it. \u201cTo whom do you refer? As I recall, I have only dispatched a single individual to visit your settlement, Artaxerxes . He is a tool sharpener by trade, and I sent him visiting to learn of your people. Though he did choose to attempt to lend his hand to assist your people, he did not tell me of any oaths taken. When he realized that his talents and equipment were insufficient to deal with your issue, he withdrew in the interest of preserving his own life. I apologize that he wasn\u2019t able to assist as fully as we both would have liked, but there isn\u2019t much to be done about it at this point, besides moving forward in the best possible manner. If you\u2019d like, I could send someone else, and I would be happy to cooperate in some other way, but I see little that can be done to remedy Artaxerxes  's shortcomings as they apply to the past.\u201d", "1459432791000": "As Thorok abruptly stands to leave, Naoki raises a hand to wave respectively in farewell. \u201cUntil we meet again, then.\u201dShe remains seated for a long few moments after he\u2019s left, sitting, hands folded in deep thought, attempting to process all that he said before departing. She motions first to @artemeis, \u201cTranscribe all of that.\u201d She would need to look over all that which was said later, when she has more time to think about it.

There was nothing wrong with staying somewhere for a while and enjoying oneself.And on top of that, it was certainly nice to have a place to call home. Thinking about it, made her tear up a bit.\u201cWell, you figure that I have a lot of agendas to further. Improving The Midnight Sun as a business, protecting and improving Isra, my own personal interests, as well as those of my friends and allies. To get things done, I need people to do them, and oftentimes, I need things done beyond the walls of Isra. In far-away nations, remote settlements, and sometimes the untamed wilderness.\u201d\u201cThe job description would be mostly left general, but the basic idea behind that would be that I would give you a task, which would usually follow a format of \u201cGo to X location, and do Y task\u201d. Sort of like the errand Cecil asked you to do, but on a much larger scale, and significantly less mundane than purchasing confections. You could use the term \u2018odd jobs\u2019 if you\u2019d like, but oftentimes they\u2019re really more like \u2018missions\u2019 or \u2018operations\u2019. I already have a handful of individuals who do this sort of work, but your skills would be a significant and welcome addition, I\u2019m sure. That, and you\u2019d likely have the opportunity to learn from my other operatives, some of whom are very skilled.\u201d", "1460139290000": "Apr 8, 2016 9:10:17 GMT -8 Elizabeth Finch said:\"Now works just fine ma'am. I'll start with the status of the refugees. You were correct that they are planning on joining the city. Lord Seryl told me that they are planning on arriving en masse tomorrow. I informed that my platoon and I will be on hand to ensure there are no misunderstandings with the on duty guards. They seem like a strong group, their camp was about as orderly as one can expect given their situation but the people were inquisitive, if a bit shy. As for Lord Seryl himself, he plans on offering his services to our government. He wants to reclaim his homeland, but understands he has not the ability to do so at the moment. He seems very capable, humble even. He is unused to command and does not want it, but has done what is best for his people anyway. They lookup to him as their leader. I would strongly urge us to take him aboard. He would make a valuable ally.\"That, and she wouldn't mind seeing him again, he seemed like a good sort, and she could use a new friend in the city, her dedication to her work did not leave much time for such things.\u201cHmm. I see, I see\u2026\u201dThere is a momentary pause as Madame Naoki digests the information and decides what she thinks of it. \u201cThat would seem to work out very well, then. I\u2019m obviously not going to be around to handle their entrance tomorrow, so unless a higher authority tells you otherwise or assumes the responsibility themselves, you should consider yourself as in charge of handling this event. You should make it clear that if these refugees intend to make Isra their new home, they are obligated to file valid citizenship paperwork within a reasonable time from the date of their of their immigration. I\u2019ll send some workers over with the paperwork, and give them instructions to follow your direction. Don\u2019t bother forcing each refugee to file their papers tomorrow; they\u2019re going to be tired, and it\u2019s unreasonable to expect them all to fill out a bunch of paperwork before coming through the gates, but make sure that they know that will have to at some point, and try to make the paperwork accessible somewhere in the event that some of them would like to do it immediately.\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s also the non-insignificant matter of where to put all of these refugees. Though I\u2019m not quite sure how many of them there are, I sincerely doubt that there are enough vacant houses in the city to house them all, and most of them don\u2019t have the funds on hand to purchase a home anyway. Hm. For the time being, we\u2019ll have to rely mostly on the welcoming arms of Isra\u2019s people and the accommodations I can arrange at the Inn and such. If you have the opportunity, play up sympathy for the refugees, and encourage homeowners to consider accepting tenants. I think\u2026 I think I\u2019ll organize a construction event in the coming days, and provide the materials for them to build their own houses. That should go over well.\u201d\u201cAs for this Lord Seryl, if you think him competent and wouldn\u2019t mind doing so, I suggest doing your best to befriend him personally. You\u2019re in an excellent position, having met with him earlier, planning to meet with him again tomorrow, as well as having my\u00a0resources\u00a0to draw on, to welcome him into the fold. Do everything you can to assist him and his group; and give positive impressions.\"", "1460148598000": "\u201cIf you think that would be a good service to offer him, feel free to do so. I think I\u2019ll have the boys run some sort of special for Medanese nationals tomorrow. However, depending on his mood and the way he handles himself, he might be cheered up by the atmosphere in The Sun, or he might be further depressed. Keep in mind you\u2019re dealing with a man whose entire family was likely killed or forced into slavery, and he probably doesn\u2019t know for sure, and didn\u2019t get the chance to properly say goodbye. Even if he does seem to be handling things well on the surface, I would bet you a substantial sum that the emotional turmoil he- and the rest of the refugees- are going through is intense. Play it by ear, and bear in mind emotions are still running high.\u201d\u201cAs for jobs, I\u2019ll probably end up hiring a substantial number of the refugees myself. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ve mentioned to you, but I am planning on opening a forge. Some of them will probably be able to find work there, but in the end, they\u2019re going to have to find work around the city just like everyone else who has moved to Isra. You might be able to pick out a few potential soldiers from the lot, and direct them toward The Citadel, and hopefully a number of them will open new businesses, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019ll be too much of a problem.

Anyway, that\u2019s a useful bit of information, but not so much for me. I\u2019m going to pass that information on up the chain to Ildesias Xen Torsal , and to The Enclave of Isranian Magi ; perhaps those bookish sorts over at The Enclave can tell us more about what sorts of magic they might be using, and begin considering how to disrupt or counteract it, should the need arise.

He walked across the main floor, pushing his way through the throngs of drunkards with skeins in their hands. As he arrived at the staff staircase, he walked up it, leaning against the wall and taking his helmet off. Beneath, of course, was the familiar face of Cyronin the Blue, agent of the Midnight Sun. He opened his room, tossing the helmet on the bed and sighing. The room was swelteringly hot, as a result of the curtains and door having been closed for the last few months as he went about his missions in the foreign lands. He walked to the window, pulling the curtains apart and pushing the glass panes up, sighing, pleased by the feeling of the sun on his face and breeze in his hair. Next to go on the bed was his sword, belt, boots, and gloves, followed by his chest piece and greaves, before he could finally sit down on the ground in his underclothes, relaxing as he waited for the Madame or Reese to contact him for his next assignment. The next time Cyronin the Blue \u00a0picks up his sword, the voice of Madame Naoki would be waiting for him, courtesy of the gemstone embedded into its pommel. \u201cCyronin. I hope you haven\u2019t been getting too comfortable; I\u2019ve got another job for you. This time, a reconnaissance mission. I\u2019d like you to approach the Goraian border, and visually observe their fortifications. We\u2019ve recently received information that they may be using large scale mind control on their citizens, and I\u2019d like to investigate the rumors in a non-intrusive manner. You probably won\u2019t see anything much, but I\u2019d still like someone to look. I realize that this is a task that could be accomplished with scrying spells, but I suspect that they have wards in place to prevent that, and may not take kindly to magic being cast on them from Isra- scrying magic can sometimes be traced. So to play on the safe side, I\u2019m sending you, because you\u2019re overqualified. You should prepare with heavy magical defensive equipment and observation tools, as well as supplies to exist in the wilderness for a prolonged period of time. Oh, and prepare enough for two- I\u2019m considering sending one of our newest operatives with you to gain experience.\u201d", "1460214427000": "Madame Naoki\u2019s face within the orb shakes, signaling a negative answer. \u201cNot particularly, no.

I would prefer if- unless the task requires otherwise- you keep a low profile, and don\u2019t needlessly kill or draw attention to yourself or your activities, but if you figure that the best way to accomplish whatever the goal is, and it doesn\u2019t negatively impact anything else, you won\u2019t hear any complaints from me.\u201d", "1460215100000": "\u201cNothing I\u2019m aware of right now, no.

That shouldn\u2019t be more than a few days, though, so you can consider them complete, for all intents and purposes. The last thing you\u2019re going to need is one of the gemstones I mentioned.

After giving Leona a moment to understand that it\u2019s there, she sits back up and begins to speak again,\u00a0\u201cI\u2019m going to utilise it now to speak with you telepathically. If you can\u2019t quite hear, try pressing the gemstone up against your skin.\u201dWith that, Naoki shuts her mouth, maintains eye contact, and makes her voice heard directly through the telepathic connection. \u201cTesting. Testing. Hello. I realize that this may be a bit strange if you\u2019ve never utilised any sort of telepathy before, but it\u2019s not as difficult as all that once you get the hang of it; the enchantment does most of the heavy lifting.

It\u2019s such an immensely useful ability, beyond my words to quantify. We wouldn\u2019t be in the position we are today if not for these gems, and the immeasurable advantage they confer. You should take some of your spare time, to practice using yours, perhaps have some pleasant chat with Cecil.\u201dNot intending to overload Leona with prolonged mental communication, Naoki switches back to speaking traditionally through the orb.\u201cAnyway, that finalises your employment. Welcome to The Midnight Sun, Leona. I intend to shake your hand when we meet properly. Your first round of pay will come this upcoming Friday, and I\u2019ll arrange a room for you on the second floor sometime before tomorrow night. That leaves me with just two more questions, I believe. First, is there anything that you need? To expect you to do your job properly, it\u2019s my job to make sure you\u2019re outfitted and armed appropriately. Secondly, when would you like to start? I have a task here that should be to your liking, and you could depart tomorrow morning.

And she definitely agreed with the fact, that it would be incredibly convenient, once she got used to it. Talking to others just by thinking words at them? Amazing! She could stay in her bed all day and order food from Skarlet or Cecil. That would be good practice, right?\"Oh, thank you so much! I am really excited.\" she said. Wow, she was getting paid already?

In Gauldin specifically, I have a sufficient number of informers and allies, but as far as the rest of the world is concerned, I\u2019m essentially blind, save for what rumors drift about downstairs. I\u2019d like information relating to essentially all aspects of other nations and regions, and their inhabitants.

Here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. You\u2019re going to make for me a list of everything that you need to travel the world.

Whatever supplies you might need that would be pertinent, make a list, and I\u2019ll have them provided. I\u2019m also going to give you an assortment of magical communication devices and scrying foci, and you\u2019ll carry those with you. Then, whenever you\u2019re prepared to depart, you will do so, and head to some far off part of the world that I haven\u2019t got enough information about. Once you\u2019re there, you\u2019re going to use the equipment I\u2019ve given you to make regular reports back here, and tell us all about it.

That\u2019ll probably mean gold, in more cases than not. Enough to support your travel-related expenses and some more on top of that as your salary. I\u2019ll send that, and replacements for any supplies that you might need replaced. New boots if you wear yours out, or what-have-you.\u201d\u201cFor as long as you continue to supply information I don\u2019t have, I will continue to supply you. Whatever you choose to do with your time beyond gathering and reporting information is yours to spend as you wish, just as so long as it doesn\u2019t get in the way of your job for me. If all of that sounds agreeable to you, there should be some forms and writing supplies in the cabinet to your right. You\u2019ll need to fill out your portions of those, so if you'd be so kind as to bring one of each over here, I'll guide you through filling them out.

After a short meditation she was able to re-center herself and actually felt ready to face whatever meeting would finish out her day. Standing in front of the suite's large mirror, she settled the straps of her pack, quiver, and longbow about her lithe frame, her leathers looking much better after a vigorous brushing out. Finally she pulled most of her thick dark hair into a high tail; multiple earrings glinted from her ears as the Elf arranged the remaining locks about her face. Thus prepared, Indil slipped out of her suite and pocketed the room key after locking the door behind her. Cecil had given her directions earlier and she made to follow them, despite being in a separate area of the inn from whence they originated. After a few moment's casual roaming, the Elf heard the sounds of the casino beyond the stairwell at the end of the hall. Before her were several doors, the closest slightly ajar. Presuming that the prior interview had completed during her respite, the Elf pushed the door farther open and entered the room.The comfortable room held fine furniture--shelves, a table with a glass ball, accompanying chairs, etc--but no people.

Though, Naoki supposes, she hasn\u2019t ever quite seen a bad looking elf, persay.\u201cHe-hem.\u201d Naoki clears her throat in an an attempt to get the visitor\u2019s attention before beginning to speak, \u201cHello, Ms; I am Madame Naoki, and you\u2019re presumably here to speak with me. To whom do I owe the pleasure, and what is it that you would like to speak about?\u201dIndil looked down towards the sudden voice, surprised to see the face in the orb but not showing it. She then sat with perfect posture and faced the orb directly, dark eyes quickly examining the other woman's visage as she spoke. Indil inclined her head in polite greeting before responding to the pleasant introduction. Given the orb's probable field of vision, all Madame Naoki would likely be able to see would be Indil's own sharp features and the quiverfull of blue-fletched arrows rising beyond the Elf's shoulder.\"Hail, Madame. I am Indil Elendrili, a Ranger but newly arrived in the Free City after long travel. Cecil, the Innkeeper downstairs, recommended you as a well-informed individual regarding city affairs. As I have not yet found employment within the city, I felt that I should make myself known to you and offer my services.\"Her voice was a soft alto, nearly accented but such a one that is easily placed. As Indil preferred to keep her speech concise, she ended her comment with another nod and awaited Madame Naoki's response.Within the orb, Naoki nods contemplatively, thinking back to the last time she had interviewed and then employed so many people in a row. Though she isn\u2019t quite prone to that sort of superstition, a small part of her hopes that the awful series of events that followed that surge of employment won\u2019t also be replicated. Regardless, she\u2019s happy to have the help, and if Naoki\u2019s first impressions are anything to judge by, this one seems very capable. \u201cPleased to meet you, Ms. Elendrili. You have indeed come to the right person to seek employment within Isra, I am by far the largest- and many would say the best employer in Isra. You seem to quite the level-headed and competent individual, so I\u2019m fairly confident I\u2019ll be able to offer you a position you\u2019ll find suitable. To do that, I would like to ask you about yourself. I\u2019d like to know what field of work you\u2019d be most interested in, and what skills, capabilities, and talents you have.\u201d", "1460675092000": "Apr 14, 2016 4:00:52 GMT -8 Indil Elendrili said:Apr 12, 2016 20:30:34 GMT -8 Empress Naoki said:\u201cPleased to meet you, Ms. Elendrili.

After all, employment couldn't be expected unless she had some valuable skills.\u00a0\"Indeed, Madame Naoki, it is a pleasure to make your acquaintance. I am, as I mentioned, a Ranger. I can track and hunt, have no difficulties with long treks, and I am skilled with the bow. I also have some understanding of wild flora, as well as small magics to aid in the hunt.\" She gave a light shrug. She disliked discussing herself and so did so with expediency more than false modesty. She was stating her skills. Demonstration of her mastery of them would come when put to her use.\"Though I believe my professional skills are what you would require most, honesty requires me to add that I also have genteel talents as well. I can conduct myself with deportment and sing and play some instruments.\" It was at once both obvious and impossible to imagine the stoic Elf dressed and performing like a fine lady. Clearly, however, they were not skills she utilized often.\"What sort of work you might use me for depends on what you require.\" she said with another light shrug. \"If you can use one such as me I would be honored for it.\"The image of Madame Naoki within the orb continues to nod slowly as Indil speaks to her capabilities. The faint tracings of a smile play at the corners of her mouth.\u201cYou know, Ms. Elendrili, you make a good impression. I can\u2019t quite articulate why, but you seem very capable. I like you, and will gladly accept your services. To start with, I have one task in mind that should make use of your skills as a Ranger, but after that, let\u2019s reevaluate things and perhaps place you into another position; I\u2019m in need of individuals who can fulfill leadership roles.\u201d\u201cTo formalize your employment, I\u2019m going to have to ask that you fill out some paperwork, and file for Isranian citizenship. All of the relevant documents should be in the cabinet to your right, if you\u2019d be so kind as to retrieve one of each, along with some writing tools, I\u2019ll guide you through filling them out. After those forms are completed, I\u2019d like you to head up to the third floor, to the second door on the right. That is the office of my associate Takhana Veil ; she will guide you through the rest of the initiation process and give you your first assignment.\u201d ", "1460675141000": "Apr 14, 2016 12:19:33 GMT -8 Whir said:Apr 11, 2016 23:04:29 GMT -8 Empress Naoki said:\u201cWell, alright then, there we go. Excellent, that was surprisingly simple. All I\u2019m really looking for is information I don\u2019t have about world events. There\u2019s not really a good way to know what\u2019s happening over in say, Gauldin, besides having someone who is there- or has been there, tell you. In Gauldin specifically, I have a sufficient number of informers and allies, but as far as the rest of the world is concerned, I\u2019m essentially blind, save for what rumors drift about downstairs. I\u2019d like information relating to essentially all aspects of other nations and regions, and their inhabitants. Information about the goings-on in their governments, rumors that circulate, noteworthy locations or events that you happen across, whatever you can find.\u201d\u201cSo! Here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. You\u2019re going to make for me a list of everything that you need to travel the world. I intend to outfit you to the best of my ability up front, because I can afford to. Are your boots old? I\u2019ll buy you new ones, that sort of thing. Whatever supplies you might need that would be pertinent, make a list, and I\u2019ll have them provided. I\u2019m also going to give you an assortment of magical communication devices and scrying foci, and you\u2019ll carry those with you. Then, whenever you\u2019re prepared to depart, you will do so, and head to some far off part of the world that I haven\u2019t got enough information about. Once you\u2019re there, you\u2019re going to use the equipment I\u2019ve given you to make regular reports back here, and tell us all about it. If there\u2019s something that I\u2019d like examined in more detail or investigated further, you\u2019ll make a reasonable effort to do so, but not at risk to yourself.\u201d\u201cEvery month, I\u2019ll send a messenger out to you with a supply of goods that are valuable in the land you\u2019re currently in. That\u2019ll probably mean gold, in more cases than not. Enough to support your travel-related expenses and some more on top of that as your salary. I\u2019ll send that, and replacements for any supplies that you might need replaced. New boots if you wear yours out, or what-have-you.\u201d\u201cFor as long as you continue to supply information I don\u2019t have, I will continue to supply you. Whatever you choose to do with your time beyond gathering and reporting information is yours to spend as you wish, just as so long as it doesn\u2019t get in the way of your job for me. If all of that sounds agreeable to you, there should be some forms and writing supplies in the cabinet to your right. You\u2019ll need to fill out your portions of those, so if you'd be so kind as to bring one of each over here, I'll guide you through filling them out. Though you don\u2019t necessarily need to file for Isranian citizenship- since you're not going to be in the country, I would suggest doing so anyway because that makes doing my taxes simpler.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0Whir hadn't been under another's regulation since he left his father's estate. It might prove annoying to have to answer to someone again... Still, what Naoki was offering was more than he expected or needed. And it sounded like if he wanted out of the agreement, he wouldn't be held to it, he'd just lose her support.\u00a0 \u00a0He got up and found the equipment and paperwork, filling them out with Naoki's instruction. He paused at the form for citizenship. He wasn't sure what that would gain for him. He had been walking unimpeded through these lands so far... But if it came down to it, he could just say that he wasn't a citizen of this world...\u00a0 \u00a0When the papers were in order, he looked back to the crystal ball. \"Any place in particular you'd like me to start?\"\u201cNot particularly, no.

One of my associates is capable of creating enchanted parchment that can be made to be altered from afar. I will ask them to create a large map of the world as we\u2019re aware of it, and leave you to fill in the parts we don\u2019t.

Perhaps a few small gemstones instead for whatever you feel my information is worth. Between that and that enchanted map, I should be good for quite a while!\"\u00a0\u00a0 If Whir had noticed Naoki's ample cleavage, he gave no indication. All the forms he had filled out were somewhat confusing and most of his attention was focused on the words therein to prevent them from swimming around the paper.Hearing his response, Naoki reseats herself.\u201cFair enough, then.

Isra could use more diplomats, especially given the rapid rise of Goraia.\" That, and having a Medanian nobleman, possibly the only one left, would be certain to throw the Goraians off. \"Hold on one second.\"She placed he hand on the small purple gem embedded in her breast plate.\"Empress Naoki  ?

When he straightened, he clasped his hands behind him, and nodded once, firmly. \"A pleasure to make your acquaintance, Madame Naoki.\"As with the previous instances, it takes a moment, and there is some minor distortion, but isn\u2019t long before the angular visage of Madame Naoki makes itself present in the misty depths of the orb. She takes a moment to glance around and identify the individuals gathered around the orb, before breaking into a wide smile and, having already been introduced,  greeting her latest visitors. \u201cAh-hah, Lieutenant Finch, and Lord Seryl, I presume. A pleasure to make your acquaintance, Lord Seryl. I\u2019ll spare you the standard pleasantries, but you have my condolences. If there\u2019s anything I can do, let me know.

As it happens, we\u2019re running a bit short of diplomats at the moment. As Lieutenant Finch mentioned, my position is that of Isra\u2019s Treasurer. I run the Treasury Department, and am responsible for all economical and financial matters within the city. However, as things have turned out, here I am, over in Gauldin, currently in the process of negotiating with their King and courts to establish an alliance with Isra. There aren\u2019t many individuals capable of high level diplomacy in the Isranian government, so anyone who is- including myself, are being enlisted to do so. Things are going very smoothly here, and I expect to return within the week, but this isn\u2019t quite my job. I\u2019m sure that between my recommendation and Isra\u2019s lack of diplomats, you would have no trouble securing a position.\u201dThrough the orb, Madame Naoki fixes Tristan with what may only be described as an appraising gaze.

There is\u2026 another opportunity that I might offer you. One that wouldn\u2019t be directly with the Isranian government, but would offer an arguably superior opportunity to use your skills in the way I think you might like to.

The things I am about to tell you are a matter of the highest national security. Regardless of whether or not you accept my offer, you are not to relate this information to anyone.

I don\u2019t mean to threaten you unnecessarily, or imply I that doubt your trustworthiness, but you will regret it if you share this information.\u201dShe pauses for a moment to let that last statement sink in, her most serious expression in place.\u201cWith that said, I\u2019ll proceed.

To summarize, its mission statement is to maintain world peace, either by diplomacy or force, You probably saw their headquarters on the way in. The large, black tower off in the plains. As it so happens, and this is the secret part, I am the ultimate authority of The Black Tower. However, as it would probably be rather suspicious of me to publicly own the largest business in Isra, be Isra\u2019s Treasurer, Ambassador, and lead an international peacekeeping force, I keep that last part under the table. For a while, an associate of mine- she went by the name \u2018Grandma\u2019, ran the day to day matters of The Black Tower.

You fancy yourself a leader and a diplomat. If you pick up some tactical knowledge, or find a general to do so in your stead, and have a mind for intrigue, I think that you may be a reasonable fit for this job. To lead The Black Tower. From atop it, you would have a considerable amount of influence to levy on international politics and events.

Unarmored and without a rider a griffin can fly for nearly 300 miles, although they seldom do, as they will stop several times to eat. A fully armored griffin with a similarly armored rider can go on average 150 miles, and I believe the record is 202 miles or so. A properly cared for griffin will eat at least a full-size cow every few days, either in one sitting or spread out, depending on the preference of the griffin.

I do not require any funds or supplies, the recent military acquisition reforms have pretty much put an end to that. If you have a task needing to be done ma'am, I am the woman to do it.

I'm looking into the possibility of griffin operations over open water- the ocean. Stationing griffins semi-permanently on seafaring or airborne vessels, as opposed to the land-based... bases you use today.\u00a0The unparalleled mobility and tactical versatility offered by skilled griffin riders such as yourself, in the context of what is usually simply ship-to-ship conflict would be an immense asset to have, if I can make it logistically viable to do so, even if only for temporary periods.\"\"With that in mind, let me ask this question. Can griffins fish, or swim? I mean, I would assume not, but your experiences with griffins far outpace my knowledge. Further, if griffins were provided with fish, would they eat it? Is salt-water fish an acceptable substitute for beef, do you think?

", "1461724149000": "Still sorting through paperwork on her end, Naoki again addresses Trisitian. \u201cHave a seat, Lord Seryl. There\u2019s a lot we need to discuss, related to your appointment, responsibilities and all of the intricacies of the job you\u2019re about to accept.

Though she moves with the same curtness and elegance of movement as is standard, the faraway glaze on her eyes and the way her grip on the doorknob trembles attests to the freshly imparted weight on her shoulders; the weight of a nation. Almost mechanical footsteps take Naoki up, from the first floor to the second, and from the second to the third. At last, her walk from The Citadel back to her office is complete, and she collapses into her adjective chair, trusting Artemis to close the door behind them. For a few long moments, she simply sits, chin in hand, eyes focused on the left wall, and upon the map of Isra that adorns it. Over the course of the next week or so, responsibility for this entire city, this entire nation, will come to rest quite squarely on her shoulders. Not quite her shoulders alone, she supposes. There is Tyrus. Much of the administrative work will be his responsibility, especially the majority of the most boorish and mundane maintenance tasks. However, that leaves to her the most important decisions- the incumbency to act decisively, in the best manner in the interest of the people of Isra, as Lady of The Free City. It is at once both an empowering and terrifying prospect to consider. In the election of the last few hours, she was chosen to become arguably one of the highest authorities in the known world. Following the inauguration, she will stand on truly equal footing with the likes of King Renaux of Trav\u00e9re   and that Lord\u00a0Zephidel  character. Her word will be law in Isra; quite literally, as opposed to the de-facto ways of yesterday. Decisions of international policy and appointment of government officials will be hers to make. As the seconds tick past and the metaphorical gears of her mind continue to turn, responsibility after responsibility becomes apparent, and the list of changes to be made and tasks to accomplishes grows longer and longer, to speak nothing of her higher obligation to Kate, and the juggling act that will become necessary to balance all of these matters- public and private, now all with the highest levels of importance. To think! Ildesias is in his three-hundreds, with thirty times the amount of life experiences and leadership practice under his belt, and yet this job broke him. As the pangs of regret begin to sink in, his words echo through her mind.. Apr 29, 2016 9:43:51 GMT -8 Ildesias Xen Torsal said:\"Congratulations on your appointment, Madame. I trust you will find that I did not leave you with a room of unfinished paperwork; which is exactly why I retired. Being able to sleep once again at night will be... Nice, though I fear I will never be rid of the smell of parchment. Do not worry though, as I believe you will be different in the way you approach these things. I admit, I have never had time for personal relationships, or friends, or people I can count on - for many years now I have been acting alone in nearly all things, for I never truly felt I had a trustworthy individual to turn to ask for aid. Thus, I took a burden on my shoulders far too heavy for most - a burden I expect you will not have to take yourself. You seem to have many such individuals in your business and personal life, many such relationships to call on. I expect you will be able to delegate much better than I.\"Unfolding and leaning back, she shifts her gaze first to Artemis, as she stands- locking the door, and then up to the ceiling. Ildesias made a good point, though she didn\u2019t realize the fullness of it at the time. Already, ideas surface regarding which of her associates would be best suited for positions of power in the government, and she admittedly does have a solid handful of trustworthy individuals in the government already, in Elizabeth Finch   and Cyronin the Blue  , and plenty more, such as Jun of the Celadine   and Takhana Veil ,  just to name two, who would doubtless be of unparalleled assistance, no matter their post, and to say nothing of Artemis  .Hands folded in her lap, a deep and rolling sigh passes Naoki\u2019s lips. A new chapter in her life, she supposes. Wrought with an entirely new set of challenges and problems to solve. This time- however, she came prepared. If not fully prepared for the trials, mental, physical, philosophical and ethical that will doubtless face her in the coming years, she is at least somewhat more prepared than she was at the start of the last chapter, with only a single companion and a book. And, regardless, the die has already been cast. There really is no alternative course of action, other than to continue proceeding as she has been- by evaluating circumstances rationally, and choosing and acting upon the best course of action.", "1462048056000": "\u201cI\u2026 I don\u2019t know.\u201dThere are a few more moments of silent contemplation before Madame Naoki begins to speak again. \u201cPart of it was a spur of the moment decision. I wasn\u2019t expecting the opportunity- nobody quite expected Ildesias to resign so soon. But then he did, and the opportunity presented itself. In the space of five minutes, I had to choose. If I would sit or stand; if I would run for the position or not. \u2026 And some small part of me, it said \u201cWhy the hell not.\u201d There was the opportunity to continue moving upward in quite possibly the only way I could, staring me in the face. If I didn\u2019t take it, it probably wouldn't have come about again peacefully.\u201d\u201cI wasn\u2019t quite without rational consideration in those few minutes, though. There were a few specious notions of serving the greater good. Improving the world. Doing the right thing. That sort of\u2026 high and mighty \u201cmoral\u201d nonsense. I would be able to- I am able to enact my will on this world, this nation, in a greater capacity than ever before, and in greater capacity than any other being in Isra, and that\u2019s an empowering feeling to have.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not quite sure why I\u2019m so fixated on this concept of my capability to change things, though. It would be easier to justify my actions with some basic, oneliner sin. Greed for wealth or lust for power, envy for those who carry more authority, or any of those similar reasons. All perfectly valid justifications, if one considers the concept of justification itself to be valid.\u201d\u201cIt would also have been easier to simply retire. We could have afforded to retire comfortably two years ago. It would doubtless be far easier and less taxing for the three of us to simply retreat up to the Chalet and live out the rest of our lives with no obligations other than to each other. I\u2019m not sure why exactly I haven\u2019t decided to do that yet, either.\u201d\u201cPerhaps I\u2019ve been spending too much time with Jun and Lum. Perhaps their righteous \"moral code\" has infected me. Maybe I want to improve things for the better simply because it would be the \u2018right\u2019 thing to do. Yet, I still hold a deep seated disagreement for that method of thinking, and that\u2019s not at all how I consider it, even internally. Morals are still a construction of man; I am still an amoralist.\u201d\u201cBut is it not the duty of the state to provide an environment in which individuals can not only live, but live well? Is it not, as she said, the obligation of those who are already happy and able to do so, to be compassionate and assist others in finding their own happiness?\u201d\u201cNo. It\u2019s really not, not at all. Obligation is a concept that only functions in a legal context. There is nothing truly compelling me to serve Isra other than my own inclination to do so. And that\u2019s the extent of it, I suppose. Though my justifications are specious and ultimately fallacious, I think that I\u2019ve decided that it\u2019s what I\u2019d like to do. For my own selfish reasons of desiring the sort of satisfaction that comes with seeing a job well done, and to see others benefit from my leadership. I have proven- I think, my ability to act in an administrative capacity. I would like to take this step up- to a position of true authority, and utilize my capabilities to enable those who are not happy to become so, and create a truly enviable nation. One that not only protects its citizens and allows them to live in civilised society, but the opportunity to live well, and be satisfied with their lot in life. Not because I think it the \u201cright\u201d thing to do, or because I have any obligations whatsoever, besides those I have chosen to take to a few individuals, but rather because I have chosen to place personal subjective value upon it.\u201dAs the implications of her statement begin to sink in, her contemplative pout gives way to a  small smile, and Naoki begins to chuckle. \u201cI suppose what I said initially was more correct than I realized. I really am just doing all this simply for the hell of it, aren\u2019t I.\u201d ", "1462075331000": "\u201cWe sure do, don\u2019t we.\u201dAs Artemis sets in with the massage, Naoki leans forward onto the desk resting her head sideways on folded arms. For a handful of moments, she sits silently, eyes shut- not contemplating anything at all, simply enjoying the simple situation. It would likely be the simplest and most unconstrained situation for the remainder of the day, at least. Best to savor it. However, Naoki\u2019s ability to not endlessly contemplate and formulate strategies is quite limited. Presently, she begins to speak softly, articulating her plans. \u201cOne of the first things we\u2019re going to need to do is delegate the management of The Sun here to someone. Calico is the obvious choice- Skarlet isn\u2019t quite ready for that level of responsibility, I don\u2019t think.\u201dMadame Naoki\u2019s earring glows brightly for a few seconds as she issues a summons- Calico Swartz  is to meet her at this office as soon as he\u2019s able. \u201cSecondly, we ought to consider which parts of these existing organizations ought to be integrated into the government, and which parts are to be left officially independent. I think that Cyronin would probably do well in a proper military command position. Indil, too. I\u2019m going to need to speak with her more deeply about the extent of her capabilities, when she gets back; she may be suited for the delicate dance of diplomacy. Alden may be able to remain as he is- officially unaffiliated. Or\u2026 Actually. Perhaps if Takhana or Reese were to lead a new department- a clandestine\u2026 intelligence and operations sort of thing. Alden could be part of that, perhaps\u2026 And some consideration should be given to Elizabeth. She has been nothing if not loyal, and now that I have the means to elevate her position\u2026\u201dNaoki continues to muse regarding her reformation plans for Isra, eventually getting a rough plan in order. Enough to begin acting upon, at least. Perhaps too much. Perhaps too ambitious, perhaps too drastic a reform. But she would be damned if she wasn\u2019t going to try. With a renewed sense of determination and some new- undescribable change in character, Naoki stands. If one were to dramatise it, they would say, \u201cNo longer simply a businesswoman. No longer simply a mysterious figure, driving things from behind the curtain, nor a Treasurer, Naoki stands now with the composure befitting the Lady of Isra.\u201dRegardless of how she\u2019s standing, however, there\u2019s work to be done, and dinner to be attended. Before either of those things, though, there\u2019s a more important matter to attend to. Turning to face Artemis, Naoki extends her arms, steps forward, and wraps the other woman in an embrace. No words are said, as none are required between them. After another handful of heartfelt moments, they part, and after another deep sigh, Naoki excuses herself back into her room. She would need to change to attend dinner. ", "1462122362000": "A few moments later, as announced, Madame Naoki emerges from her room, having changed into the same red dress she had worn when meeting Jun for the evening\u2019s planned festivities. \u201cCalico. Good to see you.\u201dGliding over to her chair, Naoki seats herself and takes a quill from her drawer as she begins to address Calico. \u201cYou are in the presence of the newly elected Lady of Isra. Over the course of the last few hours, Ildesias resigned, and I was elected. Congratulations aside, you\u2019re going to assist me. Considering my new obligations to the state, I will no longer have the time to manage The Sun and Eclipse. As such, and assuming that you are willing to accept, I will be handing off management of both enterprises to you.\u201dHaving selected a quill and parchment, Madame Naoki begins to draft a relatively simple document, outlining the terms of the agreement. As opposed to transferring ownership, or modifying all existing documents to cite Calico instead of Naoki, this document establishes Calico as a procurator; a legal representative of Naoki as far as the business affairs of the two businesses are concerned. \u201cI realize that you don\u2019t quite have some of the skills and experience I might prefer that you have, to accept such a position, but to be honest, you\u2019re the best option I have at the moment. I think you\u2019ll be able to pick it up relatively quickly, anyway. With that said, will you accept this responsibility?\u201dShe pauses in her writing to shift her eyes upward, fixing Calico with an unreadable look.", "1462173420000": "\u201cUnfortunately, the only list I have is a mental one. There are so many tasks that need doing, with varying degrees of regularity and involvement, that to compose an exhaustive list when none was necessary would be an exercise in futility. Regardless, I\u2019ll have one made for you in the fullness of time. For the time being, your responsibilities will involve the literal management of the personnel, signing for shipments of ingredients, and generally facilitating things from a position of authority. Skarlet is in charge of managing the wait staff and the operational matters downstairs, so simply make sure that she has what she needs. If anyone comes looking for me, direct them to The Citadel. Additionally, I suggest setting up in the office suite to the left of this one. There are too many things in here for me to move out with any degree of expediency, and you need to start to work essentially immediately. I\u2019ll have the documents that would be relevant to your management moved over in the next few days, along with a full list of the things I expect you to do.\u201dTaking the completed form in hand, and pausing for a moment to examine it and verify its credibility, she tucks it away into one of the drawers on her desk. Next, she raises her left hand, displaying her palm to Calico. The silver signet ring bearing the symbol of The Midnight Sun. A constant accessory of hers for the past four years. With the signing of that contract, now essentially unfit for her hand. Technically, she still owns the whole shebang, and would be very well justified in wearing the ring. However, the purpose of the ring is to identify the acting leader. Which is no longer her, as strange as that is to think. After a moment more of wistful contemplation, she slides the ring off and places it in place of the contract before Calico on the table. A light crease is visible on her finger where the ring once sat, which she rubs at absently. Her new ring would have to be made slightly larger, she muses. With that ceremony complete, Madame Naoki stands, and addresses Calico once again. \u201cHowever, for the time being, I must depart. I have a dinner to attend, and there\u2019s apparently a woman bleeding profusely on the carpet downstairs. We\u2019ll be in touch, and I\u2019ll inform you more specifically of your duties over the next short while. Until we speak again.\u201dAfter nodding solemnly, Naoki bends down to pick up her bag sitting on the floor to the side of her desk, and makes for the exit, pausing for a moment to futilely attempt to pat the feathers on the top of Calico\u2019s head back into place. Leaving him to his state of perpetual-ruffledness, she departs with Artemis in tow, leaving the door open behind her. Her paces take her down the stairs, once, twice, down to the primary eating hall, and toward the area near the door where Whir and his injured companion are beginning to gather a crowd. A low \"he-hem\"\u00a0clears a path through the crowd, and Madame Naoki approaches the group gathered near the door. Though she had been expecting to find an injured woman, the severity of her injuries seem to be greater than Naoki was expecting. However, she wastes no time in horrification, instead approaching more closely, and bending down at the knee in a position somewhat near to the unconscious woman\u2019s head. She gives Whir a moment of her attention before looking to assess the injuries. Lots of bleeding, that\u2019s for sure. But none of the gashes seem to have penetrated to anything vital. Superficial wounds are easy to fix, she muses, reaching a hand into the pouch on her hip. Pulling out a pair of rubies, she hands them off to Artemis. Artemis is more adept in the ways of channeling their magic, and in situations such as these where it doesn\u2019t particularly matter, it would be preferable to have her do it. She also gives the troll and the sword clasped so tightly in the woman\u2019s arms a glance, but only a single, passing one each, judging neither to be immediately relevant to the most pressing matter at hand. Figuring it best to leave the woman\u2019s head undisturbed, and seeing the woman\u2019s hands wrapped tightly around the hilt of the sword, Naoki places two of her fingers on the elf\u2019s inner elbow, and attempts to locate a pulse. As she\u2019s counting mentally, she levies inquisitive glances at both Whir and the troll, expecting someone to explain exactly what\u2019s going on here.", "1462340274000": "Madame Naoki watches carefully as Whir explains the situation more fully, the troll introduces themselves, and begins to tend to the woman. Regardless of Naoki\u2019s personal impressions, they seem to do a reasonable job of healing the elf\u2019s injuries, and indeed, restoring the elf to consciousness. She accepts the gems from Artemis, and slips them back into her pouch, before standing, taking a step back to give the elf some space. Even though she\u2019s clutching a massive sword, the woman seems pleasant and civilized enough, which is always a bonus. \u201cWelcome back to the land of the living, Miss. I\u2019m not quite sure about any wizards, but you\u2019re currently sitting inside The Midnight Sun, Isra\u2019s preeminent eatery, gambling house, and inn. I am Madame Naoki, owner of this establishment, and newly elected Lady of this fine city. This is my companion, Artemis, my associate, Whir, and Ms\u2026\u201d Naoki pauses for a moment to recall the annunciation, \u201cMs. Ranijarashi. Who is evidently a healer of some sort. You were injured rather severely before she tended to your wounds.\u201dWith a sharp shake of her tail, Naoki instructs the rapidly forming crowd to disperse. Whatever this woman is going though, it wouldn\u2019t be helped any by a bunch of gawkers. The crowd generally obeys, having learned to respect the authority of The Tail. Taking Whir\u2019s suggestion, Naoki inclines her head in the direction of the double doors leading to the inn. \u201cPerhaps you\u2019d like to move somewhere more\u2026 quiet to recover. The inn is that way.\u201d", "1462435168000": "Madame Naoki listens carefully as the elf continues to speak. Evidently a relatively cultured sort, or at least someone who can speak well. In combination with that sword- which the elf presumably has some level of skill with, whoever this is, they\u2019re someone of significant note. Somewhere, at least. After taking a moment to think, Naoki responds to the query. \u201cI don\u2019t believe I\u2019ve ever heard of a location named Caasreilan, or any city that is known as \u2018Golden\u2019. I suspect you may be farther from your land of origin than is\u2026 preferable. Let\u2019s move out of this noise, though.\u201dWith a beckoning movement, Naoki attempts to lead the assembled persons out of the Sun\u2019s entryway and over through the double doors of the Inn, and into one of the more spacious vacant suites. The accommodations are as they tend to be, of significant quality and though perhaps a bit worn, not unclean, but cozy. Naoki assumes a position standing in one corner of the room, and as she waits for the rest of the group to enter, mentally sends for some refreshments and a copy of a world map.", "1462502977000": "Madame Naoki waves a hand dismissively. \u201cNo apologies are necessary; you\u2019ve been nothing but courteous, and one can\u2019t be expected to practice flawless etiquette in such circumstances as yours. I can only imagine how disorienting this all must be for you. Regardless, it\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Lady Untyrid. I\u2019m afraid that what Whir said is quite correct; this is the first I\u2019ve heard of any of the names you\u2019re mentioning, and my knowledge of the world as it is known here borders on the encyclopedic. It would seem that you\u2019re awfully far from your home; I\u2019m mildly surprised we\u2019re speaking the same language.\u201d\u201cRegardless, allow me to formally welcome you to the City-State of Isra. As stated, I am Madame Naoki, and as of a few hours ago, I lead this nation. I would like to speak with you at a greater length later, and assist you in either attempting to return to your lands or find a place here, but regrettably, I\u2019m late for dinner. I was invited to dinner by one of my associates in the government, and it would be rather rude to keep him waiting any longer. Whir- if you would be so kind, and if you haven\u2019t got anything better to do, would you stick around for a while and assist Lady Untyrid here in getting acquainted with things and ensure that she doesn\u2019t encounter any further difficulties? I\u2019ve sent for food, drink, and maps, but if you could hang around and see to her needs- conversational or otherwise until I return, I\u2019m sure we would both be grateful.\u201d\u201cWith that said, I must depart. I should return in a few hours. Until then.\u201d Madame Naoki nods to both Whir and Emahra in turn, and lingers in the doorway to see if either of them have anything further to say.", "1463277624000": "A handful of moments following Takhana\u2019s knocking, the door swings inward. Whether the delay is to be attributed to the lengthy process of undoing the door\u2019s many locks, Naoki rising from her bed (her hair does seem slightly off), or some other cause is left for Takhana to guess. Regardless, the door opens! And Madame Naoki can be seen, standing there in the doorway, dressed in only a loose white blouse, and a simple set of black trousers. Behind her, the desk is, (somehow) stacked even higher than is standard with piles of documents. An educated guesser may presume that Naoki is in the process of transferring paperwork related to running The Midnight Sun to Calico\u2019s office. And they would be correct. Takhana is greeted with a weak wave and a genuine smile. A pair of thimbles are visible on her index finger and thumb- presumably to prevent paper cuts. Upon realizing she\u2019s still wearing them, Naoki uses her other hand to remove them and slides them into her left pocket. \u201cTakhana. Good to see you, come in. I assume Alden Marshal is on his way.\u201dStepping back from the door, Naoki gestures to her right- Takhana\u2019s left, toward the sitting room. The door remains open, allowing the candle-lit interior to be visible from the door. The sofas remain pushed back against the walls, and four pillows sit at the cardinal directions of the low table. One would be safe in assuming that the ornate table is where Naoki intends to suggest they dine, seeing as how the desk is both covered in paperwork and also a desk.", "1463290838000": "Madame Naoki nods in response to Takhana\u2019s inquiry, and begins to answer it as she follows her into the sitting room. \u201cThank you, and yes. I apologize, but I was unable to completely separate this otherwise purely personal meal from business. I intend to discuss how the two of you and your fellow operatives will fit into things as the times change, here. In hindsight, I should have warned you, but that was only about a half hour ago when I realized and extended the invitation to Alden. Seems like you came prepared, though\u2026\u201dAs Tahkana proceeds to bring out the table settings from her basket and place the first course on the table, Naoki seats herself on a short pile of pillows on the opposite side of the table, placing Artemis to her right, Alden to her left, and Takhana directly across the table. An eyebrow is raised in the direction of the bisque. A few sniffs identify it as a seafood of some sort. Some manner of shellfish, perhaps. Though she doesn\u2019t wrinkle her nose or visibly display her distaste, there is a touch of trepidation as she takes her spoon, dips it in her bowl, and raises the filled spoon to her lips. Knowing that the easiest way to swallow a distasteful substance is to do so as quickly as possible, without running it over one\u2019s tongue, that is exactly what Naoki does- in a decidedly casual manner, considering. Even so, some of the soup\u2019s flavor finds its way onto her tongue\u2026 and surprisingly enough, it\u2019s\u2026 not that bad. She supposes that it\u2019s probably somewhat irrational of her to base a distaste of an entire grouping of food on a singular horrible experience, but she\u2019s entitled to a few irrational prejudices, is she not? At least this one is harmless, she muses. Regardless, she washes the soup down with a few sips of the provided wine, and nods thoughtfully. Hopefully Takhana wouldn\u2019t ask directly about how she finds the food. She looks to Alden, to see how he responds to Takhana\u2019s inquires. She had gone ahead and taken both of the obvious conversation topics relating to Alden, so until it comes time to ask Takhana questions, Naoki has little to do but sit and listen.", "1463296436000": "As Alden mentions his children, and her namesake, a biting pang of guilt lodges itself in Naoki\u2019s side. She was named as the godfather of those children, and the one of them is named after her. And yet, she hadn\u2019t been present in the days following their birth, and has yet to visit them at all. As busy as she may be, it\u2019s plainly disrespectful on her part, and she knows it. Though she has only seen the children through her metaphorical mind\u2019s eye of scrying, and wouldn\u2019t be able to tell one from another, or pick her namesake out of the bunch, the mental image of some little blue-eared cat-baby gnawing on Alden\u2019s ear brings a genuine smile to her face, and she chuckles slightly at the thought. However, she doesn\u2019t comment further on the topic, and silently resolves to pay Riverside Drive in the near future. As Naoki stomachs another spoonful of soup, she notes Takhana\u2019s choice of words. \u201cCompanion,\u201d in only a week, too! That was going to be Naoki\u2019s next inquiry, but it seems as if Takhana was happy to answer it without prompting. With a slight smirk, Naoki thinks back to when she externally referred to Kate as a \u2018companion.\u2019 Unconsciously, she wishes the same fortune on Takhana, the same quality of relationship. She unconsciously doubt that such a thing is possible, but still. Regardless, Takhana does her the favor of transitioning directly into the singular business matter on the metaphorical table for tonight. Naoki had intended to lob a few questions in Takhana\u2019s direction, but this works too, she supposes. Placing her spoon down to the side of her bowl, and somewhat thankful the opportunity to do so, she knits her fingers together, places her elbows on the table, and rests her chin on hands as she begins to speak. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be rude of you to inquire, no. I don\u2019t much care for it when people unnecessarily delay the primary matter at hand with small talk. Better to handle the big things up front, and let the conversation wind down with pleasantries. That said, figure this.Previously, you here, as Midnight Sun Operatives, your job description was to further my agendas. Almost literally so, on the contracts.  I am Lady of Isra now. Head of state. Yet, I still require individuals like you, Alden, to do the sort of thing you do best. As well as people like you, Takhana, do the the whole information management and scrying bit. Isra lacks a department to handle those sorts of things, so I\u2019m creating one. I\u2019m not sure what it will be called, or any of the specifics regarding its formation or how it will appear in the public eye, but it will be a legal functional equivalent to what you do here, as Midnight Sun Operatives. As the two primary individuals who I would like to not only join this new department, but also play leadership roles within, I would like to have both of your thoughts on the matter, now, in the conceptual stage, before I go about implementing things.\u201d With that said, Naoki reaches for her wine, and has another sip as she awaits a response. ", "1463377850000": "Madame Naoki nods as the two of them voice their replies. \u201cExcellent. That was as easy as I expected it to be. The two of you are excellent, I\u2019m pleased that I have the pair of you on hand to do this sort of thing.\u201dAs the next course is placed before her, Naoki surveys it with a less critical eye. A sort of chicken with mixed vegetables and rice. Excellent. Nothing that used to swim. \u201cThe Sun Marshals sounds fine for a name. Suitably authoritative without seeming presumptuous, and vague enough to reasonably encompass the full purview of our activities. As for the location, I already have a lot of land in mind, and orders placed for some of the materials. I\u2019ll hand off construction to you, Takhana, so you can properly see to it that the building has all that it ought to. You\u2019ve spoken with Ruben before, I assume, so just get in touch with him- I\u2019ve already told him you\u2019re going to take over.\u201dHere, Naoki pauses, and spends a few moments simply consuming her meal. She nods once more, in a decidedly more appreciative manner, and vocalizes her thoughts on the matter. \u201cThis is very good, Takhana. If, for whatever reason this whole Sun Marshal bit doesn\u2019t pan out, I would think that you wouldn\u2019t have much trouble securing another job as a chef. If I might be so bold as to ask, do you attribute your proficiency to anything in particular, or do you think that your Sight conveys an advantage of any sort as far as culinary ability goes?\u201d", "1463387961000": "As Naoki continues to chew on her meal, an appreciative hum of acknowledgement is heard. Only after she finishes chewing, swallowing, and wiping her mouth with a napkin does she respond. \u201cWell, you\u2019re quite good at it, as far as I\u2019m concerned. And I eat Maelik\u2019s cooking on a daily basis. I\u2019ll have to find some excuse to convince you into cooking a meal again.\u201dFor a moment more, Naoki simply eats, considering where to next lead the conversation. It wouldn\u2019t be ideal to return to business matters, it\u2019s bad form to talk about one\u2019s self without prompting, and it would seem- based on both this most recent response and how Takhana has chosen to behave in the past, she feels uncomfortable speaking about herself. That somewhat narrows the breadth of conversational options available to her. A moment more of thinking, and she has it. \u201cOh. Ahah. Here\u2019s a question, a question for each of you. As we\u2019ve already established, I\u2019ve just been elected to lead Isra. I now possess peerless power to change the city however I see fit. How would each of you, personally, like to see Isra changed, in a general sort of sense? Policies to implement, public facilities to construct, changes to existing laws, or some relatively trivial modification that would mean the world to you? There\u2019s undeniably room to improve, and I would like to know what matters to the people, and the group of you are as fair a place to start as any.\u201d", "1463445877000": "\u201cMmm, you make a good point, Alden. I\u2019ll be sure to relay that command to the new Judiciary Ryden Greyiron. He\u2019s a very driven sort, you should get acquainted with him if you ever have the opportunity. Perhaps you, as something of an infiltration artist, could assist him in closing some of the less obvious holes in Isra\u2019s security, as it were. I\u2019m sure I\u2019d feel a bit safer if even you were unable to enter Isra without attracting attention.\u201dMadame Naoki finishes off the remainder of her vegetables as Takhana voices her idea regarding a library. Another thoughtful hum, and again, Naoki wipes her face before responding. \u201cThat\u2019s an excellent idea. I remember- years ago at this point, when I was attempting to procure books, I had to do it from the bazaar, and purchase each book I wanted to read. I\u2019ve managed to accrue quite the collection, and it\u2019s handy to have the books\u2026 on hand, as it were, but not everyone can afford such expenditures. Establishing a public library would be an excellent idea. I could probably name it after someone important, too. Hm.\u201d\u201cI would be somewhat strained to locate staff, though\u2026 I can\u2019t say that I\u2019m aware of any bookish sorts who aren\u2019t already occupied with more pressing obligations\u2026 I\u2019ll have to look around, I suppose. Find some crotchety academics somewhere, dust them off, put them to work\u2026\u201d\u201cThat\u2019ll be excellent if I can force it to fruition, though. The literacy rate is far too low for my liking, and I am personally a massive proponent of self betterment through literature; I accredit a great deal of my success to reading. With a public library established, everyone will have access to knowledge, and have the opportunity to achieve excellence themselves. For free, even. That\u2019s an excellent idea, Takhana.\u201dFinished stating that, Naoki opts not to lob another question straightaway, instead allowing someone else to bring a matter to the table. ", "1463513993000": "\u201cHm. Alright, excellent. I\u2019m probably going to wait to speak with him in an official capacity until after construction is well underway, but perhaps at the next one of these little dinner-meetings, he be present. Even though you\u2019ve been quite tight-lipped in speaking about him, I would presume that he\u2019s quite the character, by combination of the circumstances that brought him to Isra, how he\u2019s been able to earn the title of \u2018companion\u2019 with you, and simply by virtue of being something of an intellectual. I\u2019ll look forward to meeting him, regardless.\u201dWith that said, Naoki wastes no more time with words, and sets about devouring dessert. Silently, she muses, if it\u2019s so difficult for Takhana to cook, how did she manage to make ice cream? Unless Naoki\u2019s culinary knowledge is completely off-track, ice cream is a fairly involved dish to make. As is cake. And fudge. Takhana must have been working for hours to create just these relatively small bowls of deliciousness. Or perhaps Zaor helped. Hm. Yes. He probably did, Naoki resolves. Living in the same house and having two functional eyeballs and all that. Regardless, the ensemble tastes excellent. Cake paired with something-not-cake always makes for an interesting juxtaposition of textures. \u201cIs there anything else we\u2019d like to touch on, here? It\u2019s been a little while since we\u2019ve spoken thoroughly, and we have some time, here.\u201d", "1463533402000": "Madame Naoki doesn\u2019t have many parting words for Alden besides a polite farewell, a thanks for the invitation, and the best wishes for the rest of his day. She continues to consume her dessert at a standard pace, and pauses to respond to Takhana\u2019s inquiry. \u201cMm. Fair enough. I don\u2019t think I have any tasks in particular for you\u2026 Not at present. I do have a few questions, though, that you may or may not be able to answer. I apologize, as these are somewhat personal, but are also necessary. First one, how much scrying are you capable of, volumetrically speaking? If I said, purely hypothetically, \u201cObserve and create a record of every action taken within X area\u201d, wherein X is an amount of area in an urban setting, such as a city block in Isra, for example, how large of an area could X be, with you able to feasibly accomplish such a task without running yourself into the ground?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not particularly well versed on the mechanical specifics of scrying, or how you specifically do it, but foresee needing to keep tabs on large areas in the near future. What would you need to do that?\u201d", "1463545722000": "\u201cHmm. So the limiting factor is the size of your focusing crystal, not so much any mental factor. That\u2019s good. I was worried there would be some limiting factor inherent to how much you\u2019re able to focus on at a time. We can get larger crystals easily enough, if you could start looking into that, checking your notes and keeping an eye out for large crystals that might be suitable, we can send someone to obtain them. That\u2019s secondary to establishing the Sun Marshals, of course, but if you find yourself with some free time\u2026 you know. Have a look.\u201dHaving finished with her bowl, Naoki wipes her face, places her spoon in the bowl, and slides it forward slightly to indicate that she is finished, nodding again in Takhana\u2019s direction to indicate her appreciation. However, she does not rise from her cushion, indicating that the discussion isn\u2019t yet complete. \u201cNext question. As I understand, you have \u2018The Gift of Prophecy\u2019, which is, again, as far as I\u2019m aware so far, a sort of future-sight. I\u2019d like to inquire as to its potential uses. I wouldn\u2019t like to push you into using your abilities in ways you wouldn\u2019t prefer to, but I also wouldn\u2019t like to allow such a significant portion of your capabilities to go to waste. If there\u2019s some way in which you think you could be doing good with your gift, I\u2019d like to hear about it, so that I might provide you the ability to use it as such. I\u2019d suggest something myself, but I obviously have no idea how it might be applied. If nothing immediately comes to mind, or if you\u2019d rather not, that\u2019s fine, but you haven\u2019t really made much use of it yet, to my knowledge, so I\u2019d like to offer you the opportunity to.\u201d", "1463549079000": "\u201cHmmh.\u201d\u201cThat must be pretty off-putting, to know, but to not know in that way. I wouldn\u2019t be able to take you to a battlefield and have you advise a general on which moves to make to secure victory, or have you shake hands with someone casually, and inform me as to which actions they would take in the next hour. Fair enough. Even so, if you wouldn\u2019t mind, I would appreciate being kept up to date with any visions you see of any particular consequence. That mist monster, for example. Even though I share almost all of the information I receive with you, having some idea, even just a vague one, as to what may happen would probably be helpful in my administration. At least as far as potential threats to Isra might go.\u201dFor a moment, Naoki simply sits, examining a particular bit of patterning on the table between them. When she speaks, she does so in a softer, yet somehow more serious tone, fixing Takhana with an expression to match. \u201cThat really is quite disturbing. \u2026 Secondary question. Do your visions always come true? Or is it a potential future sort of thing, that can in some cases be altered? I apologize- that\u2019s sort of a very specific question, and you may not know the answer\u2026 but this mist monster has me concerned. Perhaps unrightfully so, but I\u2019m beginning to get that feeling of \u2018suddenly I\u2019m responsible for the lives of thousands\u2019 bit. Things that I would not have thought to be a threat before, because I could personally evade them, and protect those important to me on a scale of tens\u2026 suddenly seem much more serious because Isra has no feet, and Artemis cannot defend the entire city against monstrous mist abominations.\u201d", "1463779715000": "Naoki nods slowly as Takhana provides her explanation. An interesting sort of thing, that. Must be exceptionally strange, to see multiple futures, as opposed to continually reliving the past. And then, having multiple futures, and not being able to tell which one, if any, will come to pass. \u201cAt the risk of repeating myself, fair enough. Thank you.\u201dFor a moment, Naoki simply sits. Contemplating. She could choose to inform Takhana of her own mental\u2026 condition? Ability? The terminology is debatable, she supposes. Or she could choose to get on with her day. After the moment passes, she begins to speak again,\u201cI suppose I should let you go now. Goodness knows we both have enough to do. We\u2019ll be in touch, obviously, and as pleasant as this was, we can\u2019t quite justify spending all day sitting about when we can communicate just as easily telepathically. I enjoyed this thoroughly, your cooking was excellent, and we should do this more often.\u201dWith that said, Naoki rises from her cushion, takes a moment to stretch, and moves to offer her assistance to Takhana with putting the items back into the basket. She presumes that the cutlery and such, not being particularly magical or anything, wouldn\u2019t be terribly visible, and would assist if Takhana would allow her to, but not intrude if Takhana seems to have it under control. Perhaps another day.", "1463802462000": "After all of Takhana\u2019s items are loaded successfully back into her basket, Naoki moves to collect the pillows from the floor, and pauses as Takhana bows, holding a cushion in each hand as she returns the bow with one of her own and responds, \u201cYour assistance has been invaluable. At the risk of showing you in praise, you have been exactly what I\u2019ve needed. You\u2019ve got discretion, administrative capability, and have done brilliantly so far. Thank you. I\u2019m pleased to have your talents in my service as we continue upward, and trust that you will continue to perform excellently in this new position. I\u2019ll speak with you later, have a good day.\u201dFarewells complete, Naoki watches as Takhana departs, and continues to tidy the room. ", "1465157354000": "As the late afternoon begins to transition into the early evening, Madame Naoki enters The Midnight Sun. Something she hasn\u2019t done for quite a while. Following her election, and the resultant handing off of the business to Calico, she hasn\u2019t had much reason to frequent The Sun.  Mostly back and forth between The Citadel and Chalet. Yet, today, she has a good reason. On her escapade to The Land Tillers\u2019 state, Emahra picked up an interesting sort. An admiral, apparently. One who would like to offer his services to Isra. Which, considering Naoki\u2019s aspirations to cultivate an Isran navy, could potentially be quite useful. Which is, of course, assuming that he\u2019s not some self-declared admiral with zero experience. That would remain to be seen. But today they would be meeting. Emahra, her new admiral friend, and apparently some friends of his. Seeing as how Naoki\u2019s office only has the two seats, she figured that the meeting could be held at The Sun. Because why not.As she weaves her way through the ever-present crowds, some of the older employees recognize her and make their greetings. Naoki nods in response, but doesn\u2019t stop for chatting. Chatting must be scheduled. Eventually, she makes her way up to the second floor, to the private dining room. Due to the potentially secretive nature of the conversations they might have, she figures it best to take it upstairs. Flagging down a pair of employees, Naoki issues her instructions. The table for two is to be exchanged for a larger, six person one. More chairs are brought in, and the bowl-of-fancy-rocks centerpiece is exchanged for an assorted floral arrangement. Can\u2019t go wrong with flowers. Not being quite sure how many guests she\u2019ll be hosting, Naoki has the table set for six. Easier and more polite to have table settings taken away than set out for unexpected guests. Additionally, a bowl of appetizer cheese-bread is placed on the table. Can\u2019t go wrong with appetizer cheese-bread, either. Figuring that her guest ought to be arriving shortly enough, and not having anything much else to do until they arrive, Naoki seats herself at the head of the table, and produces a book from her bag. A relatively new, green leather covered tome, bearing no markings on the exterior. Sliding her plate slightly away, she begins to read, patiently waiting for her company to arrive. ", "1465331730000": "Madame Naoki watches as Valerian salutes. Evidently a man who has learned discipline and respect somewhere. Good to see. She inclines her head in response, gestures to the table, and responds, \u201cLikewise. Have a seat.\u201dAfter placing a bookmark in her book, stowing it away, greeting Emahra, and while waiting for the other two guests to seat and situate themselves, she casts a curious eye down the table. It seems as if six was indeed the correct number. Enough to seat each guest and leave the opposite head of the table empty. A motley crew, these. The spear-toting admiral. Well dressed, disciplined, but with some manner of rodent on his shoulder. The uniformed man. Carrying a box of scrolls. An architect, or engineer, perhaps? Covered in medals. Medals signifying what? Hard for Naoki to tell. And then the rippling mass of green muscle. His exploits are much easier to decipher, tattooed over his body as such. Some sort of seafarer, evidently. Fitting, she supposes. Before Naoki has the opportunity to address her assembled guests, a waitress enters the room, and assumes a position off to one side of the table. In her left hand, a few menus are held, prepared to be passed out to any who might wish to take one. In her right, a quill and parchment, presumably for taking orders. \u201cGreetings, everyone. I am Madame Naoki, Lady of Isra. You\u2019re here- presumably, because I would like to invest in a navy to rule all of the seas that are worth ruling, and you\u2019d like to play a part in it, and hopefully have some applicable skills. Before we get to buisness, I suggest that we give Madeline here our orders.\u201dNaoki gestures to the waitress. Madeline, apparently. After spending a moment to think, Naoki addresses her,\u201cI haven\u2019t eaten yet today; I\u2019ll go with the King\u2019s Ransom.\u201dNodding, Madeline makes a note on her parchment, and looks to the rest of the guests, prepared to take orders or distribute menus as necessary. ", "1465463500000": "After notating each of their orders and muttering something affirmative, Madeline moves from the room, presumably down to the kitchen. From her position at the head of the table, Naoki again casts a look down the table. Truly a motley crew. But evidently a varied lot. The Admiral, The Designer, and The Captain. It\u2019s as if all of the primary managerial staff to construct a navy have been dumped into her lap. Assuming that each of them are competent enough to meet her standards in their professed fields, all that remains\u2026 would be to gain an understanding of each of their characters, employ them officially, and issue instructions. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to make all of your acquaintances. I assume, by attending this dinner, that the three of you are willing to consider accepting positions within this navy I plan to form. I\u2019ll be proceeding with that understanding. With that said, however, I would like to offer you each the opportunity to introduce yourselves more fully as we\u2019re waiting, here. I\u2019d like to know a bit more about you each before I start offering jobs, handing out contracts, and constructing plans. I\u2019d like to know about prior experiences, qualifications, skills, all of that. Anything that would be relevant to me in evaluating each of you for potential employment.\u201d With that said, Naoki stops speaking, opening the metaphorical table for any of the three to begin. ", "1465690039000": "Madame Naoki listens, nodding several times in acknowledgement as the men present their credentials. Quite impressive. It would seem to be as if some of the most talented naval minds available have been dropped into her metaphorical lap. Assuming none of them are exaggerating, it should be childishly simple to utilize their skills to accomplish her goals.\u201cImpressive.  What a fortunate meeting this is, then. Here I am, searching for individuals to lead, construct, and operate my navy, and here are the three of you, perfectly suited and willing to do just that. Each of your qualifications are far more than I was willing to settle for, and barring any technical complications, I would like to offer you all positions within Isra\u2019s government.\u201d", "1465717623000": "\u201cExcellent. We\u2019ll work out the specifics of your appointments regarding pay and contracts and all of that later tonight, but I think we\u2019ll be able to come to a fine understanding. I treat my associates well.\u201dA slight inclination of Naoki\u2019s head in Emahra\u2019s direction seems to say \u2018ask her\u2019. \u201cAs for your designs, Stark\u2026 Well, I\u2019ll have a look at them if you\u2019d like, but I don\u2019t know the first thing about shipbuilding. Showing them to me would be about the same as showing them to Valerian\u2019s fuzzy friend over there. Perhaps interesting to look at, but neither he nor I will be able to assess the seaworthiness of the vessel depicted. I\u2019ll give you the benefit of the doubt, but\u2026\u201dNaoki shrugs somewhat dispassionately. \u201cThe fact of the matter is simply such that if you don\u2019t meet my expectations, you will be dismissed and replaced. However, if what you said is the full extent of the truth, you should be able to easily meet and exceed my expectations, and it won\u2019t be an issue. So unless you\u2019d like to captivate my attention with esoteric buoyancy diagrams or whatever else it is you have over there, I have no need to peruse your designs right now, Stark.\u201dTurning to regard Valerian, Naoki awaits his answer.  He would be the most important piece of this puzzle of hers. The keystone to hold the whole metaphorical naval bridge up. His acceptance at this stage is expected, but still rather important. ", "1465802575000": "In response to Valerian\u2019s inquiry, Naoki nods slowly. \u201cI must admit at this point, I\u2019m not at all versed on naval strategy. I would appreciate at a later date if you would reccomend some material for me to review to gain a functional understanding of the art, but for now, I couldn\u2019t tell you with any detail what I\u2019d like, beyond \u201ca navy enough to protect Isran merchants at sea, defend the waters off our west coast, and potentially disrupt enemy naval movements.\u201d What you said seems to be that, so I\u2019ll nod, and smile, and say, \u201cYes. That. Make me that.\u201d\u201dNaoki proceeds to humorously pantomime, grinning widely and nodding vigorously for a moment before slowing, and allowing her grin to devolve into a light chuckle before fading out entirely. ", "1466182491000": "\u201cExcellent. Once you\u2019ve got a plan sorted out, I\u2019d appreciate being informed, but I\u2019ll leave it to you fellows to do the formulation.\u201dAs if on cue, Madeline chooses this moment to return with dinner. Her cart jingles slightly as she wheels it into the room; it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess how she got it up the stairs. With well practiced movement, she begins transferring the covered platters from the cart to their intended recipient. For Naoki, The King\u2019s Ransom. Even though the dish\u2019s creator isn\u2019t present to prepare it personally, the Midnight Sun cooks have learned to craft a reasonable enough facsimile. Naoki\u2019s special order, as it has been ordered a few times before includes having the slab cut lengthwise before serving and foregoes the peas. For Ema, the Katashima special with a tall glass of Silverleaf. Though the nation in reference has since been lost to the sands of time, its legacy lives on in this dish. For Valerian, the Solar Flare and the accompanying drinks; seafood for the seafaring man. Though, traditionally prepared lobsters aren\u2019t nearly as spicy. And another for Stark, identical to the first save for the Dragon\u2019s Roar that is placed to one side. And finally, for Gothmog, a massive steak. As opposed to the reasonably sized ceramics the rest of the meals are served on, this stake of undeclared origin sits directly on a bed of mashed potatoes, which in turn sits directly on the platter it is served on. The spinach is provided separately in a bowl, along with some oversized utensils. After waiting for each member of her table to be served, Naoki raises her mug toward the center of the table in some manner of undeclared toast, and after taking a sip, sets about consuming her meal- still somewhat hungry from not having eaten earlier in the day.  ", "1466249541000": "Naoki\u2019s knife traces lines across the slab of meat before her, separating it cleanly into bite-sized cubes to be individually consumed. As the group forges ahead with conversation, she adopts a primarily observational role. If they\u2019re willing to showcase their characters and speak about themselves without any prompting, she\u2019s perfectly content to simply listen and eat, offering small tidbits here and there where appropriate, and handling queries directed in her direction. Really, a rather strange sort of group, their continued conversation confirms. But one that inspires confidence. Without too much to offer, Naoki simply absorbs, learning a fair bit about naval strategy and her newest subordinates in the process. Eventually, however, Naoki polishes off the final bite of her meal, wiping her mouth and sighing contentedly, decidedly more satisfied than when she sat down. After spending another moment to place her cutlery on her plate, and rest her hands in her lap, she looks up to consider her dining companions. If they\u2019re finished with the meal, she could begin wrapping things up, or if not, there are a few topics of conversation she might choose to bring up. ", "1466640352000": "Noticing that the ball is once again in her court, Naoki once again addresses the whole table. \u201cThank you both. Though I don\u2019t manage things here personally anymore, it\u2019s good to hear that they\u2019ve not been getting complacent in my absence. For what it\u2019s worth, I also enjoyed the meal, and your companies for it. I\u2019ve had worse dining guests\u2026 perhaps I\u2019ll tell that tale sometime. But for now, we\u2019ve all got other matters to attend to. And for the three of you gentlemen, I would think that there are some rooms here in the inn that require your attention. The lodgings here are superior to the ones provided in The Citadel, so I\u2019d suggest that you stay here until more permanent residences can be secured. You\u2019ll not be charged, of course. Tomorrow, whenever your hangovers wear off enough to allow for coherent conversation, come visit The Citadel and we\u2019ll get the paperwork sorted. Then work can begin in earnest on what ought to be the finest navy this world has ever seen.\u201dWith that. Naoki rises, planting one palm flat on the table and raising the other in a fist. Though the sight of Naoki\u2019s clenched fist is something to be sneezed at, her eyes betray some\u2026 something. Some emotion that is difficult to identify. Perhaps determination. Perhaps satisfaction. Perhaps dreams of brutally subjecting  any who dare oppose her with gratuitous naval force. Who can say. Regardless, whatever it is doesn\u2019t remain for long as she relaxes, simply standing at the head of the table. A small motion in Ema\u2019s direction indicates that she is not a component of the three gentlemen, and should remain. ", "1466961868000": "As the door shuts behind the men, Noki nods to herself, but does not sit. Instead, she moves from her chair at the head of the table over to one of the cabinets sitting around the room, stretching as she does so. Bending at the knees, she opens one of the lower doors, and begins to shuffle things about inside, presumably looking for something. Turning her head slightly to one side, she addresses Ema in a decidedly more casual tone, \u201cSo, Emahra. How have you been? Anything you\u2019d like to discuss?\u201dBefore going into the topics she has for discussion, Naoki figures it best to allow Emahra the opportunity to share her thoughts.", "1466976097000": "Naoki nods thoughtfully into the cabinet as Ema relates her frustrations with Cyronin and her enjoyment of Valerian\u2019s company. However, she offers no comments beyond acknowledgement. They had spoken once before, telepathically about Cyronin, and how Naoki thought that Cyronin\u2019s actions were reasonably justified from a practical standpoint, but still quite rude, especially considering the level of respect Emahra ought to be afforded. Naoki has yet to speak with Cyronin, seeing as how he\u2019s still out in the field, doing the whole \u2018lead the army\u2019 thing, but she intends to, and there isn\u2019t much more to say until she does. \u201cDo you really find my company so abhorrent that you would rush me so into giving you your next assignment so you can be rid of my presence?\u201dNaoki chuckles, her inquiry clearly in jest.\u201cI do have an assignment for you, but I\u2019ll get to it when I please. Unless you would really prefer not to- and I won\u2019t force you to, if you\u2019d prefer to go knock a few back with the boy downstairs, but I\u2019d simply like to sit you down and speak with you for a short while. I don\u2019t know you as well as I\u2019d like to.\u201d\u201cYou see, now that my reign is\u2026 reasonably established\u2026 well enough, at least, I\u2019ve begun to turn my thoughts toward the future. The future, more long term strategies, far reaching and permanent plans, and what I would like to happen should something untoward happen to me...\u201dFor one speaking of the concept of their own untimely demise and preparation of successors, Naoki speaks with an apparent lightheartedness, casually meandering her way toward the point that she\u2019d like to get at, taking her time to pause where she sees fit and not taking each step too seriously. \u201cAhah.\u201d Her exclamation signals her success in the cabinet. After a moment more, she extracts the result of her search. It is a box. A wooden box, and a very well made one, at that. Hewn of some dark, slightly reddish wood that very nearly matches the tone of her hair, it has been polished to an impeccable sheen, and reflects light very well. Approaching the table, Naoki carefully sets the box down, and runs one  finger around the upper edge as she continues, pulling out the chair. Naoki slides herself into the seat Valerian recently occupied, to the left of the head of the table, and across from Ema, whom she now establishes eye contact with.\u201cAnd you, Emahra, I think that I would like you to play a role in those sorts of things. But before we get to that, do you know of the game they call \u2018chess\u2019?\u201dAt this, Naoki levels an inquisitive, somewhat mischievous eyebrow across the table, genuinely unsure if Emahra, what with her history and all that, would know of chess. ", "1466988736000": "At Emahra\u2019s admittance of her unfamiliarity, Naoki\u2019s face lights up, evidently somewhat pleased to have the opportunity. \u201cAh, well then, allow me to introduce you!\u201dTurning her gaze to the box, Naoki moves excitedly to unhinge the lid, revealing the contents of the box. It is a chessboard, of a rather audaciously gold and black motif. Carefully removing the board from the box, Naoki sets it on the table between them, and proceeds to unpack the pieces, explaining as she goes. \u201cChess is a game of  strategy and logic played between two individuals using a set, like this one. I received it as a gift from some impudent Gauldish noble who thought he could buy my hand in marriage. He was\u2026 informed otherwise, but I kept the gifts. Turns alternate between the players, and on their turn, each player may choose to move one of their pieces- one set of which, in this case, is the gold, and the other is black. For conversation\u2019s sake, allow me to take the black pieces, and you the gold.\u201d\u201cEach piece- you can see how they\u2019re not all the same, can only move in certain ways across the board. Some are more capable than others. To start with, we have the pawn. Though- I should preface, the whole game, names, movement, and style of the pieces, are all styled very directly after warfare. The pawn, for example, represents a spearman. They are only capable of moving forward. One space at a time, or two spaces if it is the first time that pawn is moving. However, if there is an opposing piece to the forward diagonal, the pawn can move diagonally to capture the piece, like so\u2026\u201dNaoki demonstrates the motion, toppling a gold pawn with her gold. Over the course of the next short while, she proceeds to explain the rules of chess, how each piece moves, the objective of the game, and speaks for a few minutes as to the nuance of the game, and how to play well, one ought to put themselves in the mind of their opponent, and attempt to engineer situations that seem appealing to them, but ultimately result in a favorable trade for you. What she says is mostly correct, and touches upon some rather complex theory, but lacks all personal experience, and comes off more as a scholar reading a dissertation than a master explaining their craft. \u201cAnd\u2026 I must admit. For as much as I know of the game, I\u2019m not a particularly excellent player. I mean to say, understand the game, but\u2026\u201d Naoki shrugs noncommittally. The truth of the matter is that she has never fully applied herself to the game. The extent of her experiences go no farther than a few casual games with Artemis shortly following the acquisition of this jeweled set, (of which she lost all) and a book written about the game, which was read some nine years previously but is remembered as clearly as anything else.\u201cIt\u2019s not a bad way to spend some time with someone, though. And you seem like the sort who might enjoy this manner of game. So, unless you\u2019d prefer not to or have any questions- I may very well have forgotten something important, gold moves first.\u201dResting her elbow on the table and cupping her chin in the palm of her hand, Naoki gestures toward the board, which is now fully prepared, set for their game.", "1466991625000": "\u201cMmm.\u201d Naoki nods thoughtfully, both in response to Ema\u2019s move, and her statement. \u201cThings work\u2026 differently in Gauldin. I\u2019ll not use the word \u2018backwards\u2019 publicly, but I find their system, of their kings and their vassalage and their dukes and heredity transfer of power to be\u2026 inefficient, at best. My preferred principle is meritocracy. He or she who is best suited to the job, barring any complications, ought to have the job, generally speaking. What Gauldin does, with its overly complicated and massively ineffectual system of feudal land ownership and horrid arranged marriages and whatnot\u2026 I simply don\u2019t like it. It leaks into their morals, too, which is even worse. Buying marriages is a very common and socially acceptable practice over there.\u201dThe disgust practically drips off Naoki\u2019s words as she speaks of the practice. Having mulled over her move as she spoke, she simply opts to move her pawn from E7 to E6. \u201cI mean no offense to the people, of course. King Renaux is a fine man, as is his queen, and the country itself is beautiful- you ought to visit sometime\u2026 but I must wonder where they would be with some more logical policies.\u201d ", "1467043868000": "A faint sort of smile traces its way across Naoki\u2019s face. Already, her first gambit has succeeded; Ema has been lead into speaking of her homeland. Ever since their first encounter, Naoki has been very curious to hear of it. The idea that this woman, sitting across from her is from, was raised, and spent the majority of her life in an entirely separate plane of existence- a wholly distinct world, is such a wild and exoitc notion to consider, and one that begs many questions. While it would have been rude to ask directly, leading the conversation in the direction she did, Naoki successfully squeezed out a few tasty tidbits of information, which have now been committed to memory.If Ema is so prone to suggestion in the game as she is in conversation, Naoki muses, this ought to be a trivial victory. Without more than a moment\u2019s more worth of hesitation, Naoki moves her king\u2019s pawn forward to meet Ema\u2019s in the center of the board. \u201cMhm. That seems a fair enough way to do it, to me, a sort of hybrid. Have you considered writing of your homeland? Even if you\u2019d prefer not to share the writings with anyone right now, that seems to me like the sort of thing you ought to make record of sooner rather than later. To look back on later in life when the memories have faded, or perhaps share with your children.\u201dSubtly, Naoki straightens in her seat, rolling her shoulders back to adopt a posture not unlike Valerian\u2019s as she waits to see how her second set of moves will be received. ", "1467160272000": "Watching and listening to Emahra, the corners of Naoki\u2019s mouth tilt downward. Overconfidence. Pushed too hard. But might perhaps result in interesting reading later. Naoki continues to make moves in silence for a short while longer, allowing Ema an appropriate amount of time to ruminate before piping up again, \u201cWell,\u201d she says, reaching to make another move, \u201cyou might find it tiring of me to say this again, but if there\u2019s anything I can do. Say the word.\u201d\u201cHowever. Unless you\u2019d like to dwell on things or discuss them with me, allow me to direct our metaphorical gaze of discussion forward. To the future.\u201d\u201cAs I mentioned, I\u2019ve begun considering successors. Obviously- unless things change between now and then, my successor will be chosen by vote, but that\u2019ll be mostly a formality if I\u2019ve already prepared an ideal candidate. And to be perfectly frank, at this moment in time, you\u2019re foremost among my options. It\u2019s mildly amusing to consider, really. I\u2019ve lived in Isra essentially since its inception. I know it, its people. How it functions, why it is the way it is, and all of the situationally specific data. I\u2019ve learned a lot regarding politicking, and national management over the last few years. Enough to function respectively, with the frequent assistance of my assistants and books. But not nearly as much as you, what with your years of training, most of which I assume remains applicable. Our collective knowledges would form the ideal High Lady.\u201d\u201cHowever, by continuing to expand the spheres of our individual knowledge and skillsets, we can make two mostly ideal High Ladies. So I\u2019d like to propose the following. Note that this a proposal, not an order, and you can decline, and that would be fine.\u201dRemoving her arms from the table, Naoki leans back, folding one arm beneath her chest and using the other to gesticulate as she continues, \u201cAlready, I find myself hard-pressed to be everywhere I need to be, and responsibilities will continue to mount. And, rather than keeping you at my side as an over-qualified aide, it would make more sense, for the both of us, I would think, to develop unique manner of working relationship between the two of us. One extending beyond your simply being a Sun Marshal. One wherein you are more akin to\u2026 to one of my hands. A representative, of the most direct variety. Fully plenipotentiary, operating primarily autonomously. Jus tractatuum, if you will. A relationship wherein you act in my name in situations that you would be better suited to handle, situations that are mortally dangerous, or situations that occur concurrently with some other matter that requires my attention.\u201d\u201cAdditionally, I would hope that you and I would be able to teach each other a thing or two. Increase the knowledge overlap. I don\u2019t\u2026 believe that there\u2019s a word that fully encapsulates what I mean to get at. There may  be. I may have missed it. But I think that I\u2019ve articulated my proposal clearly enough. What are your thoughts?\u201d", "1467173355000": "As Emahra contemplates, Naoki passes the time at first by casually studying her. She reflects on how now two of the most important individuals in her life share her amber-gold eyes. An interesting sort of probably-coincidence, she muses. \u201cExcellent. I have a secondary, follow up proposal. Simpler than the first. Again, it is acceptable to decline.\u201dNaoki pauses, fixing her gaze on the woman sitting across from her. For all the world, it seems as if this second proposal is to be something intensely serious. Very rarely, if ever, does Naoki focus so intently- so obviously, on another. \u201cMay I hug you?\u201d", "1467318107000": "Allowing herself to be tugged to her feet and embraced, Naoki reciprocates the embrace, wrapping her own arm around the slender elf.It occurs to Naoki, at this point, that it must be somewhat strange for two elves to hug. As Naoki understands, elf ears are sensitive in a similar manner to her own. Erogenously so. Their ears would rub together when hugging, assuming the two elves in question are roughly the same height and don\u2019t make an effort to prevent ear-rubbing. It isn\u2019t an issue in this case, considering that Naoki\u2019s ears are on the top of her head, but it must be somewhat awkward.Regardless, for her part, Naoki does well to make the embrace seem platonic. As tempting as it is to start stroking and attempt to escalate things, Emahra probably wouldn\u2019t take kindly to such things. Perhaps later; probably never. Instead, Naoki simply remains for however long Emahra would like to maintain the hug, allowing her to break it off when she decides to. Presumably, she does, at some point. As she does, Naoki holds her for a moment by the shoulders and delivers a firm, friendly nod before disengaging. As she reseats herself, the smile remains, and gains an aspect of satisfaction. This meeting\u2019s goals- primary and secondary, have been accomplished.After waiting for Ema to reseat herself, \u201cThere\u2019s just one more thing. Just now, you said, \u2018If you believe I would be the best person for the position, I will not attempt to dissuade you,\u2019 Naoki\u2019s impersonation is on-point.\u201cDon\u2019t do that. The logic that I use is no better than yours. If you see a flaw with a plan I propose, or have reason to think that a decision I\u2019ve made is incorrect, or could be improved, I would ask you to say so.\u201dWith that said, Naoki turns her gaze downward to the board, and, after a few moment\u2019s worth of deliberation, makes her next move. ", "1467339179000": "At Emahra\u2019s comment about the people accepting her, a wry sort of thought strikes Naoki that she declines to articulate. The informed people of Isra would be better off with an \u2018Elven would-be-queen of a dead people who is not even from this world\u2019 than they would be with a \u2018former slave and bar owner, overly promiscuous amnesiac catgirl\u2019. As Ema continues to point out the state of the game, it\u2019s Naoki\u2019s turn to raise her eyebrows in surprise. \u201cIs it.\u201dTurning her gaze downward, a quick study of the board reveals that\u2026 it is. Most definitely so. In a complete surprise to Naoki, her king has been pincered, pinned against his bishop, unable to move and fated to die- either by the hand of Emahra\u2019s queen or rook. What a way to go, Naoki muses. Still studing the state of the board, Naoki speaks,\u201cGoodness, it is. \u2026 You\u2019re a quick study, aren\u2019t you. Well played.\u201dNodding mostly to herself, Naoki accepts the defeat, but leaves the board as it is while she turns her gaze upward, again to address the woman sitting opposite her. \u201cI found that rather enjoyable, we should play again sometime. What are your impressions of the game?\u201d", "1467395774000": "Listening to Emahra\u2019s impressions, Naoki nods yet again to articulate her acknowledgement and understanding. Such a versatile gesture, the nod. Here, she pairs it with a smile to reciprocate Ema\u2019s jovial sort of friendliness. \u201cI\u2019m pleased to hear that I thought correctly in thinking you might enjoy it, then. I\u2019ll look forward to our next match. However, before we conclude our meeting here, I do have something I\u2019d like you to do, in the context of acting as my proxy, as you put it.\u201dResting her lower arms across the armrests of her chair, Naoki steeples her fingers together above her lap, pausing for just a moment to collect her thought before articulating them, \u201cWhat I\u2019d like you to do is journey up to The Winterlands, Isra\u2019s newest territory. Right know, the extent of my knowledge of the Winterlands is somewhat limited, to say the very least. So I\u2019d like you to visit The Winterlands in my stead and learn everything you can about the lands, their people, House Winter, their ways of life, their towns, their industries, all of it. I want to know what weaknesses and flaws they have. I want to know what they want. The hardships they face.  I want to know how strong of an ally they will be, and, conversely, if they rebel, how much of a pain they will be to quash. I want to know of Lord Crovan as a man and as a leader. His ideologies, how he approaches problems. How his people consider him, and how he considers his people. Who is in position to succeed him if he falls, and what they\u2019re like. I want to know every scrap of possibly useful information you can possibly uncover. What I\u2019d like you to do- essentially, is conduct a thorough investigation without seeming like you\u2019re conducting a thorough investigation, per se.\u201d\u201cDue to the nature of the assignment, you\u2019ll be working primarily in conjunction with Miss Takhana Veil. Relate all of the information you find to her, and she\u2019ll add it to the files, sort it, parse it, and deliver to me coherent report of your findings.\u201d", "1467405476000": "\u201cNot at present, no. But I don\u2019t think you should leave quite so soon. This is a matter of great importance, but low urgency.  Part of your job now is to prepare yourself to take my place, if necessary. If you\u2019re constantly out, adventuring about, the people of Isra will never know you, and you won\u2019t know how Isra works. The Winterlands will be there next week. You\u2019ve only just returned to Isra. Spend another night or two, do some research, and acquaint yourself more closely with your comrades. Such is my suggestion.\u201dWith that said, Naoki shrugs slightly; noncommittally. Ema could do with more than simply the one friend, she thinks. Spending some time socialising in the name of preparation would probably do her well. ", "1470708649000": "Through a side door, using one of the many keys on her ring, Madame Naoki enters The Midnight Sun. It\u2019s been a while, she reflects, making her way into the primary service room. Been awhile since she\u2019s spent a few hours in one of the booths with Artemis, sharing drinks and discussing the passing patrons silently. The slightest hint of a frown crosses her face as she becomes aware of the fact it\u2019s unlikely that they ever will again, outside of intentionally for nostalgic reasons. Hmmph. On this occasion, coming directly from The Citadel, Naoki finds herself wearing one of what seem to have become her trademark loose white blouse - black pleated skirt combos. Regardless, she expunged the melancholy thought from her mind as she moves swiftly over to a vacant table; today she\u2019s here on business. Gesticulating, she catches the eye of one of the wait staff, a young woman who is, while somewhat pretty, not particularly noteworthy, other than the fact that she was only hired in the last month. Painting a polite sort of smile over her grimace, Naoki greets the woman and spends a half-moment to introduce herself before simply requesting that she have one of the more veteran bartenders make her something to drink. Nodding slowly to herself and wholly forgetting to verbally acknowledge the request, or even so much as provide her name the waitress departs. With the matter of her drink (hopefully) attended to for the time being, Naoki settles back into her seat and sets her eyes roving across the current set of patrons. At least there are a few familiar faces there, she muses, grumbling quietly to herself. ", "1472330428000": "Ashur would find the majority of the booths to be occupied. It\u2019s a busy night, at peak hours, at that. Rowdy sorts of men with flagons full of ale, well dressed gentleman with fair ladies to their sides, and at least one booth is occupied by what would seem to be about ten goblins. However, one booth sits mostly empty. Empty- save for the woman seated in it.In the far back of the right side of the booth, leaning against one wall is a woman, dressed quite well in a loose, white blouse and a pair of well made and form-fitting but otherwise more or less nondescript pair of black trousers. The more interesting feature of her appearance, however, one might find to be her ears. Her cat ears, apparently. They sit atop her head as if they own the place, one perked up and moving about slightly, the other sort of lazily drooping off to one side. Though a drink sits before the woman in a black mug, she doesn\u2019t seem to have noticed it, what with being asleep and all. How she fell asleep here, of all places, is anyone\u2019s guess, but she would seem to be. Either that, or pretending. Or perhaps simply \u2018resting her eyes\u2019. Regardless, the entire bench across from the woman and some of the bench she\u2019s sitting on is, indeed, empty. Alternatively, there are surely some other empty seats somewhere in this bar- it\u2019s quite big. It would of course be up to the individual. ", "1472332224000": "As he slides in, the active ear turns to face him directly, resting on him for a moment before diverting its attention elsewhere. The woman herself makes no visible reaction. However, with the increased proximity, Ashur might notice the woman\u2019s earring- pierced into her right ear. It would seem to be a cabochon amethyst, worn button style. Which, in and of itself, is hardly worth noting, save for the fact that hers is glimmering rather furiously, and glowing slightly with a purplish sort of tinge. Beyond that, it doesn't appear to be doing anything in particular. Not visibly, at least. Observing the bar, one might notice any number of things. Firstly and foremost, the diversity of its patrons; it\u2019s a veritable grab-bag of races and creatures. A tall, elvish gentleman sipping something black that sparkles. A blatantly obvious demon of some variety, sharing a conversation with one of the barkeeps: someone who would seem to be simply a somewhat handsome man, save for his brightly lime colored hair. Beyond the radical racial diversity, the bar also seems to be serving all manner of mixtures that aren\u2019t quite the standard set of alcoholic beverages. That drink right there- that\u2019s definitely a bright red color, and judging by the fangs on the man that ordered it, it may very well be straight blood. But over there, another man has a tall glass of some manner of golden drink. It ripples and undulates constantly, as if it might be molten gold itself. Yet, the man puts it away as if it were simply some manner of ale. Other such unique beverages are scattered about among the more easily identifiable ales, beers, and wines, but it would be tedious to detail each one. The whole thing seems to function more or less smoothly. The barkeeps are skilled in their craft and not slow by any means, and though a few heated discussions can be picked out of the din, there is no shouting, and none of the other patrons within sight seem to be causing any issues- either amongst themselves or with the staff. Around the room, primarily focused on the dining area the booth is technically a component of, waiters and waitresses putter about with platters of food. Some of them wear black suits or dresses with The Midnight Sun\u2019s Logo emblazoned on their lapels. Others, curiously enough, are wearing what would seem to be bunny outfits, with corsets and ear headbands and such. Additionally, it should be noted that at the far end of the table where it meets the wall, a wooden tablet sits, and a menu has been written upon it.

Fixing Ashur Steele  with her amber gaze, she sizes him up. An interesting sort of thing he is, she muses. Excessively muscular for how old he would seem to be otherwise. Large scar, too, and with that armor- a fighter, more likely than not. And the eyes. Evidently, whoever this is, they\u2019re about par for the course at The Midnight Sun. Shifting slightly in her seat and molding her face into an expression of passive indifference, she extends one hand to bring her mug up to her lips for a sip before placing it back down on the table, holding her gaze on the stranger across the table as she does so.

After a moment spent in reminiscence of the last occasion she was approached about a job in this very same booth, she responds, \u201cI employ directly and indirectly about thirty percent of all Isra. Generally speaking, whatever proficiencies you may have, I would be willing to pay you to practice them for my uses. The only question comes in what manner of services you would like to offer. You seem a fighter- a warrior, even. Would you prefer an occupation in that field?\u201d ", "1472616440000": "The waitress nods without saying a word and departs to have his drink mixed. She\u2019ll presumably be back in a moment or so. Naoki nods slowly. Yet another job seeker come to seek her out, with a whole slew of talents and no real idea of how they\u2019d like to use them. The trend continues. After spending a moment or so in contemplation, Naoki responds with another inquiry, \u201cWhat level of commitment are you looking for? A quick purse of coins? A few years of honest work to fund something, or perhaps a longer term arrangement?\u201d", "1472617006000": "\u201cFair enough.\u201dResting her chin in her hand, Naoki looks across the table at Ashur, sizing him up and trying to figure what sort of role he might best be suited for. The most obvious solution would be to recommend him to The Sun Marshals, but only just having met the fellow, she doesn\u2019t feel as if she knows him well enough- or vice versa, to place him in such a high station. In an attempt to begin to remedy this, she poses another question, \u201cIt would seem like you know who I am, but do you have a name? Tell me a bit about yourself.\u201d", "1472653049000": "Ashur may find that he has received more than he bargained for in the drink department, however. The mix sitting before him is an item on the secret menu, and that is the case due to the extreme potency of it. The name \u2018Hellfire\u2019 is well deserved, as the drink itself appears as liquid flames.In the making of his Hellfire, one shot each of Dragon\u2019s Roar and Nightfyre were added to a pint of Manastorm, and the powerful blend of alchemical compounds in each component react strongly, producing one of the strongest alcohols The Midnight Sun offers legally. To date, only three individuals have been able to walk a straight line after finishing a pint of Hellfire. However, regardless of how the alcoholic content may or may not affect Ashur, he would find his magical abilities- if he has any, to be considerably less taxing to cast for a time following consumption, due to the drink\u2019s base of Manastorm, which itself is an alchemical beverage that produces such effects.  Across from him, Naoki watches with mild amusement as he begins to down the drink. Presuming that he\u2019ll only be conscious for a few minutes more, Naoki increases the tempo of her voice, attempting to impart her knowledge before he passes out.\u201cI think that you would be best suited working with a friend of mine, over at The Black Tower. When you\u2019re finished here, take a right, continue down that road until it terminates, then head right again. That\u2019ll take you to the avenue leading to the Southern Gate. Proceed out it, and The Black Tower will be visible to your left. If you tell the guards that you\u2019re looking for work with them, they ought to let you in and hear you out.\u201d", "1472884212000": "Watching him depart, Naoki shakes her head slightly. The sheer number of apparently steel-livered individuals kicking about has really ruined the novelty, she thinks. It\u2019s almost more unusual to become inebriated than it is to not. Hmmph. However, Naoki herself has no intention of getting drunk. Not tonight. Instead, she continues to sit quietly with her mug, sipping at it on and off as she observes the proceedings of the bar. In a strange sort of way, she finds it soothing. For as much as other things have changed, The Midnight Sun itself has remained more or less the same, and there\u2019s some comfort to be found in that. At some point, Ashur\u2019s empty pint glass is whisked away, but Naoki continues to sit, occasionally having her mug refilled, but otherwise simply observing. ", "1473274378000": "After Takhana and Zaor have seated themselves and had a few moments to settle into their seats and come to terms with the features of the room, they are treated to a few minutes of silence. Even through the silencing runes, the din of the floors below makes itself present in oscillating murmurs that sometimes vibrate the floor. The candelabra overhead burns away quietly. Just as one might begin to say something, to offer some manner of comment, or otherwise break the silence of the room, Madame Naoki beats them to it, pushing the door open without preamble or fanfare. For this meeting of meetings, it seems as she has chosen to wear one of one of her sweater dresses, a longer, sort of burgundy-colored one that nearly comes down to her knees. To match the pigmentation of her dress, an uncharacteristic bit of color seems to have seeped its way onto her face as well. Whether it is the result of exertion, embarrassment, or some other cause entirely is hard to say. Regardless, as she enters the room, Naoki deposits a small handbag just to the side of the door before raising a hand in greeting to the room\u2019s occupants. \u201cMr. Brytis, I presume, and Takhana.\u201d She inclines her head in greeting to each of them in turn before moving to seat herself. However, before Naoki can finish seating herself, and before the door can finish closing behind her, it is again pushed open. Into the room comes handsome, but not otherwise fairly plain looking waiter. In one hand, he holds a small notepad, presumably for taking orders upon. He looks to Takhana and Zaor expectantly as Naoki seem to be having some manner of issue settling her tail into the chair.

He complies with a nod of his own, excusing himself from the room and ensuring the door shuts properly on the way out. Turning back to the table and the matters at hand, Naoki nods almost imperceptibly in Takhana\u2019s direction. It was a good call to ask for snacks, Naoki thinks. A full meal would be a little much much, and more difficult, besides. The meal isn\u2019t intended to prolong the encounter, after all. With this spirit of expediency in mind, Naoki opts to, as she tends to, get right to the subject matter, already having offered her greetings. \u201cAs you\u2019ve probably heard, I\u2019m looking to open a public library in Isra. The majority of its affairs have already been settled or planned in sufficient detail. I\u2019ve had a location picked out, contracted my construction company, a handful of carpenters, and the marble for the building is being transported as we speak.\u201dAs she lists these various provisions, Naoki counts on her fingers. \u201cHowever,\u201d she continues, dropping one hand into the other, \u201cThe primary thing I\u2019m missing at this point is someone to run the whole thing. \u2026 I sort of already have a day-job, and most of the others I know who might be qualified do as well. This leaves me in a bit of a funny spot, but as I hear, you seem like just the gentleman for it\u2026?\u201dHere, she trails off, intending to prompt @faeprince  to elaborate as to his qualifications. ", "1475572658000": "With a decidedly reserved air, Naoki sits quietly, listening as Zaor speaks his bit. He seems to be an interesting sort, she muses. She didn\u2019t expect anything less, but he strikes her as one with considerably more to him than meets the eye. Not having been given a full explanation of his past, Naoki\u2019s curiosity is piqued, but quickly dismissed. It\u2019s probably a very sensitive topic, given the circumstances Takhana found him in. Nodding quietly, Naoki responds, \u201cFair enough, then. You seem exactly the sort that would do well- it would be more than simply an occupation for you. With the understanding that you be willing to learn any necessary administrative skills that you may be lacking, I would be happy to offer you the position.\u201dSomewhat surprised at how quickly and easily the matter seems to have been settled, Naoki extends her hand across the table toward @faeprince , presumably for shaking.", "1477437153000": "Reciprocating with a light smile of her own, Naoki shakes his hand. Her grip is warm, and firm, but not at all unfriendly. She responds, \u201cLikewise, allow me to thank you. You\u2019ll be doing a great service for the city, advancing the spread of knowledge and the dissemination of information.\u201dTurning slightly to return Takhana\u2019s \u2018gaze\u2019, Naoki continues, \u201cIt is underway as we speak. You can visit the site over on the east side of the city. It ought to be completed in\u2026\u201d For a moment, she pauses, considering the matter. \u201cPerhaps the coming month,\u201d she concludes. \u201cBetween now and then, I would suggest that you, Mr. Brytis, begin to seek out scribes and more librarians to assist you. It\u2019s to be a fairly large building, you\u2019ll probably need perhaps twenty or thirty others to effectively run it, along with however many scribes you might like to create copies. \u2026 I\u2019ll have some paperwork sent to you regarding not only your own employment but also administrative things regarding hiring individuals yourself and managing the library\u2019s budget. If all goes well, in forty days\u2019 time, the library will be open and operating.\u201dThe way she speaks of it, Naoki seems rather pleased with the concept. Free and unfettered access to books isn\u2019t something that she had, but it ought to be a very beneficial sort of thing for Isra\u2019s youth. Not everyone can or would care to hire tutors, so allowing children to educate themselves- while perhaps a bit optimistic for Naoki to hope for, is at least a good opportunity to provide, she thinks.

It\u2019s fairly simple, though. Employment forms, expense and investment request forms. Technically the library will be set up as a sanctioned business of the state, so its finances will go through the Treasury Department. \u2026 So feel free to begin reaching out to potential employees as soon as you\u2019d like.\u201dGlancing back and forth between Takhana and Zaor, Naoki considers for a moment if she has anything else much more to discuss. It would seem as if she doesn\u2019t, so she articulates as such, \u201cI don\u2019t believe that I have anything further to say or discuss for the moment. Do either of you have any questions, or\u2026?\u201d", "1480980432000": "Shortly after being informed that Ms. Moonflower had entered The Midnight Sun, Madame Naoki enters via her usual back door. For this occasion, she isn\u2019t wearing anything in particular- or rather, of particular note. Just a sweater and long sort of skirt, same as she wore to The Citadel. She doesn\u2019t figure that this is to be a particularly formal meeting and knows that she won\u2019t be actively attempting to advance on Ms. Moonflower, so there\u2019s not any pressing reason to wear anything special. Still, she proceeds. Alli\u2019s accompaniment is unneeded due to the heavy security and warding still in place at The Sun, and it seems as if Forni is asleep. Which is perfectly fine. As Naoki approaches the table she designated, she notes that one of the wait staff is already on standby just around the corner, and she offers him a small smile as she passes. It\u2019s somewhat reassuring to see that The Sun is largely running itself, even in Skarlet\u2019s absence. Walking up to the table, Naoki looks toward Ms. Moonflower, with the intent of assessing her. The first thing that jumps out is the infant, which was to be expected, bearing in mind how she was the last time they met at Alden\u2019s house. Beyond that, she seems outwardly well enough, and there also seems to be a box of some description on the floor. Interesting. Raising a hand in greeting as she takes her seat at the table, Naoki opens with the simplest of greetings, \u201cHello, Ms. Moonflower.\u201d Her tone is light, friendly, without any particular sort of undercurrent, but also not particularly chipper. ", "1481443674000": "As Moon begins to speak, Naoki sits up very straight in her seat and angles her gaze down some as to attempt to peek over the edge of the blanket holding the baby. It seems like she\u2019s still listening, but interested in observing the child. As Moon shifts him, Naoki shifts in response, leaning down and forward to put her face on level with his and stare right back, smiling slightly. \u201cThings are alright. I\u2019ll not say fantastic, and I\u2019ll not say horribly, but there are times as if it feels like both. There are problems, personal and professional that I cannot solve. Sometimes the most basic natures of how the world works stand in my way on matters I care very much about. \u2026\u201dHere, there is a moment\u2019s pause during which the felliniesque woman seems somewhat obviously troubled. It doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s making much effort to disguise her feelings, generally speaking.\u201cBut..! I\u2019m able to beat them sometimes, and there are areas in which I make great successes. Beyond that, there are, as one might imagine, a lot of stresses involved with making decisions that stand to affect thousands and in some cases the entire world, but I also find great satisfaction in improving the lives of my citizens and such. There are small things, lack of crime, clean water, security, that mean the world to some people. A lot of refugees have been arriving as of late, and I especially like to look on as they\u2019re told that food is provided to all citizens that need it. I\u2019m very satisfied with that policy, still think it\u2019s economically profitable in the long run, aside from the obvious bit in which people don\u2019t starve.\u201dA smug sort of smirk makes itself present at this juncture, and Naoki returns her attention to the baby in Moon\u2019s arms and attempting to grasp at what sorts of things aside from the obvious would betray its gender. \u201cHow about you and yours? I\u2019ve heard that your pregnancy ended reasonably well, as evidenced, but not much more beyond that. It\u2019s my understanding that living conditions in the human portions of Alban are...\u201d she pauses for a moment, considering how to word her thought. \u201c... still not quite what they once were,\u201d she finishes, intending to allude to how Alban is said to have been before the revolt and the following coup some twenty years past.", "1481805431000": "Dec 11, 2016 12:00:02 GMT -8 Moonflower L\u00e0idir said:\"Ah.\" The single syllable response, more sound than actual word, carried a weight of understanding. Moon knew quite well how it was to feel like things were both fantastic and horrible all at once. It was a position she'd been in more than a few times herself, and she gave Naoki a look that was brimming with empathy. She'd not been particularly close with the leader of Isra, but she thought they'd developed something akin to a budding friendship, which was part of what had drawn her to visit the city rather than simply having the gift she'd brought shipped over. A smile spread across her lips as Naoki expanded upon her accomplishments and satisfaction, and she shifted Alden again as he babbled, reaching out chubby hands toward Naoki - specifically, toward her ears.\"Ahh, well, I managed to survive the experience, barely. Apparently my body isn't quite made for childbirth and I hemorrhaged and nearly died in the process. But I'm alright now, fully recovered, and little Alden here is happy and healthy. Mihael - my husband - is an amazing father, and his parents are extremely supportive and helpful. Things in Alban are steadily getting better. Relations with the other races are improving, the people are starting to intermingle again, the destroyed portions of the city are being rebuilt. It's pretty fascinating to watch a nation that was on the verge of destroying itself struggling back to stability, and it's.. indescribable to be even a small part of it.\"Balancing her inquisitive son easily in the curve of her arm, his body resting against her chest, she reached out toward the box that was resting nearby and tapped its lid with a fingertip.\"Awkward segue, but fallen nations are somewhat related to why I'm here. My husband's father is originally from Katashima, and he's shown me some drawings of what the place was like, and well.. with a little help from him, I made something for you. I thought it was best delivered in person, which is why I came. Also I thought you might want to meet Alden.\" This was said with a smile as Alden giggled and burbled at the High Lady. When Naoki unlatched the box and lifted the lid, within its confines she'd see an extremely elaborate chess set that was undeniably inspired by the fallen nation of Katashima. She'd been hard at work on it during her time recovering from her near-death experience, and the craftsmanship showed just how much time and focus she'd poured into the project.Though mildly amused, Naoki does not lean forward to allow Little Alden to grab her ears. That would be weird, and besides the fact that she doesn\u2019t very much enjoy to have her ears manhandled. She does, however, lean forward enough to extend a hand across the table, and puts her index finger within his grasp, such that he might grasp at that  for a short while. In this manner, Naoki listens on as Moonflower continues to speak, expressing surprise and concern as childbirth difficulties are mentioned, but otherwise simply listening. Her next question was to be \u201cWhat\u2019s his name,\u201d but it proves unnecessary.Instead, Naoki offers, \u201cGood, good, on all counts. I had feared worse.\u201dAs Moon goes on to introduce the gift, Naoki raises her eyebrows with the sort of mild and pleasant surprise one expresses when receiving a gift. She had suspected something to that extent, but even so. Glancing down to the box and back across the table, Naoki responds, \u201cThank you. I\u2019m rather curious, so if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019m going to have a look\u2026\u201dAssuming no objections are raised, Naoki proceeds to slide over a bit and lift the box from the floor, almost smacking it into her face, surprised by how light it is compared to how it looks like it ought to weigh. But after this initial surprise, she places it onto the table, orienting it such that the latch faces her. It only takes a moment to undo the latch and lift the lid with one hand, which has the side effect of blocking the line of sight between Naoki and Moon. For a moment, there is relative silence. Then, \u201cOh, wow,\u201d is simply stated. There is a wooden sort of movement sound as Naoki removes one of the pawns to hold in her free hand and examine, and after a moment longer, Naoki lowers the lid low enough to peer over it and offer the following, \u201cThis is beautiful. I had intended to visit you in Alban and overpay for a chess set you had already made for sale. I didn\u2019t expect you to take the initiative to create something especially for me - something as exceptional as this - and then travel all the way over here to deliver it in person. I appreciate this, thank you.\u201d With this, Naoki offers a nod of thanks and proceeds to replace the pawn in its respective slot, shut the lid, and fasten the latch. Then, she proceeds to fix Moon with an appraising and somewhat contemplative look, raising one eyebrow and leaning back slightly in her seat.\u201cI must return the favor. Do you find yourself needing, wanting something, anything in particular?\u201d", "1481836619000": "Listening and making note of Moon\u2019s apparent discomfort, Naoki smiles a bit. Not at the discomfort, per say, but the admission. It relates directly back to what Naoki was getting at earlier, deriving satisfaction from appreciation. While it is somewhat inherently pleasant to do \u2018the right thing\u2019 and be generous, Naoki finds it justified in a way when gratitude is expressed. In any case, it seems as if Naoki has an idea of some manner, judging by how the \u201cYes, but I\u2019m also going to give you something now. \u2026. Or rather, shortly, it\u2019ll take some time to get here. Actually- two somethings, as well as dinner, I\u2019ll insist.\u201dTo this extent, a member of the wait staff approaches, apparently having been signaled to do so. He has but a single item, a basket which is filled with rolls. He places it on the table, and, at a hand signal from Naoki, picks up the box containing the chess set, takes about three steps, and places it atop a nearby cabinet. Then he departs. From the basket, Naoki selects the topmost roll and holds it aloft for gesticulation as she speaks of the contents of the basket, \u201cCheese bread if you\u2019d like - still warm. They take the dough, lay it out flat in a sort of ovular shape, cut some lines into it in a particular sort of way, lay some cheese down the center, fold it in some specific manner, and then bake it. You get this sort of spiral shape, with the cheese baked into it. I quite like them, but if you\u2019d prefer something else, just say the word, the kitchen pride itself on being able to cook almost any dish. Something for Alden, perhaps.\u201dWith this, Naoki offers a small sort of apologetic shrug as she takes a bite of her pastry, unsure of Little Alden\u2019s age or if he\u2019s still exclusively breastfeeding or whatever the case may be. Still, she figured it best to offer.", "1482274900000": "Without anything in particular to say, Naoki looks on quietly as Moonflower feeds little Alden and has some of the bread herself. Silently, she muses on such things as \u2018If there\u2019s much more naming children after each other, it\u2019s going to be supremely difficult to navigate any situation wherein all of the parents and children are in the same room\u2019, and \u2018Gee, I sure am glad that I didn\u2019t have to do any of these early childhood stages with Skarlet.\u2019 At Moon\u2019s comment on the differences between Isra and Alban, Naoki offers a few, non-committal nods, and gathers her thoughts before responding, \u201cI can\u2019t offer much, as I\u2019ve never really lived anywhere other than cities, but I feel like I know what you mean. There\u2019s a certain business in Isra that isn\u2019t really present anywhere else, that gets rather tiring if one doesn\u2019t isolate themselves from it every so often.\u201dAfter finishing her bit of bread, Naoki continues, \u201cAnd that actually makes for an excellent segue into the first thing I have for you. Which isn\u2019t quite so much a gift as it is a standing sort of offer. As it so happens, I have a house up in the mountains.\u201dWith one hand, Naoki points into a direction off to her left, which - if one were to be keen with their sense of direction - one would recognize as a direction that leads up into the Norkari mountains. \u201cBig place, very nice, very scenic, quite cozy, I spared no expense. The architect who designed it named it Chalet du Sommet Minuit, which is roughly Gauldish for \u2018cottage of the midnight mountaintop\u2019. Which is a bit of a misnomer as it\u2019s actually located in a valley and significantly larger than a cottage, but I digress. It is my home, and, to varying degrees, the home of those who are close to me. I would like to extend an offer to you, such that if something ever happens to your home, to your family, to Alban, or to the world at large; if you or your family ever need somewhere to live and be safe, now or at any time in the future, temporarily or for the indefinite future, there will be a place for you at my home.\u201d", "1482470036000": "Waving one hand dismissively and turning her head to one side, Naoki makes as if to brush off the thanks, but the smile on her face suggests that she doesn\u2019t very much mind.\u201cIf one were to consider states that could crumble at the drop of a metaphorical hat\u2026 Alban is very much up there. I mean no offense, but if my understanding is accurate, if anything were to happen to your King Averin or that sword of his, the whole nation would sink back into war, and in that situation, I don\u2019t think the human population of Alban fares well.\u201dThe term human is used loosely, of course, but Naoki figures the meaning is clear enough. However, it does lead her to wonder if Little Alden here has inherited any of his mother\u2019s wolven bits. Ask about that later, perhaps.  \u201cI\u2019m not going to see you or your family as one or some of many refugees, so if things start looking at all questionable, get out as quick as you possibly can, come stay up with me, and go back later if it turns out to be safe to do so and you\u2019d like to. Better to come when you might not need to than to be denied the opportunity to come at all.\u201dAs Naoki is speaking, another individual approaches their table. Rather than the server that had delivered the basket of bread or any of his fellows, this individual is rather nondescript, one of many 30-something middle class men who might plausibly be a patron of The Midnight Sun, save for the fact that he wears a white scarf as a sort of sash over one shoulder. He simply approaches, places a small box at the end of the table, turns back about, and leaves, without offering any sort of greeting or even so much as making eye contact.\u201cBeyond that, the place is more than large enough for me to make offers such as that, and I\u2019m sure you would do the same in my place. In any case, this is the second thing, this box here, and the item within\u2026\u201dReaching over with her free hand, Naoki slides the box toward herself. It\u2019s a small - perhaps 3\u201d by 4\u201d by 1\u201d - nondescript wooden sort of thing, not of any particularly exquisite craftsmanship or ornamented in any particular way. It has a simple latch, which Naoki undoes, and then proceeds to open the box. She takes a moment to glance at the contents, assure herself that it\u2019s the right item, before turning the open side of the box to face Moonflower, and sliding it a bit in her direction, but not quite close enough to allow Little Alden to grab it.The item within the box is a vial of clear glass, just large enough to have to be placed into the box at an angle to fit. Within, there seems to be a liquid, a translucent sort of uniform, off-whitish liquid that seems to be undulating a bit and sparking as it does so. The vial is capped with a cork that seems fairly standard, and some brass wiring has been wrapped around the vial in such a way to hold it securely, and a string has been attached to the brass wiring, such that one could wear the whole ensemble as a necklace, or replace the string with something else and keep it secure by some other means.\u201cThis here, this vial, is a potion, a product of alchemy, and a highly advanced one, at that. It doesn\u2019t have a name in the common tongue, only in a dialect of ancient elvish, which I cannot even begin to pronounce. In fact, it was, until perhaps four weeks ago, more or less lost and forgotten knowledge. I went to great lengths to recover the knowledge and then produce some - it took me a few tries. I think the name translates very roughly to \u2018Unicorn Tears\u2019. Not because any unicorns or unicorn products were involved in the creation of it, but presumably because its function is similar to the fabled function of the tears of unicorns: healing of extreme potency.\u201dAs she speaks, Naoki does as she tends to, and gesticulates with her hands to add emphasis and punctuation where appropriate. \u201cIt\u2019s a sort of restorative, see. Not quite like other potions of healing, because it sort of works to restore what was there, instead of what it thinks ought to be there, and the two aren\u2019t necessarily the same. I have a suspicion that it does this by looking into the past in some way, perhaps as a seer might, but I can\u2019t quite be sure. In any case, it\u2019s capable of healing more or less any would or mutilation one might receive, and is effective on a terribly wide range of beings. I\u2019ve not done extensive tests, and the texts certainly aren\u2019t very helpful in this regard, but this batch that I\u2019ve created - of which this is a single vial of - has worked on men and women here in Isra, as well as a Volkrim - a race of primarily bipedal wolf-people, they live up in the Norkari Mountains. Along with healing grievous wounds and alleviating a few sicknesses, the tears here have also apparently worked to reverse the effects of aging to a degree, interestingly enough. Again, I haven\u2019t yet had the opportunity to do any sort of conclusive testing, but a man of sixty who had his hand crushed seemed to become taller, apparently appearing as he did perhaps ten years previously. His hand healed fully as well.\u201d\u201cI would like you to take this vial, keep it safe, hold onto it, explain its function to a few individuals who you can trust, and perhaps use it to save some lives. Only a drop or two into the mouth of whoever you intend to treat should do it. They should, if they can, eat something at the same time, that\u2019ll help. Then, it will do what it does over the course of the next forty-eight hours. I wouldn\u2019t suggest administering any more than that, but I also don\u2019t really know what effects doing so might have.\u201dAt this, Naoki offers a small shrug, intending to further impress that this is very much a new and uncertain thing. Or, an ancient, forgotten and recently rediscovered thing, of which not much of the old knowledge has been recovered.\u201cOne might also be able to utilise the deaging effect to artificially lengthen one\u2019s life, but I also wouldn\u2019t quite recommend that. The substance may have some manner of as of yet unseen side effects if applied multiple times. Can\u2019t be sure. I intend to look into it, and I\u2019ll let you know what I find out, but until then, don\u2019t administer the stuff regularly.\"Glancing away from Moonflower toward Little Alden, Naoki hesitates for the space of a moment before continuing, \"\u2026 I also don\u2019t have any data at all about how it might affect young children, so I would also suggest avoiding administering it to Little Alden unless absolutely necessary until there until he\u2019s got a few years on him.\u201dThough Naoki is fully aware she\u2019s talking her jaw off, she continues, \u201cAnd further, keep in mind that if someone you care about requires medical attention, you absolutely have the option of sending a messenger to Isra, and I would be more than willing to send some of my medical personnel over there, with their professional expertise and whatnot. The same goes for if you need anything else, I owe you a favor and would be more than willing to assist you in whatever manner you might require on account of my holding you in high regard. ... It\u2019s just that\u2026 that I\u2019ve got a whole lot of this stuff, this\u00a0Unicorn Tears substance, that I went to great lengths to research and produce, and now I need to do something with it, so I\u2019m distributing it about in the hope that it will be used in productive ways. To friends, the aforementioned medical personnel, Sun Marshals,\u201d Naoki nods her head in the direction that the man who delivered the box departed in, suggesting that he was a Marshal.\u201c...Officers in Isra\u2019s armed forces, and other individuals who would have a high chance of needing to use it. Save some limbs, some lives. Such is my hope, at least.\u201dAnother small sort of shrug is offered with this, the end of her spiel. As she neared the conclusion, Naoki\u2019s demeanor shifted gradually to become somewhat more subdued, rather somber, but not to the point of being off-putting or hostile. With her whole bit said, she folds her hands before her, and sits quietly, looking across the table for Moon\u2019s response.", "1483392904000": "\u201cMmmh,\u201d Naoki acknowledges Moon\u2019s statement in a noncommittal sort of way as she considers it. Largely unaware of Moon\u2019s life story, Naoki at first finds it somewhat strange that Moon finds it her generosity somewhat strange - few people have to date - but supposes that, to be fair, the things she\u2019s just given her are fairly \u2018large\u2019 things, and very few individuals would be able to offer anything even mildly comparable. And further, in hindsight, Naoki supposes she felt generally the same way about some things before coming to Isra but didn\u2019t voice as much at the time. All things considered, Naoki supposes she has an understanding of what Moon is getting at. That said, Naoki isn\u2019t completely sure how to proceed from this point, so she opts for her usual response in situations such as these and shrugs. \u201cYou gave a generous gift, and so did I. What defines \u2018generous\u2019 has a relation to how much one has to give, as I see it. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s quite worth being troubled with. In any case, would you like something to eat, or?...\u201dTrailing off, Naoki intends to leave the statement ambiguous and open-ended. ", "1483770787000": "While not caught off guard by the question itself, Naoki isn\u2019t entirely sure what the appropriate response is. If she should be happy to hold Alden, if he should be happy to be held by her, or what. As such, she continues to smile and nod and proceeds to adjust herself slightly in her seat, sitting more straightly up in presumed preparation for Moonflower to stand and transfer Little Alden to her. Which is probably how it would best be done, she presumes with a substantial amount of doubt. Naoki does her best not to seem troubled as she begins to seriously consider what the ideal routing for Little Alden would be in this situation. ", "1483857919000": "Though she hasn\u2019t personally held very many small children in her time, it isn\u2019t particularly difficult to observe how others do it and mimic that, and so Naoki does, and manages to receive Little Alden more or less gracefully. Given the opportunity, she stares right back down at him, being careful to maintain a gentle, slightly smiling expression the entire time. After simply holding him for a short while Naoki opts to attempt to amuse the little fellow. To accomplish this, she begins to raise one of her eyebrows up, and simultaneously, swivels her ear on that side of her head to match. Then, she repeats the motion with the other side of her face, and in this manner, repeats the gesture a few times, moving the two sides independently and together and such in a way that she hopes comes off as entertaining. Simultaneously, Naoki addresses Moonflower out of the corner of her mouth, asking, \u201cHow old did you say he was?...\u201d", "1483993276000": "Naoki's endeavor to amuse Little Alden was met with great success, as he kicked his little feet, waved his little hands, and cackled joyously, all the while reaching those chubby fingers up towards her ears. He was quite familiar with people with feline attributes, thanks to his passel of 'cousins', who took great pleasure in playing with him - as much as they could, anyway, given the size and age difference involved. Moon chuckled and settled into her seat again, content that Naoki could more than handle her energetic son while he was enjoying himself.\"About five months. I guess it's his human half, he's maturing a little more slowly than I did. I'm not complaining, though. He's pretty adorable.\" There was the look of a proud parent on her face, a smile on her lips as pale eyes watched her son with blatant love and adoration. He was everything to her.. the only person who even came close in her esteem was Mihael.Rather pleased with her success so far and not one to simply achieve her goal and leave it at that, Naoki ponders the option of going a bit further. Perhaps making amusing noises, or leaning down to allow him to grab at her ear. But then, she remembers that she\u2019s supposed to be a powerful head of state, and this baby is teething, and as such, decides to not. Instead, she simply continues on as she is and begins to rock him slightly from one side to the other. Though she doesn\u2019t look up at Moonflower or turn an ear to listen closely to what she has to say, Naoki evidently did, as she responds with a measured sort of \u201cMmmhm.\u201d That\u2019s an interesting thing to consider, she thinks. Aging, and its relative speed. Life expectancy, and development. Upon her visit to 13 Riverside Drive, she had considered the topic idly\u00a0but hadn't quite realized at the time how very pronounced it was/is in that case. Admittedly, her namesake is a smart little thing, but she was only two at the time, and that's far too young to be writing letters. That\u2019s absurd. It leads one to wonder, will that accelerated pace of aging remain throughout their lives, on account of their feline half? That would be terrible. Alden would likely outlive his children. Naoki supposes that he might regardless on account of his runes, but even so. Glancing upward, Naoki\u2019s focus lingers for a moment on Ms. Moonflower, and the necklace Naoki is aware that she\u2019s wearing. Then, back down to continue entertaining Little Alden, though perhaps a bit more thoughtfully than before. To continue making conversation, she asks, \u201cIs there anything you can think of that you\u2019re going to need to raise him that you don\u2019t have yet? Tutors, books, good clothing, any of that?\u201d", "1484165083000": "Jan 10, 2017 14:37:34 GMT -8 Moonflower L\u00e0idir said:Whether or not Naoki decided to go further with her attempts to entertain Little Alden, the child seemed more than content to remain as things were, still giggling and wriggling within her grasp, though not enough to make it difficult for her to hold him. He was admittedly rather strong, especially for his age, but much like his mother, he had an innate sense of when to utilize and when not - doing so while someone of unknown strength and ability was holding him was dangerous to the pup, and so he wouldn't risk his own safety. Moon tilted her head thoughtfully as Naoki posed her questions, and then shrugged.\"I hadn't really put much thought into it. Mihael's parents are nobility, and he's got a fairly high-ranking position in the Albish knights, so I guess when the time comes, it will be pretty easy to get him a good education and the like. Then again, I didn't have any of that, and I suppose I turned out alright.\" A vaguely amused grin tilted her lips as she made that confession. She wasn't as intelligent as Naoki, admittedly - she knew how to read and write, how to count and do basic math, and the ways of her chosen profession, but most of her knowledge was purely instinctual or gained while living in the wild. She was an oddity, for certain.Nodding a bit noncommittally, Naoki responds, \u201cFair enough. Again, I don\u2019t really know much about the state of things there are over there. That, and my nationalism suspects that regardless of whatever education options are available in Alban, there are higher quality options here in Isra.\u201dWith this, Naoki offers one of her characteristic smirks, though it lacks some of the character it might otherwise have due to her preoccupation. It is at this point, Naoki begins to ponder what else she has to say, and realizes that there isn\u2019t very much. Could start monologuing again, she supposes, but nothing jumps to mind as particularly relevant, and she should probably let the pair of them go. Or perhaps Alden is coming here with his children. It isn\u2019t as if there\u2019s a better place to eat. In any case, Naoki drops the leading side of the conversation, allowing Ms. Moonflower to direct it from this point forward in whatever direction she sees fit.Meanwhile, Naoki seems to have caved on the whole image thing, as she\u2019s proceeded to pause with the faces, stick the tongue of her tongue out, and blowing about as dignified a raspberry as is possible in Little Alden\u2019s direction. ", "1484399386000": "Nodding along, Naoki intends to express that, yes, that\u2019s what she was getting at, she means to offer options that might not necessarily be available otherwise.However, upon noticing Little Alden\u2019s expression and the smell and the smell that follows shortly thereafter, Naoki\u2019s facial expression freezes in place for a moment, before quietly dropping the excessive character it had taken on. Similarly, the thoughts she was forming about how to respond verbally are abandoned. She looks up toward  Moonflower, seemingly the definition of placid. \u201cYes,\u201d she says. \u201cPlease.\u201dAs Moonflower would presumably approach, Naoki holds Little Alden in such a way as to make it somewhat easier for the transfer to take place with a minimal amount of rustling. ", "1484916053000": "After seeing Ms. Moonflower off with polite goodbyes and a pinched-shut nose, Naoki slides back into her seat, up on the balcony overlooking the bar. Hunching forward, she places an elbow on the table, her chin in her palm, and looks out across the mass of bar goers. It\u2019s strange, she reflects, how so much has changed, but The Midnight Sun remains almost exactly as it was. Same staff, same tables, same patrons, same drinks. Still turning incredible profits. There\u2019s one school of thought, she thinks, that says that this sameness is inherently bad; Calico ought to be attempting to further refine and perfect the system. But then, if it works, why fool with it. She supposes that she has little inclination to take any action regarding the matter, though, there are more pressing matters. On that note, Naoki turns a bit to shift her gaze onto the empty box sitting on the table. The box had contained the potion she had given Ms. Moonflower, the one Naoki has informally dubbed \u2018unicorn tears\u2019. It has properties that work against the natural progression of aging. Considering her previous thoughts on the concept of immortality, Naoki supposes that they\u2019ve changed quite drastically. It would certainly be awful to age at a drastically different scale compared to one who is important to you, or simply not age at all while others do. But then, there isn\u2019t much harm in it if whoever is important to one ages at the same rate, be it accelerated or decelerated... or perhaps even not at all. Considering the matter further, Naoki notes that of the individuals she knows well, there aren\u2019t too many similarities. Various types of humans and elves, demons, vampires, other assorted non-humans, including herself. All with their own speeds. Alden\u2019s children are far more developed than human children their age would be. And there is the line of thinking that says that fooling with the concept of aging would go against the natural order of things. Some just don\u2019t live as long as others, and that is the way of the world. It would be working against nature itself to change such things. Naoki is forced to admit that that line of thinking is entirely correct. But then, the ways of the world have not yet been able to prevent Naoki from accomplishing her goals in spite of them. ", "1493310137000": "In the early evening, as business is just beginning to pick up at The Sun, Lady Naoki is seated in a secluded booth up against one of the far walls. It\u2019s one of the larger, more luxurious booths, intended to be able to accommodate persons of above average size and to do so with more class than simply a rough wooden bench. Rather, it includes cushions, a clean and polished tabletop, inlaid runes, and other such trappings of respectable accommodations.The silencing runes are currently in effect, muffling the loud banter and clanking of glasses to a dull murmur. Though Naoki sits silently, any sounds made within the booth would also be rendered inaudible to any outside, providing privacy for those within. The sweet, cinnamon-smelling beverage Naoki seems to enjoy fills her mug, and Naoki sips at it occasionally as she waits for her guest, Torrin Delmirev, to arrive. ", "1493756780000": "Apr 28, 2017 12:05:20 GMT -8 Torrin Delmirev said:Naoki would not be kept waiting long, the large Dragonborn being one of those rare punctual types. He wore no armor or weaponry, just a plain black shirt and loose hide pants. Torrin spotted Lady Naoki and took a seat opposite her, the very top of his tail hanging out past the booth. \"Lady Naoki! A pleasure to see you looking so well on this fine day,\" he said jovially, a wide grin exposing his numerous sharp teeth.Offering a nod and a smile in greeting, Naoki responds, Likewise, Torrin. I trust you\u2019ve been well since we last met.\u201dBefore she continues, Naoki pauses to ensure that the booth\u2019s runic protections are active and functioning properly. Symbols of ancient magic glow faintly in the otherwise pristine tabletop, guaranteeing, among other things, that none outside the booth will be able to hear the conversation within.Satisfied, Naoki returns her attention to her guest and spends a moment to look him over. Torrin Delmirev, a seasoned warrior, and experienced leader. She had met him many months previously, through a mutual friend of theirs. He was employed at the time, and Naoki had no particular reason to seek his services, but the two had exchanged pleasantries. They have met by chance on a few occasions since then, and at this point could be considered friendly acquaintances. \u201cAs I mentioned, I have asked you here to discuss what I intend to develop into a mutually beneficial business relationship. It would involve you becoming employed as the leader of a unique branch of armed forces for The Free States of Isra.\u201dNaoki pauses to take a sip of her drink before continuing, \u201cWould you like something to eat or drink, or perhaps to discuss anything else before we begin?\u201dAs she awaits a response, her right-hand dips below the table into the pouch on her hip. From it, she pulls what appears to be a pearl, and idly begins to roll it between her fingers.", "1493961289000": "May 3, 2017 8:18:21 GMT -8 Torrin Delmirev said:\"I am well, indeed, I have brought you a gift from my Company's last excursion into the Mountains.\" He pulled a large, clear cut sapphire, similar in shape to an egg, with swirling red energy inside and set it on the table between them.\"Came from the hoard of the Great Wyrm Glancagon. My Company and I cleared it out a couple of weeks ago, and I know you have a fondness for such things. No clue what it does though, maybe one of the Enclave mages could tell you, my battlemages had no idea.\" Their mutual friend was none other than the former Commodore Elizabeth Finch, who hired his Company on occasion to deal with threats to the Griffins in the mountains. The wild griffins would attack the Riders on sight if they entered their territory with their griffins, so they would hire Torrin's Company to eliminate any threat to the wild griffin's survival. Torrin's group was comprised of some very large mercenaries; orcs, minotaurs, dragonborn, and the like. So they dealt with these threats in exchange for getting to keep the hoard of whatever they killed.\"I do recall the reason for our meeting, and am most intrigued by your offer. I would like some food and drink, it was a long journey, but I will defer to you as to what is good here.\"At the mention of a gift, Lady Naoki\u2019s eyebrows rise in surprise; she had not been expecting a gift. Perhaps he means to butter her up beforehand, she thinks. Regardless, as Torrin places the gemstone on the table, Naoki\u2019s eyes widen slightly as she leans in to examine it. \u201cOh, you know me too well\u2026\u201d she says, taking it between two fingers. In holding it up to the light of the chandelier above, Naoki notices the swirling energies within and quirks an eyebrow. These magics are not something she has seen before. They're\u2026 raw, and lacks direction. They are not at all like the carefully woven crystalline spell structures in her gems. She will indeed have her artificer look into this.\u201cThank you,\u201d Naoki continues, returning her attention to her guest. \u201cI appreciate this,\u201d she says, seeming quite sincere. Transferring her pearl from her right hand to her left, Naoki proceeds to place the sapphire in the pouch on her hip.\u201cAs for the food\u2026\u201d Trailing off, Naoki tilts her head slightly to one side, raising one ear directly up as she looks Torrin up and down, presumably to guess toward his taste in food.After a few moments, she offers, \u201cYou may enjoy the 'Black Pepper Beef Fritta'. It is made by taking a sort of egg mix and adding to it things such as the aforementioned pepper and beef, but also cheese, assorted vegetables, perhaps spices. The result is a somewhat\u2026 fluffy, but substantial dish.\u201dWith one finger, she gestures toward the bar and the list of drinks above it. \u201cThose are the drinks offered, but there are far more beneath the counter. The majority of the mixed drinks are strong, in the alchemical sense, as opposed to the strictly alcoholic, and I would prefer that you remain more or less sober tonight - at least until I\u2019m finished with you.\"For another moment she pauses, staring blankly off toward the drink menu before continuing as if she hadn't stopped speaking, \"With that in mind, I might suggest a bottle of Silverleaf, if you are partial to wine, and either Dragon\u2019s Roar or Blizzard, depending on if you would like a 'hot' or 'cold' mixed drink, respectively. Either that, or you could name any other sort of beverage, and it will come to this table.\u201dIn this, Naoki seems rather confident. The Sun\u2019s collection of alcohol is quite expansive. After taking a sip of her drink, Naoki looks toward Torrin for his thoughts.", "1494730827000": "Her hands raised in mock surrender, Naoki turns her head down and away, responding, \u201cI offer, I offer.\u201dAs Naoki moves back into her seat, she crosses one ankle over the other and continues, \u201cIn any case, it will arrive in a few minutes. In the meantime, allow me to introduce the premise of what I have in mind. My philosophy is \u2018business first, pleasure second,\u2019 so if you\u2019d like to discuss the weather, we can do that afterward as well.\u201dWithout missing a beat, she continues, \u201cI find myself in a position, here as the High Lady of Isra, where I am not quite comfortable. \u2026 Comfortable, in that, I am acutely aware that I am a public figure- a household name, perhaps the most well-known individual of our time. Easily among if not the wealthiest, and more politically powerful than most guess.\u201d  In these self-descriptive statements, Naoki does not come off as prideful or boasting; if anything, she seems somewhat uncomfortable stating as much aloud. \u201cThough I am well-liked by the public, and have many good friends,\u201d she nods slightly toward Torrin Delmirev, \u201cthere are those that would wish harm upon me. So much is an eventuality, assured by the scale on which I now operate. \u2026 And there are securities and guards, certainly.\u201dRunning a finger along one of the glowing runes inset into the table's surface, she continues, \u201cInnumerable wards and spells are in place in locations I frequent, I have a trusted personal guard, and I do not mean to insinuate that the Citadel Guard are incompetent.\u201d\u201cBut. My guard is but a single woman, and as prone to mistakes as any other human. It is not the task of the Citadel Guard to ensure the safety of my lover- as she does not live inside The Citadel, and magic is fallible and vulnerable to tampering. As such, I feel the need for a new force, dedicated primarily to my safety, and functioning also to protect highly ranking figures of the Isran government and other figures of importance.\u201dNodding slightly, Naoki signals the end of what she has to say, with the unsaid continuation, \u201cThat\u2019s where you come in.\u201d", "1494895401000": "Shaking her head, Naoki indicates the negative but does not elaborate further, as a sharply dressed member of the Midnight Sun wait staff is approaching, carrying two trays. Moving one hand to the underside of the table, Naoki spends a half moment and disengages the runic charms that would prevent the waiter from entering before motioning him forward.The first tray he places before Torrin Delmirev . Upon it is a bowl containing the fritta previously discussed - which seems to be just as described, as well as the proper cutlery, and the Dragon\u2019s Roar. It is served in a tall, clear glass, and seems as liquid fire- red, yellow and orange within the cup putting on a rather good impression of crackling flames. The second tray is smaller and appears to be arranged with hors d'oeuvres. They are all of the same, of bread, a piece of meat, what would seem to be a cheese, and an appropriately sized bit of lettuce all arranged on a small stick as if they were about fifteen petite kebabs. This tray, the waiter places before Naoki, before offering a single word and departing. Naoki spends a half moment to toggle the runes back on before continuing, \u201cThe city has The Isran Guard, it has the combined arms of the Free States, and it has a significant number of highly skilled and mighty warriors and magic-wielders, among other things. Isra is well cared for; I am responsible for the continued existence of the city, and I am not creating a force to serve the city\u2019s interests.\u201d\u201cSuch a force would require a leader solely loyal to me,\u201d Naoki states. Throughout and following her statement, she maintains calm eye contact and the level of professionalism one might expect.", "1495408215000": "May 20, 2017 10:28:00 GMT -8 Torrin Delmirev said:\"I understand,\" was his only answer as he eyed the food. Torrin piled an appropriate amount of everything onto a single plate, not seeming to care what mixed or touched in the process of doing so.\"I have no issues being in charge of a force loyal to you rather than the city, and I am assuming if we are here then you have considered and accepted the likely political repercussions of having such a force. I like this city, and I respect what you have done with it, but who pays my salary only matters in so far as it determines the loyalty of me and my boys, but unlike less...scrupulous mercenary companies, we honor a contract no matter how much is offered to change it.\"While listening, Lady Naoki polishes off one of her hors d'oeuvres. After wiping her face, she nods once in acknowledgment, before speaking to clarify further. \u201cI am not necessarily talking to you in the context of intending to hire your mercenary company. I mean to speak primarily to you as an individual, with an offer of a job as - technically - a part of Isra\u2019s army. As the leader of a Legion independent from the command structure of the military, obliged only to my personal authority.\u201d\u201cAccepting my offer,\u201d Naoki continues rather bluntly, \u201cwould mean ending your current occupation as a mercenary.\u201d\u201cIf you do, I would be quite willing to consider any candidates you might suggest, but I cannot promise to employ anyone else at this moment. It is of the utmost importance to me that I can trust the members of this force with those things I value most. As such, in addition to the other requirements it is my intention to speak with any applicants deemed worthy myself, and only allow those who pass my judgment. I am aware that this will not result in a large force immediately, and will disclude some otherwise perfectly capable candidates, but this is the course of action I have chosen.\u201d", "1496170640000": "\u201cExcellent. I am pleased to have your support. \u2026 Don\u2019t think of it as the army, however. An army, perhaps, but not a component of the army.\u201d Pausing for a moment, Naoki had another of her miniature kebabs.  \u201cBut! On to the details. This group has yet to be formed in any substantial capacity yet- all that I have done so far has been to set resources aside and earmark potential candidates. Most of the details will be worked out between you and me, but allow me to elaborate on what I have established thus far\u2026\u201d Over the course of the next hour or so, Naoki and Torrin discuss various specific aspects of the group that will become known as The Imperial Sentinels. As their discussion concludes, Naoki places her empty mug down on the table for the third time. \u201cI believe that to be all we have to discuss as far as business is concerned for the time being. Again, I\u2019m pleased that you\u2019ve chosen to accept my offer; I believe this will be a mutually beneficial arrangement.\u201d  Extending her arm across the table, Naoki offers Torrin her hand, presumably to shake. ", "1497610736000": "Knowing nothing of dragonborn traditions, Lady Naoki follows through with the handshake and observes with polite interest. But she has her own 'traditions' when it comes to sealing deals. Nodding amicably, she acknowledges his statement and subtly shifts away from the professional toward more playful, suggestive tones as she opens a new line of discussion. \u201cIf I might, have you already made arrangements for tonight? If not, I would insist upon showing you a room here at The Sun. The beds here, you\u2019ll find, are most comfortable.\u201d Holding his eye and giving Torrin one of her winning smiles, Naoki slides her hand across the smooth tabletop to brush her fingers ever-so-delicately across the runes, slowly disabling all but the ward of privacy. ", "1498528152000": "Leaning backward in her chair, Lady Naoki fixes Torrin with a look, one eyebrow raised. She\u2019s unsure whether he\u2019s flawlessly maintaining his professional attitude or just hasn\u2019t caught on. Might be both. Regardless, that\u2019s the answer she was looking for. Rising from her seat, Naoki makes a grand, sweeping gesture toward the other side of the building. \u201cLeadership in my case is in large part forming and maintaining relationships. With foreign leaders, with the soldiers of the army, local politicians, my lieutenants, and especially with people like you.\u201d (Semi) subtly, Naoki casts a glance toward the front of Torrin\u2019s pants. Leaving the remainder of her meal and her mug there on the table, she strikes a path from their table in the back toward the double doors that lead into the inn portion of the building. Those patrons standing in the way move swiftly, not wishing to create an issue with The Empress and an eight-foot tall dragonborn. Through the double doors, Cecil the innkeeper sits on his stool behind the counter.  Naoki greets him by name as she proceeds around the side of the desk to stand behind Cecil, in front of the key rack. Putting a hand to her chin, she considers the keys that are present- the rooms that are unoccupied. After a moment she selects one: the number twelve key, and daintily plucks it from its hook before turning to leave. On the way out, she thanks Cecil, and accidentally-or-not trails her tail along his back as she passes. Cecil, for his part, seems somewhat amused by the whole exchange, though he doesn\u2019t express as much audibly. Looking from Naoki\u2019s retreating behind to Torrin, he smirks, and offers Torrin a thumbs up before taking his pen to the ledger before him and marking room twelve as \u201cOccupied.\u201d After checking to ensure that Torrin is behind her, Naoki leads the way up the stairs. She twirls the key on its chain as she turns immediately to the right at the top of the stairs, and a few paces more to a door bearing a plaque reading, \u201c12.\u201d As Naoki unlocks the door, Torrin would be able to see that the key is a finely made, an elegant thing bearing a gemstone; a gem that seems identical to one embedded into the surface of the lock.i.imgur.com/KaknLW1.jpg In any case, the door opens, and Naoki proceeds inside. The room is a large one, specifically, intended for guests that wouldn\u2019t easily fit into furniture designed for humans. The ceiling, for instance, is significantly further overhead than one might expect. But perhaps the most obvious thing is the bed, which is much longer and wider than any other bed for two might be. Turning around to face Torrin, Naoki speaks and steps backward. \u201cHave this room for as long as you need, until something more permanent can be arranged. For anything to do with it, you can speak to Cecil down there.\u201d She gestures with one hand in the direction of the stairs as she uses the other to place the room\u2019s key atop the bedside table. However, she doesn\u2019t stop backing up there and indeed continues all the way up to seat herself on the edge of the bed. It may at this point become relevant to know that this evening, Naoki is wearing one of her sweater dresses with a pair of sandals that have straps up her ankles. Eyeing Torrin with a smirk, she draws one foot partway up and begins to untie the straps on her shoe.", "1499438956000": "Watching Torrin arrive at his realization as her shoes come off, Naoki continues to smirk. He says that she thinks, he says that but she knows full well that even had he declined her business offer, she still would have invited him up here. He doesn\u2019t need to know that, though. \u201cA perk?\u201d Naoki repeats mockingly. She scoffs as her sweater drapes itself over the footboard. (Though she supposes he\u2019s not wrong, they do have a bit of perk.)\u201cView it as you like,\u201d she continues, turning to give him some good angles from which to choose, \u201cBut I intend this to be your first service to me. In which I hope not to be left wanting.\" Leaving the other half of undressing incomplete, Naoki reclines into the bed. Though not a small woman, Naoki seems as such in comparison to the bed, as large as it is. She appears to revel in it and indeed prefers it, stretching some as she waits.", "1501673801000": "\u201cOh, I\u2019m sure.\u201d Many others have said similar things, but it would hardly be fitting to say as much.Sliding out from under his hand up onto her knees, Naoki grasps the inseam of Torrin\u2019s pants before giving a hard yank to reveal her latest toy. At the sight of it, she murmurs acknowledgment, her estimate proven correct. Placing a single finger on Torrin\u2019s chest to keep him still Naoki moves to straddle him, a voracious gleam in her eye. Torrin would end up receiving no complaints from Naoki, only commands. She evidently wasn\u2019t speaking in jest when she said that it would be Torrin doing the servicing, though it is a two-way street, so to speak. Though she deigns not to mention it explicitly, Torrin may notice the tattoo on Naoki\u2019s inner thigh glowing and the unnatural warmness that seems to accompany it. Due in part to the lustful energies at work, Torrin would have little difficulty continuing to satisfy her desires several times over the course of the night.After a brief nap and a few enthusiastic encores, Naoki sees it fit to depart, leaving Torrin to what she suspects will be a very sound sleep.The following morning - or afternoon, Torrin would find outside his door a small pile of crates. Within, bottles of Silverleaf wine packed for travel, almost 40 in all.", "1512269825000": "Empress Naoki enters The Midnight Sun by way of magic, which drops her unceremoniously onto the floor. In the dark. A gesture lights the candles as Naoki gets to her feet, mumbling something rude about her method of transport.Standing, she\u2019s greeted by the sight of her old office and pauses for a moment as the memories come rushing back. That\u2019s her desk, her chair, the very same rug. It\u2019s been at least a few years since Naoki was last in here, and there\u2019s a certain amount of nostalgia to be had.Trailing her fingers through the layer of dust, Naoki idly winds her way around to the back of the desk and sits, for the view she once had so often. Though she took the essential items, many of her possessions have sat here the whole time, leading the office to look more or less just as it always was, minus the dust.Her memories of The Midnight Sun are primarily pleasant. This desk, these chairs, this is where she first met so many people. For the time that she was here, Naoki made many friends -- many of whom she retains, and amassed considerable wealth. In hindsight,  it seems like a good chapter, Naoki thinks, a stepping stone. The skills she developed here in business and economic affairs eventually served as one of the primary qualifications behind her being appointed Minister of Finance.When she was elected Lady of Isra, Naoki made a deal with one of her existing business partners, Mr. @calico. By the terms of the agreement, Naoki retained ownership of The Sun but handed the management role to him, as well as a portion of the revenue stream in payment. In the years since then, The Sun has continued to be a wildly profitable business for them both, though not quite as much as it once was, and not quite with as much excitement, as Naoki took her moving and shaking to The Citadel.Passing through the door behind her chair, Naoki tenses as she realizes what\u2019s in this room -- the bedroom. The bedroom in which she hid during that first, terrible crisis, and more significantly, the bedroom she once shared with Artemis. ...For a few moments, Naoki is still, her expression blank as her eyes sweep the room over.\u2026She bites her tongue and steels her expression to keep from sobbing. Hand still on the doorknob, she looks the room over again angrily, searching for some item to take and leave with, to justify her peeking. But there isn\u2019t anything of value, sentimental or otherwise, that she can reasonably justify taking. She exits, nearly slamming the door behind her with an irritable huff. She takes a deep breath. \u2026 And another. \u2026 And it\u2019s time to move on to the next thing. She came here- to The Sun, not the office, for a reason, and it\u2019s time to Do the Things, with the People. As she Does, as the Leader.Another gesture returns darkness to the room as Naoki exits out into the hallway, re-locking the door behind herself and not looking back.Later\u2026 Empress Naoki sits in her favorite booth in the corner, idly fiddling with a gemstone. With a small measure of disgust, she realizes the seat is still warm. A group had been sitting here, but convincing them to move was not difficult, she found. But, ew.Pushing the matter from her mind, Naoki considers her upcoming meeting with Jun. It\u2019s been a bit of a while since they\u2019ve properly sat down to talk, and Naoki has a few items she intends to bring up, though she doesn\u2019t want to make this seem like a business meeting.What it is is Naoki making good on a deal she made wherein Jun would treat Naoki to lunch. When the lunch is free, and Naoki chooses the time and place, it\u2019s not really that, she supposes, but the result is effectively the same, and she isn\u2019t one to get caught in semantics in situations like these.She chose The Sun as the location for a few reasons, the primary thought being that of all the places where they potentially could get lunch, The Sun is the only one to be unrelated to business, have good food, and not be The Eclipse\u2026 Which she really wouldn\u2019t want to visit with Jun in any given case, even though that topic has since been put to rest. So here she sits! In in a booth in a back corner of the bar, rolling a small gemstone between her fingers, an eye out for Jun of the Celadine, sits Naoki.", "1512278269000": "\u201cDo they still serve Darkdew Chocolate Cake.\u201d Naoki repeats the question, staring blankly at Jun for a moment.\u201cI don\u2019t know, but they will today,\" she says, grinning.fillip!  Naoki snaps her fingers and gestures to a nearby waiter.He only realizes who\u2019s sitting at the table once he\u2019s arrived, and makes a small \u201coh.\u201d sound as he does, turning a shade whiter then a shade redder. He hesitates, unsure what to say, but thankfully, Naoki preempts him. \u201cWe\u2019d like a Darkdew Chocolate Cake -- a largish one, and we\u2019d like it to be prepared by one of the senior chefs. We\u2019d like two plates -- with utensils, and two cake knives.\u201d \u201cTo slide one underneath,\u201d she explains, miming the action to Jun.Naoki waits until he\u2019s finished writing to continue, \u201cAnd for me, a Red Blizzard -- from Bertie.\u201dA gesture in the direction of the bar.Nodding vigorously, he takes that down, focusing the entirety of his attention on his notepad. His job is only to transfer information and items, not to know what these secret menu items are. Naoki seems to be finished, so he looks toward Jun promptingly, far past his ability to articulate. ", "1512372093000": "Naoki shrugs. It\u2019s all the same to her.The waiter nods some more and looks to Naoki for permission to leave, doing his best not to do anything stupid for the remainder of this interaction. She grants it, waving him away. After he\u2019s scuttled off, Naoki turns to face Jun and is pleased to hear that she\u2019s doing better. In regards to the mission, she hasn\u2019t, actually, but doubts that Jun would like to talk about it, and doesn't intend to bring it up. Though the mention of an \u2018apprentice\u2019 catches Naoki's ear, and she resolves to ask about that later.\u201cIt does,\u201d Naoki agrees, nodding. The reasons differ between them, but even so. For a few moments, Naoki lets the silence hang, looking out toward the bar and its patrons, listening to the familiar sounds of indistinct conversation and clinking glasses.\u201cYuletide is coming up,\u201d she continues cheerily. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a big celebration this year, hopefully almost as much as Prospernailia was, and my first time celebrating it, as well. \u2026 I\u2019m quite enjoying preparing gifts for everyone, and I\u2019m looking forward to giving them. Is it -- is Yuletide, traditionally celebrated in The Expanse, or\u2026?\u201d Naoki trails off, one eyebrow raised in question. ", "1512579035000": "Resting her elbow on the table and chin in her palm, Naoki listens with rapt attention. The Tiller celebrations sound\u2026 very much like the sort of celebrations she assumes Tillers might have. Which isn\u2019t saying much, she supposes, but having visited and knowing what she does, it\u2019s easy to imagine the sorts of things Jun describes. In response to Jun's question, Naoki lifts her head and uses that arm to make a noncommittal sort of shrug.\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s an expectation for you to, or for anyone in particular to. The celebration of Yuletide here -- it\u2019s based primarily on old, half-forgotten pre-cataclysm traditions. Hasn\u2019t been celebrated by anyone much for aaaages and ages. Yuletide in Isra for these first few years will be exactly what we make it out to be, so I think expectations are more or less nonexistent.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m giving gifts because there\u2019s a plausible reason to do so and I enjoy doing it. It\u2019s an opportunity to express kindness, affection and all that, and it\u2019s an opportunity for me to spoil Alden\u2019s kids rotten.\u201d Naoki smirks. \u201cSince I can, why wouldn\u2019t I? You know me.\u201dJust then, the waiter returns with their drinks. Jun\u2019s coffee comes in a delicate little mug imported from Katashima -- saucer and all, and Naoki\u2019s blizzard comes in a tall, straight glass which serves to showcase the beverage\u2019s gentle undulation.Naoki thanks him, and he promptly excuses himself. Before continuing, Naoki takes the top off her drink, and as she is, begins to brandish one finger at Jun. It looks like Naoki has an idea to share. She sets the glass down, \u201cI have a gentleman with an office over at The Eclipse who handles Acquisition for me. I give him a list, preferably as detailed as possible. He makes use of contacts and resources appropriately on my behalf and comes back to me with the items, whatever they may be. You should consider him as a resource you\u2019re free to use -- should you decide to give any gifts.\u201d", "1512702524000": "More nodding on Naoki\u2019s part. Alden is difficult to shop for, as is befitting a father of his stature, she supposes. In considering her gift for him, a thought arises that he probably won't find it as agreeable a gift as she might like. Though of course, he'll say he finds it well to be polite. Maybe she should get him something else -- something more. Hmm. Naoki files this thought appropriately.\u201cIt\u2019s better when it\u2019s a surprise,\" she says, \"but that\u2019s not one of the things that makes a good gift, necessarily, I think. Sometimes they know what they want better than you do, so my policy is to take hints happily.\u201dRaising the glass to her lips, Naoki takes a long sip, maintaining eye contact with Jun for the duration. Only when she sets it aside does she look away, searching for a napkin to wipe her face.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit like drinking a gust of winter air. ... But with peppermint! 'Red.'\u201d An indescribable gesture; that\u2019s what the prefix means. \u201cIt\u2019s cold in the same way that peppers are hot -- which is, not really. Not in the usual way the word is used. It doesn\u2019t chill, but sort of feeels like it should, and that\u2019s why I like it.\u201dPicking said glass back up, Naoki makes a mock-toast and nods slightly at Jun before going for another drink.", "1512884530000": "\u201cYou\u2019ve seen the log?\u201d Naoki jerks one thumb over her shoulder and continues on the assumption that Jun\u2019s seen the log -- there\u2019s no way she hasn\u2019t.\u201cI\u2019m going to begin the festival with a little ceremony, wherein I\u2019ll say a few words and set the log aflame. It\u2019ll burn symbolically for the duration of the festivities.\u201d\u201cBut Yuletide\u2026\u201d She hesitates, searching for the right words. \u201cIt won\u2019t be a festival in quite the same sense Prospernailia was a festival, with the games and events. Too cold for that sort of thing. No, Yuletide will be something celebrated primarily indoors, on a more personal level, I think.\u201d\u201cThe \u2018big thing,\u2019 so to speak, the outside thing, for me slash the government, is going to be the handouts.  You know how I have that bit, where I go, \u2018No one starves in Isra\u2019 and make a big deal of the welfare programs, making myself out to be soo benevolent?\u201d\u201cYes, well -- \u201d She takes a drink. \u201cFor Yuletide, I\u2019ll be taking that to its realistic maximum. Throughout the city -- spaced as to avoid crowding. Hopefully. We\u2019ll be handing out food. Good food, too. There are obviously logistical limits involved, but I\u2019ve seen to it such that it ought to at least be good, if perhaps a bit plain.\u201d\u201cAlong with that, many places -- taverns and such, will be doing something for the event. The Sun here will be serving special drinks,\u201d Naoki gestures to her glass. \u201cAnd some of the bars will be running specials. Reduced costs on rounds of drinks, things like that. I expect people will be spending more time with their peers or loved ones than out in the snow, though.\u201d\u201cI intend to personally deliver my gifts, where possible, and Kate\u2019s reserved two days on my schedule -- you won\u2019t be seeing either of us the 19th or 20th. \u2026 There will also be a feast at the end, at the Keep Hall. You\u2019re invited to that. It\u2019s going to be a potluck, so bring something good.\u201dThe feast seems like something of an afterthought, judging by the tone of her voice as Naoki mentioned it. And though it may be as far as her priorities are concerned, it will be a fairly large event regardless.\u201cBut~\u00a0 !\u201d Naoki taps the table twice and snap-points at Jun. \u201cYou know what I\u2019d like to see? \u2026 Some of those Land Tiller things you mentioned. Specifically, I think you could put on one helluva lightshow.\u201dThough Naoki didn\u2019t explicitly ask a question, it seems like she expects an answer. She sits leaning forward, her head tilted a bit to one side. Behind her, it sounds as if her tail is restless, smacking into things every so often.", "1513168931000": "Listening, Naoki smiles slightly, pleased to have gotten the reaction she did. She takes another sip of her beverage as Jun\u2019s talking and swirls the remainder of her drink around in the glass until she\u2019s finished. \u201cI\u2019m glad to hear it \u2014 glad to have your help, as always. There\u2019s a meeting scheduled this evening where I\u2019ll be meeting with my project managers; that will be a good place to discuss the specifics. Hold on to your ideas until then.\u201d\u201cI have another, somewhat similar topic I\u2019d like to broach -- that doesn\u2019t necessarily have to do with Yuletide. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll recall a few years past, we had a tournament? The Second Annual Grand? It was fine, for what it was, but too large an event.\u201d Naoki\u2019s free hand has entered the conversation, gesturing this way and that as she speaks.\u201cIt was geared toward identifying potential Sun Marshals and hosting a tournament for the sake of the sport. In those regards, it did well \u2014 well enough to justify itself, but what I have in mind would have another focus. An apt name might be exhibition matches.\u201d A pause as Naoki drinks.\u201cI think it would be an amazing spectacle to see Isra\u2019s most powerful heroes and greatest champions face off in the arena. Entertainment for the spectators, practice and prizes for the combatants, and a display of power to all those who would fancy themselves, enemies. I have high hopes, and I would like to know what you think \u2014 if you would be amenable to participating in such an event.\u201d", "1514164837000": "\u201cNot a tournament \u2014 I\u2019m not planning on hosting any more tournaments. \u2014 But as soon as possible. The first step was to ask you, the next will be to find a suitable opponent. Then I\u2019ll get things set up and schedule the match. If it goes well, we\u2019ll do more.\u201dIt seems Naoki missed Jun\u2019s muttered comment, or if she did, she doesn't have a chance to address it, as she spots their waiter approaching. The table is silent when he arrives with his cart. Prime among the items thereupon is a large, exceedingly stereotypical covered serving platter. In a practiced motion, he places the tray in the center of the table. Removing the lid, he reveals what lies below: the requested Darkdew Chocolate Cake.And what a cake it is. The claim could easily be made that there is as much artistic potential to be found in the preparation of a baked good as the painting of a canvas \u2014 and this cake is a masterpiece.How the kitchen acquired such a thing is anyone\u2019s guess. Is it still on the menu? Did they send someone to the bazaar for the ingredients, or did they have them brought in via a portal from hundreds of miles abroad? Was dark magic involved? Did one of the kitchen staff sign away their soul to a demon in exchange for this cake? Naoki may never know. She takes stock of their food and doesn\u2019t find anything amiss.Along with the cake come two plates, two sets of silverware, two cake knives, and Jun\u2019s sandwich. The waiter lingers, anticipating requests.", "1514898363000": "\u201cExhibiting,\u201d Naoki offers. \u201cAs in the verb \u2018exhibit.\u2019 So named as they are geared toward exhibiting, or showing off, the combatants and the battle, more so than competition for its own sake \u2014 like the tournament.\u201d She nods her thanks as she accepts the slice from Jun.Exercising the utmost care, Naoki lifts her cherry by the stem to set it on the edge of her plate, saving it for last. The waiter nods and mumbles some affirmative mumbles before leaving.\u201cBut that\u2019s a good question. I have access to a relatively large number of strong fighters, but that isn\u2019t the only thing that matters in selection. One must also bear in mind the publicity that will come with participating and the effect that will have on both public perception and the individual\u2019s personal life. For someone who lives and works here in the city, sudden public scrutiny may turn out to be a bit of an issue,\u201d she continues, taking her knife to the cake. \u201cSome otherwise suitable options fight in\u2026 \u2018unentertaining\u2019 ways, let\u2019s say, or wouldn\u2019t, in facing you, make for a very exciting match.\u201d A few names, in particular, come to mind, but Naoki doesn\u2019t elaborate further.\u201cI\u2019m going to send feelers wider, and there\u2019s always the option of a beast of some sort. ... But if you\u2019d like my guess, I think it will probably end up being either, A, someone from The Enclave, B, a Sun Marshal, or C, one of our mutual, miscellaneous acquaintances.\u201d Naoki raises a forkful of cake to her mouth but pauses mid-motion to add, \u201cMaybe I could get a demon lord...\u201d Wrinkling her brow ever-so-slightly, she seems to be seriously considering the idea as she continues into the cake. As she is, the waiter returns to deliver Jun\u2019s coffee.", "1545185208000": "The Empress\u2019s Carriage approaches the Guard barricade, escorted by mounted Sentinels. It stops a short distance away, pulling over to one side of the avenue. Within, a very unhappy Empress is roused to full wakefulness, blinking several times as she reorients herself. What ought to have been a pleasant carriage ride back to Isra with Kate has been sombered by the news they received this morning, \u201cThere has been an explosion at The Midnight Sun.\u201d An explosion large enough to close its doors and, evidently, warrant alerting The Empress with the utmost urgency. The last time The Midnight Sun was closed for business was the incident with the archangel years and years ago. Much of the bar was burnt beyond repair by a self-titled \u201carchangel\u201d who took it upon himself to enact justice on what he viewed as a den of sin. Naoki\u2019s memories of that night are none too pleasant, but it was the beginning of her relationship with Kate, and the repairs resulted in many improvements to the establishment.It would be unreasonable to hope that this incident will lead to anything nearly as good, so Naoki is instead hoping that this is, in reality, a small incident that has been overblown. However, with this many officers of The Guard present, that doesn\u2019t seem likely. Naoki wordlessly nudges Kate to communicate the fact that they\u2019ve arrived at their destination. ", "1545545442000": "For a few moments, Naoki quietly sits in the carriage, warm and largely content. She wouldn\u2019t like to go out there any more than Kate would, and technically, no one can force her to. She could turn this carriage around and go home, but she knows that she won\u2019t be able to rest without seeing it.With only the most begrudging of sighs does Naoki stand and exit the carriage. Turning immediately around, she offers her hand to Kate to assist her in stepping out of the carriage but doesn\u2019t let go afterward. The Empress waves aside the nearest Guardsman with her free hand and proceeds through the barricade. The view is better on the other side, allowing her to see more clearly the damages, such as they are. The building is far from leveled, but a great big chunk is missing out of the front, and even as she watches a piece of paneling falls to the ground, leaving the beams behind bare, like skin sloughing off the bone. To see this place, The Midnight Sun, her beginning, the setting of so many memories, mutilated in such a way\u2026 It\u2019s saddening, to say the least, though The Empress keeps her expression under control. Squeezing Kate\u2019s hand, Naoki finds herself all the more grateful for her presence. After losing Artemis, after losing Kate, under the ever-increasing pressures associated with leadership, this probably would have been the last straw to break her, but with Kate here it seems manageable. Naoki makes a mental note to say something to that extent later.Deliberately ignoring the bodies for the time being, Naoki looks toward the building and the activity around it. There she sees \u2014 why, that must be Iulia in the Inspector uniform, with her braid and her beret, looking very small next to someone who must be with the Fire Department. The Empress is curious to know how Iulia in doing in her new position, but she\u2019s working and Naoki is herself working on reconciling her thoughts, so she remains where she is, lingering near the barricade, hopefully out of everyone\u2019s way.", "1546325492000": "\u201cIt is,\u201d Naoki agrees. For a long few moments, she remains just as she is. Her vision gradually pans over to where the bodies have been laid, and where the field hospital has been set up. Bodies, in and of themselves, are far from the worst thing The Empress has seen, but the idea of those bodies belonging to her citizens, in her city, behind her walls, in her bar\u2026 That\u2019s more difficult to stomach. Though she knows the circumstances that brought about their deaths were beyond her control, it still feels like a personal failure to have protected them. At some point, there must have been something she could have done. Could more stringent regulations on volatile alchemical ingredients have prevented this? Something could have. With the near-absolute level of control The Empress has over both Isra and The Midnight Sun, there was, at some point, some action she could have taken to prevent this tragedy. But she didn\u2019t, and now they\u2019re dead. This is enough to spur her to action. \u201cI want to know why it happened.\u201dWith this goal in mind, The Empress starts for the building with the intention to do some looking herself. Mindful of the dangers still present, she has no intention to enter the building, but it isn\u2019t as if there\u2019s a wall that would prevent her from looking in. Taking a route that avoids both the field hospital and the bodies, Naoki leads Kate to the largest pile of rubble. A mixture of bricks, structural beams, broken furniture, and smaller things such as mugs and cutlery, stacked into a pile by the rescuers to get it out of the way. Naoki puts her free hand to her chin. The flames that followed the blast have charred much of it. She\u2019s able to mentally place some of it, a particular door, half of what used to be a picture frame on the far wall\u2026 But thrown together like this, without sorting through it, it doesn't seem as if there's much to discern.Naoki looks to Kate, and then into the smoldering wreck. It seems as if there were multiple blasts; there must have been. A single explosion wouldn\u2019t necessarily have made a nice neat round hole, but a single blast powerful enough to bring down half the building would have damaged the walls more than it did, and done more damage to the second and third floors. As it stands, it looks like the second and third floors have collapsed downward and burned, but are otherwise more or less intact. Multiple blasts localized to the first floor imply either some sort of freak chain-reaction of drinks or a deliberate act of sabotage.This does not bode well, and The Empress frowns, more than she has been. She isn\u2019t sure what would have boded well, but regardless. The next step is to speak to those who were there \u2014 the first responders and hopefully, the survivors. ", "1546665118000": "For a long moment, Naoki is silent. Eventually, she\u2019s forced to admit, \u201cI don\u2019t see any other explanation.\u201d\u201cThere have been alchemical accidents in the past, but this. This is carnage, this is too much. Mixing the wrong ingredients doesn\u2019t do this.\u201d\u201cSomeone did this. Last night, someone walked into The Midnight Sun and made a decision to\u2026 To do this.\u201d Naoki\u2019s vision pans over toward the field hospital and the bodies scattered around it. The idea doesn\u2019t sit well with Naoki at all. Aside from anger toward the perpetrator, she feels some level of responsibility toward the victims. Her citizens, in her city, behind her walls, in her bar, dead. Even though she knows the circumstances about their deaths were beyond her control, it still feels like a personal failure to have protected them. At some point, there must have been something she could have done, but she didn\u2019t. Now they\u2019re dead.Turning away, The Empress huffs. Her tail lashes. Behind her, an Inquisitor enters the square, bringing with him a troupe of Magi and still more guards. They begin moving to secure the area, blocking the roads and creating a magical barrier to prevent anyone from leaving. An executive decision on the part of Grandma, Naoki supposes.

The Inquisition will be handling the investigation, and if you\u2019d like to participate in the rebuild, you should speak to the construction manager when the time comes \u2014 I\u2019m afraid you\u2019re a bit early for that.\u201d", "1546940858000": "The Empress blinks again and quirks one eyebrow, irritation momentarily replaced with uncertainty. Selene made no mention of such a talent when speaking of herself previously, and that seems like the sort of thing one would mention. Still, it\u2019s not beyond believing; being a powerful sorceress would be an appropriate secret for her to have.But it\u2019s still too early.

Naoki glances first to Kate and then around the area. The situation hasn\u2019t changed much in the past minute, much to her dismay. A sound from the direction of the field hospital prompts her to cast a troubled look toward it. Despite the heavy Guard presence, the field hospital seems understaffed. It isn\u2019t explicitly anyone\u2019s responsibility to see that the wounded are cared for, so the task has fallen to the wayside.\u201cWhy isn\u2019t The Enclave here?\u201d The Empress asks aloud, gesturing in frustration.

With how many people have shown up in unexpected places recently, she\u2019s beyond surprise. If there is an explanation, it will make itself known in time. Leaving the question unasked, The Empress nods. \u201cVery good. I\u2019ll be here.\u201d Safely off to one side, away from the rubble and the workers, The Empress leans back against a lamp pole and crosses her arms over her chest, watching the continuing operations silently.", "1548119026000": "The Empress nods in greeting to Iulia as she approaches. She maintains a mostly neutral expression as she listens to the report, but fails to keep her tail in check. It lashes sporadically, smacking the wall behind her. She isn\u2019t pleased \u2014 that much is obvious and should not come as a surprise.The implication that Iulia draws, suggesting anti-Isran or anti-Empress sentiment as the motive of the attack\u2026 It\u2019s not a very fun thought to think, but regrettably plausible. Considering it, if one wanted to attack something in an effort to wound Isra and/or irritate The Empress, The Midnight Sun is \u2014 was the best target. Everything else is guarded. The timing can\u2019t be a coincidence; it was either an attack against Isra or the work of cosmic karma, to balance out the events of the previous night.\u201c... Very good,\u201d The Empress responds, referring to The Guard\u2019s efforts. Putting a hand over her mouth, she looks away, considering. The situation, such as it is, seems to be mostly in-hand. \u201cI task The Guard: see to it that those being detained here are treated well. They are all victims or bystanders, save for maybe one. Bring in food for them, set up cots, and make sure that all of the wounded receive the treatment they need.

Though Naoki hardly gave the woman two thoughts, Kate is Upset, and that alone is enough to draw Naoki\u2019s full attention. It is convenient that Iulia excuses herself; The Empress gives her a perfunctory nod as she leaves. The woman at the barricade goes on to introduce herself as Amanda, and is then so bold as to ask Kate a question. With some idea of how upset Kate is, Naoki thinks it a poor idea for Kate to be answering questions. The Empress interjects, taking a step over to stand close at Kate\u2019s side.\u201cYou may report that some fifty people died following an explosion at The Midnight Sun in the wee hours of the morning. The explosion was deliberate and alchemical in nature. The culprit is as of yet unknown; The Office of Investigation is conducting an investigation. Useful information will be rewarded, and suspicious figures should be reported to The Guard immediately.\u201d The Empress speaks clearly such that she might be heard at a short distance, pausing between each point to allow Amanda to take note.Locking eyes with the journalist, she adds, \u201cIf I have words for the citizens of Isra, I will deliver them myself.\u201d With this, The Empress gives Amanda a very significant look, intended to convey that she ought to leave.", "1551906130000": "After a bit more standing around and overseeing, The Empress decides that she\u2019s done about as much as she can.

Clinking and shuffling noises behind her suggest she didn\u2019t come alone, but the guards remain in the hall. When the door shuts, it does so with a certain degree of finality, immediately silencing the outside noises.\u201cDixie,\u201d she says, ogling her guest, \u201cYou\u2019re early.\u201d Early, of course, in relation to when The Empress arrived, as opposed to any empirical time.Making her way over to the shelf, she begins to sort through the phials thereupon, squinting slightly to read the tiny labels. Over one shoulder she asks, \u201cI trust you\u2019re well?\u201d", "1537922568000": "\u201cYou weren't hurt, then. Good.\u201dThough Dixie seemed intact at the end of their last meeting, The Empress didn\u2019t really check, per se, so that\u2019s good to know. It takes only a moment longer for Naoki to find what she\u2019s looking for. Upending the phial over the bath, she shakes out several drops of what, by the smell, could only be lavender extract. The water was scented already, but not strongly enough.After replacing the phial, Naoki\u2019s garments come off quickly in comparison and find their way onto the shelf, neatly folded. Then it\u2019s into the bath, all at once, feet first. A shudder works its way down her tail, and she sighs, adjusting to the temperature. \u201cLove hot baths,\u201d she mutters, seating herself opposite Dixie in the small basin. For a moment she sits, eyes closed, enjoying the sensation.\u201cSo,\u201d Naoki then begins, looking to Dixie and cracking her knuckles for reasons unrelated. \u201cWhere are you living now? With Robert?\u201d", "1538012368000": "\u201cApartment?\u201d Naoki scoffs. \u201cI pay him well enough for three houses\u2014even bearing in mind his addiction.\u201dOf course, Robert doesn\u2019t have an addiction that Naoki is aware of, but it\u2019s a fun thing to say to mess with Dixie. \u201cWhat do you think of him, Robert? I\u2019m sure you\u2019re grateful and would put in a good word and all that, but aside from that. Do you enjoy the arrangement you have with him? Do you see yourself staying with him?\u201d So begin the probing questions. The Empress leans back a bit and does her best not to be distracting, which is admittedly not something she does well.", "1538060304000": "The Empress murmurs acknowledgment but isn\u2019t quite sure what Dixie is getting at, of what Robert\u2019s not-a-character-flaw might be. She doesn\u2019t inquire further, though; she isn\u2019t trying to learn about Robert.Instead, she shrugs. \u201cYou can do better than a minister\u2019s bed-warmer.\u201d\u201cYou said you wanted to follow my example.\u201d she continues, gesturing at Dixie, \u201cbut that could mean a lot of things. I've given you a taste. Do you know just what it is you\u2019re looking for, or what sort of life you\u2019d like to lead?\u201d", "1538090140000": "\u201cAh, to be in charge.\u201dSinking further into the water, The Empress puts one hand to her chin as she considers Dixie. That was what she wanted to find out, if Dixie would live an easy life in the lap of luxury, or if she has the sort of ambition that won\u2019t be satisfied living on someone else\u2019s accomplishments. Because if it was the former, Naoki has a very luxurious lap right here and Dixie has already proven she\u2019s very good at sitting in it. She could become The Empress\u2019s Bed-Warmer and live that life of luxury with no further questions. The Empress has never employed anyone\u2014never kept anyone around for explicitly such a purpose, but the idea is very appealing. Dixie is uniquely suited, and it would be terribly, terribly convenient. But there\u2019s only so much respect to be found in being anyone\u2019s plaything, and even though Dixie would be happy in such a position, it sounds like she wouldn\u2019t be fulfilled. Naoki is now considering if she cares in the slightest about that distinction.\u201cWhat would you lead?\u201d Naoki asks, one ear and one eyebrow raised. \u201cWould you see yourself in politics? Or a position like Robert\u2019s? As the leader of some manner of group, or the manager of a business, perhaps?\u201d She asks this question knowing its magnitude and hoping Dixie knows that she isn\u2019t going to become immediately beholden to whatever her answer is. ", "1538880074000": "\u201cThat\u2019s fair,\u201d Lady Naoki supposes. She knew it was a big question when she asked it. A few options come to mind, and she\u2019s about to start making suggestions when Dixie scoots closer.Naoki\u2019s mouth forms a thin line and slides over to one side of her face; that tells her everything she needs to know. She just offered Dixie the opportunity of a lifetime, and Dixie essentially passed it up entirely in favor of flirting.Dixie raises a very good point. She is young, inexperienced, and\u2014as strange as it sounds to say, naive. Installing Dixie in a leadership position of any significance would probably not be among the best of Naoki\u2019s ideas, and bringing her into The Citadel wouldn\u2019t be good for her development. No, Naoki decides, she will leave Dixie where she is for now. \u201cI bet I can,\u201d she retorts. \u201cYou\u2019re very predictable in that way.\u201dAny effort spent on cleaning now would be pointless, so The Empress stands, putting her top half above the water. Adopting a thoughtful expression, she considered if she has any other questions that would require Dixie to be in full control of her mental faculties. She concludes that she does not, and the room begins to feel warmer. Steam begins to rise from the water, and a dull red glow can be seen below. Making a small circular motion with one finger The Empress instructs Dixie to turn around, smirking aggressively.", "1464737260000": "In an hour of the early evening, while the sun still has a few hours left before it disappears beyond the horizon, Madame Naoki strikes a path along one of Isra\u2019s primary thoroughfares. As opposed to any manner of official attire, generously cut dress, or even one of her signature sweaters, Naoki wears nothing fancier than a simple (although a bit tightly cut) white blouse, and a pair of black trousers. However, even more uncharacteristic than this relatively simple attire is what she carries in her left hand. A bow. A recurve bow, at that, already string. A weapon. It\u2019s been a long while since Naoki last held a weapon, and the first time ever she has without fully intending to wield it lethally in defense. Even among her closest companions, many would be hard pressed to name an occasion on which Naoki had taken up a weapon firsthand. But a bow would be nothing without arrows, and so a quiver filled with arrows is strapped to her right thigh, the arrows jostling around some as she moves along down the road.As part of a series of measures implemented to prevent government officials from working themselves into the ground, Naoki has found that she has already worked the maximum number of hours this week, and is technically not supposed to continue acting in an official capacity as Lady in regular circumstances. That\u2019s not to say that she couldn\u2019t, persay, but hey. She\u2019s not one to defy such an excellent excuse to leave the office. It seems as if half of this \u2018leadership\u2019 business is simply reading, writing, and signing official documents, and any excuse to stop doing that for a short while is a welcome one. Unfortunately, as it so happens, Kate has been absolutely swamped with work lately, so spending time with her was forcibly removed from the table. Figuring that it may be enjoyable to mix things up a bit from her standard leisure time activity of reading, Naoki thought it woth some of her time to continue practicing her bowmanship. Archery being something she had wanted to take up for years, but never quite had the funds or time to support. Until today! So along she goes, a relaxed sort of look on her face, tail bobbing idly with each step, and  Artemis just behind and to her right, down one of Isra\u2019s thoroughfares, presumably to find something to shoot. ", "1464905865000": "As the heady aromas wafts back into Naoki\u2019s path, she instinctively exhales sharply in attempt to prevent the likely sour-smelling scent away. Yet, that\u2019s not quite enough to keep all of the the reddish fumes from snaking their way up into her nose. And, funnily enough\u2026 the smell isn\u2019t that bad. Not bad at all, actually. A little shiver involuntarily runs its way down her body, starting at the top and finishing with a quick lash of her tail. Whatever that is, it\u2019s pretty potent. And Artemis notices too. Casting an inquisitive eye at the figure before her, the most pronounced visible feature are the wings.That is one rather pleasant feature of wings, Naoki supposes. One can usually discern the type of creature by wing alone, what with how many types of wings there are. These ones, gracing the back of the individual before her, they resemble Maelik\u2019s; so it would stand to reason that the creature before her is either draconic, demonic, or some mixture of the two, perhaps. Interesting. The remainder of what features are visible from behind are noted and filed away in Naoki\u2019s reservoir of memories, but are not of any immediate consequence, and not given more than a passing thought.However, instead of pulling to the back and to the side as Artemis suggests, Naoki ups her pace slightly while moving to the left, aiming to match pace, positioning herself to @incubusfun's left, with Artemis between them and slightly behind Naoki. This would still remove her from the path of the smoke, and assuming that she is allowed to achieve this position, she casts one eye in his direction, ever so casually, aiming to get a better look at whoever it is, smoking such a thing on the street, and daring to to allow his secondhand smoke to befoul her nose. ", "1464971789000": "Noticing where his eyes are headed, Naoki reciprocates the ogling, taking a moment to look part Artemis and note of the features of the figure walking to her right. Short horns on the head. Tall. A solid five inches taller than she is, not counting ears or horns. Well dressed. And awfully handsome. Her gaze can\u2019t help but linger for a moment each on the curvature of his face, and then the front of his breeches. Oho. A lust demon. As he speaks his bit, she glances back up to his face, just long enough to acknowledge him, before continuing to watch the road ahead. \u201cMy pretty robin.\u201d That\u2019s a new one. However, that eye contact is quite enough. As she continues down the road, Naoki\u2019s gaits shift subtly, yet perceptibly. More hip movement, more pronounced and deliberate steps, and the introduction of of a rhythmic tail swinging beyond its natural sway. To match, her thoughts shift from the mundane, what she needs to do before going to bed, what\u2019s on the list for tomorrow, to the more\u2026 exotic timesink of envisioning the individual standing to her right in all sorts of interesting poses. However, her self control is unmatched, and beyond the manner in which her gait shifts, and the tone of sultriness added to her voice as she responds, Naoki does not outwardly display any indication of being \u2018charmed\u2019 or what sorts of images she\u2019s envisioning. \u201cPracticed my archery today. Walking home now. Yourself?\u201dThough she doesn\u2019t actually have much of a doubt regarding the circumstances that brought this winged man out into the streets tonight, (it isn\u2019t as if lust demons have that many hobbies) she figures it polite to ask, and is somewhat curious to see what sort of individual he is. Simply because an individual is motivated by only the single driving force doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that they\u2019re quite like all others who are motivated similarly. Maelik is a testament to that. It could be such that this particular lust demon is intellectually inclined, or has some manner of unique characteristic that gives him more depth than your standard incubus.", "1465268730000": "\u201cThat\u2019s what I figure, yes. Promotes good posture, upper arm strength, and other such more generally applicable skills\u2026 An elegant sport, to be sure, and more practical than many others.\u201d As his knuckles brush against her upper arm, Naoki trembles ever so slightly, both physically and mentally, as that oh-so-familiar feeling sets in. Her analysis was correct. Definitely some manner of lust demon -  one that, she decides, she is going to have her way with.Dropping the volume of her voice slightly, she continues, \u201cNot quite my favorite hobby, though. On that point, I suspect that you and I may just have similar views.\u201dAdjusting her gait to step slightly closer to Praxnihr, Naoki\u2019s extra appendage snakes its way behind his back and around his right side to trace a line from his navel down before retreating swiftly, again assuming its default position bobbing along behind her shapely bottom. However, she herself does not draw back, remaining within arm\u2019s reach of the well dressed incubus. While one ear remains trained forward, the other focuses on Praxnihr. Her eyes, unable to operate independently in the same way, opt to continue casting lingering glances in his direction.\u201cWere you planning on introducing yourself? Or do I have to take the initiative in that department as well?\u201d", "1465447364000": "As the crimson smoke again approaches her nose, Naoki huffs, seemingly in response to Phraxnir\u2019s statement, but actually in an attempt to blow his smoke away. Tricky sort of demon, he is, what with is smoke and his \u2018charming\u2019 ways. Reminds Naoki of herself. \u201cPraxnihr,\u201d she repeats his name back to him, trying out the pronunciation. Rolling it around her tongue. It certainly is a name, she supposes. She considers commenting on it, but doesn\u2019t quite know enough about demon entomology to make an informed comment. That, and there aren\u2019t any obvious lewd puns to make, so she doesn\u2019t touch it. Allowing him to plant his lips on her knuckles, she looks down on the top of his head and responds, \u201cYou\u2019ll refer to me for tonight as Madame, or Mistress.\u201d\u201cNow. I\u2019ve just decided, before heading home, I\u2019ll be paying a visit to The Moonlight Eclipse. Have something to eat, I figure. You should accompany me.\u201dWith that, a sultry sort of wink and altogether more tail swishing than is necessary, Naoki makes an abrupt right turn, breaking off the main thoroughfare to take a side road toward The Citadel, and The Moonlight Eclipse. ", "1465536391000": "With a not quite harsh, but unquestionably firm arm movement, Naoki rejects Praxnihr\u2019s offered arm. He hasn\u2019t earned the right to walk arm-in-arm with her. Few have. And this one has yet to even prove his skill. He would not be permitted any touches of familiarity tonight. With @artemisin her customary position slightly behind and to the right, and @incubusfun following closley behind, Madame Naoki makes her way to The Moonlight Eclipse. ", "1445129408000": "The day after Hasdrubal\u2019s funeral, some time in the midmorning. The sun is just peeking above the rooftops of the homes and small businesses that line the street on which Green\u2019s Greens is located. A hint of yesterday\u2019s rain remains in small puddles dotting the road.A pair of feminine figures make their way down the street, one slightly behind and to the right of the other. The leading figure is wearing a blue, geometrically patterned sundress, with a gray, knitted shawl wrapped around her waist. A wide brimmed, woven straw hat is worn low, hiding her face. The hat sits uncomfortably on her head, and she adjusts it with her left hand as she walks. Her right hand is held gingerly at her side, wrapped in white medical bandaging. Under her arm, she carries a parcel. Bigger than a breadbox, smaller than a wagon wheel, it is wrapped in brown paper and tied shut with twine. The duo approach Green\u2019s Greens. The leading figure raises her hat, a set of amber eyes check the sign on the door. She nods. This was the place. Raising her left hand once more, she uses the back of her knuckles to rhythmically knock on the door.", "1445242265000": "As Madame Naoki steps over the threshold to enter the shop, a soft smile spreads across her face. People react to Madame Naoki in different ways. Most bow, or nod, show respect before addressing her formally, and politely say what the have to say. On the street, where some might now know her, they might ogle her, perhaps make some offhand remark. But this was new. Nobody blushed, or got flustered to such a degree. It was a wholly different type of respect than the sort Naoki was used to; and she kinda liked it. Once inside, Madame Naoki doffs her hat, revealing her ears, and takes a moment to look around. So this was Kate\u2019s passion. Naoki had never seen quite so many varieties of plants and greenery in one place. Everywhere she turned, more and more types and colors. Her mouth gapes slightly as she gazes around. Some of the plants she recognized; a small pot of basil, a rose bush. Others, she couldn\u2019t even begin to place. Some sort of blue bulbous thing, and that one looked like something indecent. To Naoki, Green\u2019s Greens had a very unique feel about it, unlike anywhere else she had been. Exotic and whimsical, yet also warm and welcoming. \u201cThis is quite the shop you have, Kate. Amazing.\u201dRemembering her plan, Naoki takes the wrapped parcel from under her right arm, and proffers it to Kate. \u201cI came to return your things, and\u2026 to...  \u201cNaoki stumbles. She hadn\u2019t rehearsed this part.\u201ctoooo\u2026 see how you were doing! Yes, clearly. You seemed pretty upset yesterday, I thought I should come see\u2026 how you\u2019re... faring...\u201dIn much the same way Naoki could deliberately interfere with the mental processes of others by modifying her body language and enunciation, speaking with Kate seemed to have this disruptive effect on Naoki herself, even though Kate wasn\u2019t likely consciously attempting to have this effect. It felt odd, not being able to find the words. So often she was the affector, but never the affectee.", "1445375758000": "Madame Naoki exhales sharply, maintaining eye contact. \u201cHe did skip work, didn\u2019t he? I don\u2019t think his contract includes days off to be dead.\u201dThat was the end of the part she hadn\u2019t rehearsed. From here, she felt confident things would play into her hands. Kate was getting embarrassed, though. That wasn\u2019t the atmosphere Naoki wanted. She recovers her confidence of speech, and continues. \u201cYes, that would be great. But first, there\u2019s something else you need to do.\u201dThe words hang in the air for a moment, as her eyes sweep around once more, for a final check. There didn\u2019t seem to be anyone else in the shop, and the door was still shut soundly. With a decisive step forward, Naoki closes the final few inches between them, wrapping Kate in her arms. She whispers a single word on a single breath: \u201cRelax.\u201d", "1445465876000": "Over the years, Naoki had heard many people say the words \u201cI\u2019ve missed you.\u201d A fake smile, a siren\u2019s embrace, and she would parrot the words back to them, meaning none of it. Manipulation was her business, and emotional attachment was simply a tool of the trade. \u201cI missed you too.\u201dAs the words slip past her lips, Naoki comes to a realization. She wasn\u2019t feigning her emotions at all. She wasn\u2019t hugging Kate to manipulate her feelings, or whispering sweet nothings in an attempt to get Kate to grow some exotic plant. She could have chosen to send Artemis to return Kate\u2019s clothes, but she chose to do it herself. She could have opted to contact Kate through her Cat\u2019s Paw, or see her the next time she came to tend the garden, but she took time out of her busy schedule to spend it with Kate.There was something very different here, a nuance to this relationship that she had never felt before. Naoki squeezes tighter, embracing the change, and whatever it might bring.Tender moments pass. Naoki releases the hug, and beams at Kate. \u201cNow, how about that tour?\u201d", "1445549627000": "As Kate mentions the properties of the red bush, Madame Naoki\u2019s mouth forms a small \u2018o\u2019. She could think of countless uses for such a plant. It probably wouldn\u2019t be needed with Kate, but still. Countless uses. From around her waist, she unties her shawl, allowing her tail to stand upright, unimpeded and unconcealed. A breath of relief accompanies this motion. \u201cOh, you know... Fine, I\u2019m sure.\u201dShe pauses, wrapping the shawl around her shoulders.\u201cTo be honest, I haven\u2019t really spoken with anyone much since yesterday. I\u2019m sure they\u2019re all fine, though. There\u2019s not any reason for them to be upset anymore, is there?\u201dA hint of her earlier frustration creeps into her voice, and she changes the subject. It\u2019d be a cold day in Hell before she let that madman infringe, even indirectly, on this moment.\u201cHired a new employee the other day, though. I don\u2019t believe you\u2019ve had the pleasure. Mr. Ulciscor; he\u2019s our new chef, very interesting fellow. Once he\u2019s settled in, I suspect he will have a list of ingredients he\u2019ll need.\u201d", "1445708556000": "Madame Naoki adopts an expression of mock annoyance and scoffs. \"You\u2019re two steps ahead; it takes all the fun out of asking you do it for me. That\u2019s how I planned to conclude the date I was just about to ask you on: with you, me, and a scintillating dinner. And I don't mean just in reference to the food.\u201d Naoki meets Kate\u2019s eyes, and grasps her hands in her own. \u201cSo. Have anything planned today?\u201d", "1445800221000": "Naoki too, glances upwards at the sun as it continues its journey across the sky unobscured. In a few short hours, it would be time for lunch.\u201cI think that our first stop could be the grand bazaar; to do some shopping, and assemble a picnic basket. With that basket, we could leave the city, and go have a picnic somewhere. Then we would have some time to spend before returning for dinner.\u201dNaoki speaks with her hands and a slightly more businesslike manner as she illustrates the proposed schedule, motioning with her hands to mimic the travel she\u2019s referring to. When Kate mentions changing, she nods in acknowledgment and agreement. \u201cAlright. Take your time; I\u2019m not in any rush.\u201dNaoki decides it wouldn\u2019t be a good idea to explore the store any further herself, so she opts to lean against one of the nearby structural pillars, holding her hat in her hands, where she will wait until approached.", "1445919014000": "Madame Naoki nods, affirming what Artemis said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be safe to perambulate all about the city by ourselves. There\u2019s bound to be some poor, lowlife lot that would kill for the chance to get their hands on you.\u201cShe flashes Kate another lecherous gaze, before returning to her more serious tone.\u201cOr me, or my purse, for that matter. The two of us alone would make an excellent target for thieves, muggers and the like.\u201dWith her left hand occupied holding Kate\u2019s, Naoki\u2019s bandaged right hand waves about, providing emphasis to her words.\u201cIf you\u2019d rather not Artemis come for whatever reason, that\u2019s fine, I could get someone else, and I don\u2019t think she\u2019d take offense. However, Artemis is, without a doubt, the most qualified to be our shield. We will be able to peruse the bazaar to our heart\u2019s content without a second thought towards our safety; I trust Artemis with my life, and much more.\u201dThere is an awkward pause, as Naoki realizes what meaning Kate might derive from her choice of phrasing. In an attempt to glaze over the moment, she continues speaking, and begins moving towards the door. \u201cAnyway; let\u2019s get going, shall we?\u201d<If no one else would like to post, consider this \u201cExits to Grand Bazaar\u201d>", "1466815962000": "Early in the morning, just as the sun is beginning to crest over the rooftops, Madame Naoki makes her way down the street upon which Green\u2019s Greens has been built. As she treads along down the road, a mood of reflection strikes her, brought about by the similarities between this walk, and the last instance she approached Green\u2019s Greens on foot. Some\u2026 eight months ago, at this point. Goodness. That\u2019s something to consider. She\u2019s been at this for eight months, now. In the gentle throes of introspection, Naoki is somewhat astounded she\u2019s been able to keep it up this long. Eight whole consecutive months of a real, honest to goodness relationship with an actual human being. Without any major disagreements, arguments, breaking-ups, or any of that! Naoki hasn\u2019t messed up yet! Given the extent of her experience with such things, (it\u2019s about eight months worth) Naoki cannot help but derive a bit of pride from that. Beyond that, Naoki\u2019s thoughts lead her to think ahead for what seems like the tenth time today. To the future. On how to continue these sorts of things. To eight more months, and hopefully longer. To the pouch on her hip, and the trip ahead of them. Disconcerting sorts of thoughts, those are. However pleasant the best-case-scenario may be to consider, the nagging and ever-present bad possibilities exist, and will continue to exist and grow more probable as time wears on. Rejection. Disharmony. Hell, assassination is a perfectly valid concern to have. She would need to see about stationing more security around the little shop. The most unsettling thought, Naoki muses, in this situation but also generally speaking, is such that while one may speculate, while one may hope and dream and do their very best to shape the future to their will, there are no certainties. Not in prediction,  preparation, or any other regard of the future, save for the aspect of uncertainty. \u201cThe best-laid plans of mice and men often go awry.\u201d A lesson learned Naoki has learned many times over. But never before- in no other regard, has she dreaded the uncertainty of the future more. However, Naoki is presently ripped from her musings as she reaches her destination. Coming to a halt just outside Green\u2019s Greens, Naoki pauses for a moment to gather her thoughts and reorient herself to time and place. Her gaze makes its way across the assorted flora assembled around the door as she idly smooths the pleats of her peplum. Mostly new plants since the last time, she muses. Taking a deep breath, she\u2019s unable to justify delaying any longer. Forcing some manner of artificial confidence into her steps, Naoki steps past the flowers to approach the door, wasting no more time, rapping three times in quick succession on the door. ", "1467040026000": "Naoki is taken somewhat aback as Kate very nearly stumbles right out the door into her. Kate doesn\u2019t seem to be quite herself this morning, that much is evident. Naoki stands quietly with a slight smile, unyielding under the barrage of questions. However, instead of proceeding inward, or offering some trifling verbal greeting, Naoki does as she seems to have developed a tendency to, surging forward to wrap the individual of her affections in a tight embrace where she stands. After a moment of silent closeness, Naoki speaks softly, face partially immersed in that disheveled silvery hair, \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you. Today is Thursday, the twentieth of June. Happy Birthday.\u201dAfter a brief squeeze- putting those biceps to use, Naoki provides a peck on the cheek as she disengages, and proceeds into the shop as invited, tail held high. As she looks around, examining the greenery surrounding them on all sides and how it has changed since her last visit, she continues, \u201cAlso, the first day of our trip, if all goes as I would like. The carriage is being prepared for the journey, fitted with new wheels and loaded up with food and such. But I couldn\u2019t stand waiting, so I came a bit early. They should be along\u2026\u201dShe trails off, unsure, before firmly settling on the ambiguous: \u201cPresently. We have a few minutes to spend. How are you? Ready? You don\u2019t seem as if you\u2019ve\u2026\u201d The first thing that springs to mind is \u2018bathed\u2019, but Naoki opts to go for, \u201c... slept well.\u201dShe lingers just beyond the entryway, hands clasped behind her back, waiting to be directed in one direction or another.", "1467133730000": "\u201cAlright, good. I\u2019ll be here.\u201dSeating herself in the offered chair, Naoki idly wonders, as she looks around, what sort of botany-related business could keep one up late at night. The plants don\u2019t sleep, do they? Not usually, as far as she\u2019s aware. Even if they do, they ought to sleep at night. Though. Not much about Green\u2019s Greens is \u201cusual\u201d, she supposes. There may very well be some\u2026 singing tulips or somesuch that would keep one up late into the night, or some plant that subsists purely on moonlight, for all Naoki is aware. That would be interesting, she muses. However, her speculations are cut short as Kate returns. Naoki opens her mouth as if to speak, but pauses just before speaking a word, whole body going rigid. Her ears swivel off to the left, having apparently heard something. Naoki listens for just a moment more before relaxing and responding, \u201cThe carriage is just down the street. They\u2019ll be here in a half-minute, where\u2019s your bag?\u201dSurely enough, almost exactly thirty seconds later, the very same great iron carriage used to transport the pair of them up to the Chalet comes to a halt just before Green\u2019s Greens However, today, it is adorned not with the Midnight Sun logo, but the red and gold heraldry of Isra. The carriage is surrounded by riders on horseback, their scarves identifying them as Sun Marshals.Assuming that Kate is as prepared as she is going to be, with all of her bags and assorted accoutrements she\u2019d like to bring on the trip, Naoki offers Vito a perfunctory wave, before moving to the door, holding it open for Kate, and proceeding outside behind her. Once outside, Naoki casts an inquisitive eyebrow in the direction of the Sun Marshal leading the formation. He simply nods in response. Nodding mostly to herself, Naoki gestures in the direction of the entry ladder, which has been extended from the rear of the vehicle. An attendant stands off to one side, prepared to handle any luggage. \u201cAfter you.\u201d This statement is accompanied by the slightest of suppressed smirks as Naoki moves into a position directly behind the ladder, presumably to observe Kate\u2019s ascent. The interior of the carriage is more or less just as it was, save a few pieces of new upholstery. Artemis is seated on one of the long couches, but if any surprises lie in wait, they are hidden.", "1467580474000": "Jul 3, 2016 7:42:06 GMT -8 Kate Green said:[Empress Naoki ]Kate shrugged. \u201cWell, how can I not be. Anything that gets me out of this city for a while is a cause of celebration in itself.\u201d She was over her earlier tiredness, for now, and looking forward the trip ahead. She took a seat next to artemis and invited Naoki, who no longer had a butt to stare, to follow her example. Kate straightened her dress, and looked out the window. It was a nice, sunny day, perfect for travelling. She started whistling a tune, waiting for Naoki to signal the caravan to move out.Following Kate up into the carriage, Naoki takes her time to admire the view. No one has ever accused Naoki of being courteous, after all. Moving up into the carriage, she pauses just over the threshold, running through her mental checklist. At the invitation, Naoki hesitates for a moment. Her thoughts stray to the cabinet off to the left, and what ought to be inside. But not yet. They had only just boarded the carriage. Better to keep her guessing for a short while. Naoki had subtly alluded, but hadn\u2019t outright stated. It would be interesting to see if she\u2019d get antsy, or ask about it. Crossing over to the bench, she takes the offered seat, careful to settle her tail comfortably off to the side. Scooting a bit closer, Naoki exhales deeply, simply enjoying the sensation of being close, and the calming effect Kate seems to have. Not to mention, this is the beginning of a period of time when they\u2019ll be spending lots of time together, and Naoki won\u2019t be spending any time in The Citadel. No statecraft. No documents to sign. No meetings. Just Kate, Artemis, the open road, mother nature. And probably monsters of some variety. Wyverns or trolls or giants or whatever other manner of beast The Expanse has to offer. But also ten of her finest Sun Marshals, and a squad of Dawn Riders. Considering those odds, Naoki will choose the wyverns over Ryden\u2019s steel tongue any day of the week. Leaning back, Naoki settles in for the journey, as pleased as she\u2019s been all week, but probably not quite as pleased as she\u2019ll be as the week ahead wears on. ", "1471405943000": "On a somewhat foggy but otherwise as-of-yet unremarkable Monday morning, Madame Naoki makes her way over to Dawnfire Forges. In one hand, she carries a bag- which is somewhat uncharacteristic of her. However, today, she walks with an intent: the intent to place an order.Or three, as the case may be. Regardless, Naoki quickly and quietly weaves her way through the chaos that is Dawnfire Forges in the morning. Even though the initial rush of the first morning\u2019s light has worn off, activity is everywhere- as should be expected of the largest industrial center in the world. Regardless, it\u2019s too early in the morning for such extraneous emotions as \u2018pride\u2019, or \u2018irritation\u2019 so Naoki simply continues on her way. Presently enough, she reaches the center of the sprawling complex, the titular Dawnfire Forge itself. With business inside, Naoki takes her bag, ascends the stairs, and proceeds to search out her quarry: Forgemaster Epirus. ", "1471516557000": "As she makes her way over, reveling in the warmth, Naoki wonders if Erpuis is capable of any sort of smile besides a warm one. Cold gazes are probably all but impossible. Regardless, she reciprocates with a smile of her own and a small wave; Erpius has earned her favor. With a grateful nod, she responds, \u201cShe did indeed. I\u2019ll not elaborate, but you have my most sincere thanks for that piece of work.\u201d Leaving it at that, she continues, \u201cYou'll be pleased, though. I\u2019ve decided that I require armor. Let me show you what I have in mind...\u201d Reaching into her back, Naoki extracts a small quill, a matching vial of ink, and a pad to draw upon. Holding these items in one hand, she casts an eye about for somewhere to sit- or at least to lean against.", "1471604971000": "Responding with only a small nod, Naoki follows Epirus up to his office. Silently, she reflects that she really ought to look into finding more fire elementals to spend time around. It\u2019s very nice- being as warm as this, walking in the wake of a being whose very form consists primarily of heat itself. Entering the room, she seems unfazed by the chairs\u2019 lack of padding- having brought her own. However, when a moment after she settles into the chair, it molds itself to her shape- that elicits a thoughtful sort of \u201cHmh.\u201d It\u2019s not an unpleasant sensation, though, so Naoki takes the matter no further, instead turning her attention to her scribing tools. \u201cArmor. I am here to request some armor. More than one set, even\u2026\u201dTrailing off, her quill meets the pad. For the space of a minute or so, Naoki falls silent, concentrating on her drawing. However, it only takes her that long to complete it. Grasping the pad by the top, she turns it to display to Epirus- the faintest hint of a smug grin on her face. Drawing is something she\u2019s been practicing- and it would seem to show. \u201cI\u2019d like something styled like this. The specifics of how it all interlocks and which plates go where is up to you, but I\u2019d like it to be styled in this manner, with the emphases being placed on mobility and elegance. Though it may not be obvious, I can move fairly quickly when required to, so if this suit could not restrict my range of motion very much, and not be too too heavy, that would be ideal.\u201dReturning the pad to her lap, Naoki continues to work the quill as she continues, \u201cI\u2019d like this suit to be applicable for any situation in which I might require it, and as such, I would like to request spares, swappable situational components, and all of the extras and accessories you think I might ever require.\u201dOff to the left of her depiction, Naoki has drawn another image of herself- minus the armor. Now, she proceeds to label this second image with her measurements, which would presumably be required. Shimmying slightly in her seat, Naoki idly notes how comfortable this chair is. Perhaps she'd have to see about getting a few of these later. Seemingly finished with her quill, Naoki nods slightly to herself, places the pad atop the desk, and swivels it about so Epirus can get a good look without touching it. \u201cDo you require any additional information from me to produce this?\u201d She quirks an eyebrow in his direction. ", "1471934265000": "As the drawing begins etching, Naoki opens her mouth as if to protest, but does not. She intended to make a few minor alterations, but what\u2019s done is done, and she holds the pad still for the duration of the etching. \u201cI leave the enchantments entirely to your discretion, with the caveat that I\u2019m going to be using this suit only in situations which warrant wearing such a thing. That is to say, situations in which the next item I\u2019m about to request will be insufficient. As such, cut no corners when it comes to protection. All else- with the exception of what I already mentioned, is secondary. If you need to cut down on utilities to prevent hostile magic from penetrating the suit, so be it.\u201dFor a moment, she seems content with her response. However, another thought strikes her, which she articulates as follows. \u201cOh- actually\u2026! I would like the gauntlets- a secondary set, not the primary, specialised for increasing force. That is to say, built specifically for punching. Punching holes in things that aren\u2019t meant to have holes punched in them.\u201d This line is delivered without any additional inflection or smirk on her part, as if she had simply asked for some entirely mundane feature. ", "1471953281000": "Naoki shrugs doubtfully, \u201c... I think that may be difficult to surprise me. I already expect the very best from you.\u201dWith that comment delivered- apparently seriously, Naoki takes her pad back down, re-inks her quill, flips to a new page on her pad, and begins another drawing. After getting most of the important bits outlined, she begins to speak again. \u201cNow, about this second item. I would like to have the option of being protected without wearing the full suit, there.\u201d With the end of her quill, she points in the direction of the stone etching. \u201cRegardless of how well you construct it, how light Sunmetal is, or the enchantments placed upon it, it\u2019s going to be a full suit of armor. Not something that\u2019s going to be comfortable to wear for long periods of time, not something that I\u2019ll be able to put on and take off myself, and not something that\u2019s going to be quite as flattering as I might like.\u201dFor a moment, she pauses, focusing intently on some small detail before continuing, \u201cAs such, I would like to request a secondary outfit, of a somewhat more\u2026 irregular sort. As I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware, I utilise gem magic. I have this pouch on my hip, and it contains a fairly sizeable collection of gemstones pre-enchanted to execute spell effects when triggered. I have one that emits light, another that when thrown, will explode, and this one in my ear that I am using even now to communicate with my associates.\u201dShe swivels her right ear to draw attention to her amethyst earring, constantly glimmering as she speaks telepathically to goodness-knows-who.\u201cThe reason I bring this up, however, is one of my gems here\u2026\u201d Setting the pad and quill down in her lap, Naoki spends a moment to select the correct gem from her pouch before holding it before Epirus. It is a piece of yellow, grossular garnet, cut into a multifaceted sort of rounded-square shape. It\u2019s about as large as Naoki\u2019s thumbnail. Holding it carefully between thumb and forefinger of her left hand, Naoki begins to activate it, the gemstone glowing faintly as she does so. \u201cThis gemstone here is capable...\u201dAs she trails off, a shape begins to form around the gemstone, and by extension, her hand. It\u2019s a vague sort of rounded-cube shape, centered on the gemstone. It seems to be more or less ethereal, not quite there, but rather the physical manifestation of some manner of magic. It\u2019s about a foot to a side, and the face of the cube that would have intersected with Naoki\u2019s forearm- had it been there, is absent. \u201c... Of creating shields of sorts. Watch this.\u201dMoving the gemstone into the palm of her left hand, Naoki raises her right, extending her fingers to press with the palm of her hand against the surface of the cube. Strangely enough, she doesn\u2019t seem to be able to use her right hand to touch her left no matter how much force she applies with the right, which stopped by the shield. Where the yellow light touches her skin, it shines more brightly, even cracking slightly.Moving onto the next demonstration, Naoki uses her right hand to pluck her bottle of ink off the desk, and carefully places it atop the cube. The transparent yellow light doesn\u2019t even so much as waver under the weight, easily suspending the bottle of ink in mid-air.\u201cShield,\u201d Naoki states, gesturing with her right hand to her left. After Epirus has had a moment or so to look at the thing, the cube of ethereal energy abruptly dissipates, which drops the bottle of ink right down into her open palm, and from there, smoothly back onto the desk. In the same motion, Naoki also places the gemstone before Epirus, leaving it there for his examination as she picks up her pad, re-inks her quill, and resumes drawing. \u201cWhat I would like is a suit of armor utilising gemstones like that one to provide protection to its wearer. It is possible to utilise multiple \u2018shields\u2019 in parallel if done carefully, or even use multiple gems to contribute to the same whole- again, if done carefully.\u201d\u201cThough such a thing has never- as far as I\u2019m aware, been done before, the concept that I\u2019m describing ought to provide a number of benefits over traditional armor that would make it an ideal alternative to the proper suit. Namely, not having to wear armor plates. Instead, one ought to be able to get away with\u2026 much less.\u201dWith that, Naoki turns her drawing pad for Epirus to see the progress. It depicts a woman who- at least so far, lacks any feline endowments, but is sporting a very flattering red dress. The dress is ornamented both with a pattern of flames and a few irregular and asymmetrical pieces of armor. A full left shoulderpad and breastguard, an elaborate neck, half of a right shoulder that extends down to cover the right elbow, a left gauntlet, some manner of plating on the right hip, and a very nice pair of matching boots. The woman also holds a sword, but it can be assumed that the sword is only there to balance the image artistically- Naoki has never exhibited or professed any degree of swordsmanship. \u201cThe idea being that the gemstones would be embedded into bits of armor spread across the body, and the wearer would be able to activate the shields as needed.\u201dWith that, Naoki stops, allowing Epirus to ponder the matter and articulate his thoughts at his leisure. ", "1472225531000": "\u201cWell,\u201d Naoki continues, \u201cThe reason I bring this enchantment to your attention using  gem specifically is the ease with which its effects can be toggled. You saw me use it just there, it\u2019s very easy, because I have a fair amount of practice working with this manner of enchanted gemstone. While there is going to have to be some ingenuity on your part to get the effect working across the whole set of armor, I expect there will also be a stage in which I\u2019ll have to learn how to properly utilise it, and for that, I expect we\u2019ll want to meet again, perhaps on multiple occasions.\u201d Naoki is quite surprised as the tablet is flung without any warning, leaning slightly to the left as if to avoid it, even though it really wouldn\u2019t have hit her. Flying stone tablets do not bode well for plush individuals such as herself. As her tail begins to deflate, Naoki leans down to reach once more into her bag. From it, she extracts a scroll, rolled and bound by a nondescript red ribbon. Removing the ribbon, she unrolls the scroll, and spreads it on the desk before Erpius. \u201cThis is the third item I would like to request.\u201dThe diagram depicts a round, curved piece of sunmetal, that one would presume to be a large shield, if not for the lack of grip, and how monstrously heavy the item would be. Intricate stylisation marks a \u2018top\u2019, and the outer surface bears a number of very specifically notated indentations and empty settings. The object is depicted from multiple angles in what ought to be a legitimate metallurgic diagram, leaving little to no room for interpretation. The design seems to be one specialised for strength and structural integrity.\u201cI would not like any enchantments or extra feature on this item. Simply the depicted item, constructed exactly as such.\u201d ", "1472777305000": "Shaking her head, Naoki indicates the negative. \u201cThere is not, no; nothing more. Do you have any further questions for me, or shall I leave you to your work?\u201dIn anticipation of his response, she begins to pack up her accoutrements, corking her bottle of ink, stowing her quill in its case, and loading the lot back into her bag. ", "1472841163000": "\u201cAs each item is ready, if you would. I don\u2019t expect to require the use of any of these items any time soon, but I\u2019m somewhat excited to simply have them, so.\u201dShe offers a small shrug. ", "1473196941000": "As strangely as the smile suits Epirus, Naoki reciprocates it as she concludes packing her bag, quietly hoping that she has interpreted the gesture correctly. \u201cExcellent; I\u2019ll look forward to your call. I wish you a good remainder of your day\u00a0and trust that everything will proceed smoothly within your jurisdiction here. Until we meet again.\u201dIn lieu of a handshake (which would be very ill-advised; Naoki charrs easily) Naoki instead offers The Forgemaster a slow nod from across the desk. After allowing him to offer whatever goodbyes he might care to, she stands, picks up her bag, and departs, escorting herself back down the stairs, outside, and from the premises of Dawnfire Forges entirely.", "1475074451000": "The following morning, before it\u2019s socially acceptable to arrive at most establishments, and notably, before the sun has risen, Madame Naoki arrives at Dawnfire Forges. In doing so, she finds herself among those smiths who arrive for that first bit of the dawn\u2019s light. Some have said  that the dawn\u2019s light is purer- superior to the light from the rest of the day. Naoki, not being excessively well versed in the magic behind the big crystal, nor the intricacies of smithing, finds herself without the requisite background to say one way or the other. It is interesting to see all of the smiths setting up, however. Getting all of their smithing gubbins in place and whatnot. The anticipation is nearly palpable. Regardless, Naoki didn\u2019t exactly come for the spectacle of it, and proceeds inward, toward the titular Dawnfire Forge, and The Forgemaster\u2019s office. ", "1475194029000": "As Naoki proceeds into the room, Epirus is offered a wave, but not much more as far as greetings go. Her attention is instead directed toward the mentioned suit of armor, standing there on its stand. \u201cOh, ho-hooo... Look at that.\u201dHaving properly entered the room, Naoki folds her hands behind her back and approaches the armor as it steps down. At this, she quirks an eyebrow, not remembering anything regarding the armor moving by itself, but dismisses the thought for the time being to examine the armor more thoroughly. Assuming that it remains still throughout her examination, Naoki proceeds to proceed around it, examining the helmet as she passes to the right, stepping up on the pedestal and back down to the other side, taking note of all visible features as she does so and very deliberately not reaching out to touch it. After about a minute or so- apparently finished for the moment, she turns to Eprius and addresses him, \u201cIt looks excellent. I wasn\u2019t expecting orange, but in practice, I can\u2019t say that I\u2019m dissatisfied with the appearance. Is there anything you\u2019d like to say about it?\u201d", "1475310121000": "\u201cAh, I see.\u201d Naoki seems visibly relieved that the armor won\u2019t walk by itself. Listening on as Eprius continues to detail some of the armor\u2019s utilities, Naoki nods with approval, glancing back and forth between him and the armor. After he seems to be finished, Naoki voices the first of her questions, \u201cWith the flying charm, what sort of garments should I wear under it? Standard armor padding? I assume that the flying charm doesn't have impact dampening properties.\"", "1475648493000": "Though she raises an eyebrow in confusion, Naoki nods along quietly. Silently, she wonders what would protect her from blunt trauma, at that point. Some bloke with a hammer, or simply a large enough sword would be able to knock her senseless somewhat easily, even if they can\u2019t pierce the plating. Though, she supposes large men with hammers are probably going to be a problem no matter what sort of armor she\u2019s wearing.As Epirus goes on to mention the claws, however, Naoki\u2019s eyebrow slides right back down to furrow with its partner in an expression of irritation. Just because she has cat ears and a tail does not mean she would like to eat a raw fish. Or drink some milk. Or purrs. Those who have assumed such things have traditionally been glared at, or perhaps given a black eye. (In one extreme case, Artemis performed a Penectomy- despite not possessing a license to do so.)\u00a0Likewise, Naoki is unamused by this \u2018clever\u2019 and unprompted addition to her armor. If she had wanted something like that, she would have asked. However\u2026 she cannot deny the utility of it. Seeing as how the claws are hidden until the wearer chooses to deploy them, and how they seemed to deploy with a significant amount of force\u2026 that\u2019s actually very handy, Naoki is forced to admit. Like having a handful of daggers- or rather, two handfuls of daggers. For this reason and this alone, Naoki chooses not to make a point of it. If anyone teases her about them, she\u2019ll just claw their face off. That seems about reasonable, she thinks. \u201cI see. Excellent.\u201dCircling around the armor once more, Naoki finds herself without any additional questions. Seeing as how she doesn\u2019t have any garments on hand that would be suitable for wearing beneath the armor, and Epirus isn\u2019t really the ideal choice to assist her in putting it on, Naoki figures it best to try it on later. Cautiously, she reaches out toward the helmet with two hands, Naoki pauses as she remembers that the only thing holding the armor upright is a charm. \u201cMay I pick this up, or will it fall over\u2026?\u201d", "1475747362000": "With a small nod, Naoki proceeds to finish the motion of taking the helmet from under the arm of her armor, and holds it in her hands for a moment, examining it. It\u2019s an awfully intimidating sort of thing, she muses. Seems to have a visor of some sort, and accommodations for her ears. Seeing as how hats are not built with cat-ears in mind, Naoki has never really taken a liking to the concept of headgear, only owning perhaps one or two head ornaments and ones that don\u2019t interfere with her ears, at that. This jump- from not having anything at all on her head to suddenly having a big metal bucket- even if doesn\u2019t weight much, proves to be a bit much at first as she slides the helmet down onto her head from above with no small amount of trepidation. For a moment, she simply stands there, frozen, with the helmet on her head and the visor down. Silently, her tail begins to twitch and thrash. Abruptly, both hands come up to flail at either side of the helmet, frantically attempting to locate the visor release. After a moment of panicked flailing, she finds it, uses it, slides the visor up, and releases a breath she didn\u2019t realize she had been holding. However, having failed to re-engage the lock with the visor in the up position, as soon as she removes her hand, it comes crashing down, the noise of it reverberating around inside the helmet and locking her back into that tiny, metal bucket. This development elicits a surprised, \u201cBwahhhh\u2026!\u201d sound from everyone\u2019s favorite cat lady and a substantial amount of tail-bushing. After a moment more of panicked flailing, Naoki successfully gets the visor back up and is careful to engage the lock this time. Waving a single trembling finger menacingly in Epirus\u2019 direction, Naoki offers this comment with her more measured and regal tone, \u201cI appreciate the utility offered by the visor, but I am not a fan of the way that it feels inside the helmet when it is down.\u201dSomewhat calmer than she was, Naoki proceeds to locate the chin strap, and fastens that. With the helmet well and properly situated on her head, she proceeds to test the fit more thoroughly, rolling her head about on her shoulders, flexing her jaw, and finally, attempting to swivel her ears. \u201cAttempting\u201d being the key word, there. As it turns out, the accommodations for her ears- while well placed and sized, do not turn. Grumbling quietly to herself, Naoki resolves that while a bit of discomfort is a fine price to pay for not getting an arrow lodged in her skull, that does not mean that she has to enjoy wearing the helmet. Seeing as how everything seems to be more or less in order, she undoes the chin strap, removes the helmet in its entirety, and stands there for a moment more, holding it, before she addresses the Forgemaster, \u201cHow is armor usually carried?\u201d", "1475918491000": "Nodding along, before shaking her head to indicate the negative, Naoki thinks that Epirus sort of missed where she was going with that. \u201cWell, yes, but seeing as how I can\u2019t very well wear it in this outfit\u2026\u201d she says, gesturing to her ruffled white blouse,\u00a0\u201c... I was sort of asking in a roundabout way if you have any rags or bags around here such so that I can carry it back to The Citadel. Admittedly, I probably should have thought ahead and bought one myself, but I did not.\u201dTo emphasise this last statement, Naoki displays the palms of her hands to Epirus. She doesn\u2019t seem to have anything at all on her besides the clothes she wears, her assorted jewelry, and the black pouch on her hip. Nothing that would be suitable for carrying armor in, certainly. ", "1476418066000": "Shaking her head to indicate the negative, Naoki responds, \u201cAs it so happens, my carriage is waiting outside. I\u2019ve got a few other errands to run around the city and as such, won\u2019t need to carry this any further than just out to the carriage.\u201dHefting the satchel up over her shoulder, Naoki grunts a bit under the weight but seems to be able to handle it. \u201cAssuming that you have nothing further, I must take my leave. There\u2019s\u2026 a lot to be done. Thank you again for this, and I will see you again when the next item is ready- or if I encounter any issues with this, though I don\u2019t expect that. Either way, until then.\u201dLoosening her grip on the satchel, Naoki raises one hand to wave in farewell- figuring it would probably be unwise of her to offer any sort of bow. Assuming that Epirus has nothing further and does not prevent her from doing so, Naoki proceeds to leave the facility, shuffling her way back down the stairwell  to the exit. ", "1502315188000": "Some half hour later, the door to the library swings open again. Entering is none other than The Empress Naoki, having seemingly come alone. Dressed today in a manner of double-breasted jacket, it seems as if she\u2019s prepared to travel. After a few moments spent traversing the shelves, she happens across the room\u2019s other inhabitant. She pauses; scoffs with amusement, disbelief.  \u201cWhy, look who\u2019s risen from the grave!\u201dExtending an arm, Naoki grasps one skeletal hand in a handshake before deciding to go one step further and pulls Reese into a hug, hard edges and his wants be damned. Intentionally staying for a second too long and squeezing a bit harder than may perhaps be appropriate, Naoki pulls back to hold his shoulders at arm\u2019s length. Looking unblinkingly into those empty eye sockets, she asks, \u201cWhere. In the heeeell. Haveyoubeen.\u201d", "1502664199000": "Amused by his reaction, Naoki smirked to herself as Reese goes on to offer his explanation. She listens attentively, ears pointed forward, nodding every so often. \u201cWell. Welcome home, Reese. You\u2019ve been sorely missed.\u201dAnother clap on the shoulder, then Naoki moves to lean against a bookcase.\u201cAs I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen, much has transpired in your absence. I\u2019ve done quite well for myself, I should think.\u201dWith this, she offers the sort of smug expression one who has gone from penniless vagabond to ruler of the majority of the known world in less than a decade might.A habit Naoki hasn\u2019t lost, she talks with her hands as she continues, \u201cYou speak now to the effective ruler of the world. The Isran Empire, as it is now titled, now controls not just these plains, the Norkari Mountains, and the Winterlands, but also what was once Medan, the city of Sakand and its surrounding territory, as well as the entirety of The Expanse. No plausibly comparable power is known.\u201d\u201cYou and I, we have much to discuss. I have a great many things to tell you but this is not the place - not private and we ought not to chatter in this library, we both have a shred of common courtesy about us. So come with me.\u201dStanding back up off the bookcase, Naoki gestures and begins toward the door, tail swaying, pleased. Over one shoulder, she asks, \u201cAnd, what of the battle? What conclusion did you reach?\u201d", "1503207252000": "\u201cHmmh.\u201d A thoughtful murmur. Lady Naoki turns back about to push the door open and moves out into the hall. She pauses for a moment to hold the door for Reese before leading the way down the corridor.\u201cFair enough, I suppose,\u201d she says, walking silently through the hallway. \u201cWe\u2019re to travel by magic; out of the city. I think you\u2019ll quite like this\u2026\u201d Naoki trails off as she leads the way onward. [Exit to Chalet du Sommet Minuit]", "1507422509000": "It\u2019s well into the afternoon as Lady Naoki enters the library. Light from the windows stretches far across the room; it isn\u2019t quite dark enough for candles, but it will be soon. Naoki navigates her way through the shelves not at a leisurely way, but slowly, ponderously. She pays little mind to the signage, the racks, or those around her, instead making a thorough assessment of the floor and its rugs as she goes. Preoccupied. She presently arrives at her destination: the Restricted Section. A glance toward the attending librarian and the door is opened, granting her entry to The Restricted Section. Home to those books who don\u2019t quite qualify as \u201cregular,\u201d who have potentially dangerous magic within, and those that detail magics that have been decided to be hazardous, among others. The Citadel Library is available to any who can enter, but access to this portion is limited. For safety. Here, Naoki looks up and begins to scan the shelves. She\u2019s searching for a particular tome she\u2019d seen once before, hoping it might contain the answers she seeks. It isn't where it was before. ... Ah, there it is. Moved down to the bottom. With the appropriate level of care, Naoki removes it from the shelf and turns to exit. This book is of the physically mundane, dangerous information sort, so there isn\u2019t any reason she would need to stay in the Restricted Section to read it. Given that the chairs in there are rubbish, Naoki passes back through the door and makes her way over and up a short ladder as to reach a reading nook inside one of the window frames. After rearranging the cushions and settling in, Naoki feels it appropriate to yawn and stretch lengthwise. It\u2019s warm up here. A few moments are spent basking in the sun before Naoki cracks the book open and sets about it.", "1508002332000": "Looking up, Lady Naoki is almost surprised to see Zemp. Not that she wouldn\u2019t have expected to come across him in the library, and not that requests are infrequent, but that Josef Zemp has one. It\u2019s his first phrased as such. Whatever it is, she thinks, he\u2019s undoubtedly earned it.Bookmark in place, Naoki sets her book aside and turns to face him, giving him the entirety of her attention.\u201cCertainly,\u201d she says, \u201cHere?\u201d ", "1508383766000": "Lady Naoki quietly sits as Zemp speaks, both ears trained in his direction. She considers offering to open the necklace, but it doesn\u2019t seem an appropriate time to do so. After it looks like he\u2019s finished, Naoki nods, spending a moment to mull. \u201cAlright.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s very doable. I\u2019ll have the Chancellor informed about your time off, and I will see to it that you receive a bonus immediately to cover it. Later, at such time it would be appropriate to do so, I will provide additional funds for the restoration of your monuments and...\u201d Gesturing with one hand, she searches for the word.  \u201cNeeds. Furnishings or robes or whatever else...\u201d A wavy gesture suggests that she\u2019s not especially concerned with specifically how Zemp uses the money.\u201cAnd,\u201d Naoki adds an afterthought, \u201cI\u2019ll give you access to my architect and builders. Your renovations will be done well by their hand.\u201d", "1509888454000": "Naoki meets and holds Zemp\u2019s stare for a few moments before looking away to observe the librarian, who seems to be occupied reshelving books. She silently contemplates the beauty found in the juxtaposition of short skirts and tall ladders as she considers Zemp\u2019s question.It\u2019s only after a healthy pause that Naoki responds. \u201cThough I don\u2019t speak for others, I am a social creature, and I live for others. I\u2019ve made friends of the best this world has to offer. I\u2019ve adopted my daughter, and I\u2019ve even found a gorgeous woman who loves me almost as much as I love her. I can\u2019t imagine life without any of them; it wouldn\u2019t be worth it.\u201d \u201cAnd when I phrase it like that, it\u2019s very easy to draw the contrast, see.\u201d Holding Zemp\u2019s gaze, Naoki lets the silence hang for a moment.Taking a metaphorical step back, she starts again, \u201cYou\u2019re missing fulfillment in your life, just like so many others. I can\u2019t say with any certainty where you\u2019ll find it- no one can. But I think that the best place to look is in others, so if you feel a draw toward your people, your religion, pursue them. If you don\u2019t find what you\u2019re looking for, all you can do, all anyone can do, is keep looking.\u201dShe nods, mostly to herself. That seems specious enough.", "1511735319000": "Several times, Naoki opens her mouth as if to say something, but does not. She watches Zemp\u2019s retreating back with a thinly veiled scowl, and if anyone were close enough, they would be able to hear her grumbling wordlessly.What would he have liked her to say? What\u2019s the correct answer to that question? Out of all the possible things she could have possibly said, no matter what she chose, she suspects he would have left on that same, melancholy note.He could have taken the money and the advice, nodded, thanked her, and left in a manner that wouldn\u2019t leave her to dwell on him and his troubles for the rest of the day. The illusion that gold can solve all of life\u2019s problems is a pleasant one to maintain, but there he goes, ruining it! Monster.\u201cHmmph\u2026!\u201d Naoki huffs a small, feminine, huff and thrashes her tail once. Maybe she will enjoy some of those fresh pleasures - just to spite him. She stomps about halfway to the door, deliberating on how to maximise her hedonistic efficiency for the next few hours before she remembers her book, and sheepishly doubles back.", "1540269284000": "The Empress enters the Citadel Library with the intention to study how rulers of the past have handled the matter of succession. Hereditary transfer of power is fine and all, but she\u2019s curious to read about the special cases. How succession crises have transpired in the past, and how clever rulers have acted in her position. She knows what the right answer is, but studying is an effective means of procrastination \u2014 and it\u2019ll probably help.On the way in, she spots Venus (with her skin on) having a discussion with Jers from The Treasury Department and someone else whose name doesn\u2019t immediately spring to mind. It doesn\u2019t seem like a particularly friendly discussion, either. Naoki waves as she moves past.", "1540409086000": "\u201cVery well.\u201d The Empress stops and turns to face the motley crew. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d she asks. ", "1540523759000": "\u201cHmm.\u201d Striking a contemplative look, The Empress puts a hand to her chin and considers. \u201cThe first thing to consider is that festivals are done on flexible budgets. The evaluation of how much and where to spend money is done as part of the festival planning process, not as part of any of the larger periodic budgets.\u201d\u201cStill, spending less on The Enclave would mean we could spend more on the Arts as you describe. But, there would need to be a compelling reason to do so.\u201d\u201cThe benefit of funding The Enclave is that we retain our dominance in the field. No other entity has as large, as powerful, as well-equipped, or as modern a group of magi as Isra. There are no comparable institutions of learning; when a child is found to have ability, they\u2019re sent here, and become an asset.\u201d The Empress speaks with her hands, gesturing to punctuate her sentences.\u201cYou could choose to make a distinction between maintaining The Enclave and funding their research, but that\u2019s a difficult distinction to make. Because really, what are they doing over there? They\u2019re training the new generation, and they\u2019re doing research. We could attempt to scale back the research and pay only to keep the torches lit, but then the magical talent would go elsewhere to do their research.\u201d\u201cA better argument would be to assert that The Enclave is not spending its gold wisely. That is a legitimate concern, especially as far as accidents are concerned.

That was the example I used, so I hope he\u2019s addressed it by this point.\u201dWatching Venus change, Naoki does her best not to stare, but the process is\u2026 interesting. She isn\u2019t sure why Venus is changing, or whatever it is she\u2019s getting at but doesn\u2019t mention it. She also doesn't address any \"protocol,\" as she isn't functioning in an official capacity.In response to Lorraine\u2019s second comment, The Empress shrugs. \u201cYou should probably speak with the head of your department about parks.

The small collection of offices are quiet and vacant, only stacks of tomes and bound volumes fill the seats. This topic post will be updated once the renovations are complete.

Cautiously, she pushes the door inward, and peers inside. She is greeted by darkness. The room before her is pitch black, save for the block of light allowed in through the open door. Fumbling around in her pouch, Naoki selects a gem. A small orb of citrine. Holding it aloft between two fingers, she activates it. Piercing light radiates outward from the gem, instantly illuminating the room. Holding the gem such so that the palm of her hand is between her eyes and the glowing orb, she advances into the room, gazing around at its contents.Dusty shelves filled with scrolls line every wall of the room, and more loose paperwork litters every available surface. Tomes stacked upon chairs, crates of scrolls piled in the corners, bound stacks of documents littered across the tables. No evidence of regular  inhabitants or recent visitors is obvious, it seems as if the room is simply a dumping ground for any financial paperwork The Citadel happens across. \u201cIt\u2019s less busy than I thought it might be\u2026\u201d Naoki makes a dry understatement to the empty room, referring to the obvious absence of any employees or treasury workers, or indeed, any evidence of human interaction with the room, beyond the dumped paperwork.But wait. There, on the single desk situated in the middle of the room, atop a ledger, another piece of paper, with a short, handwritten message scrawled across it. Naoki plucks the note from its dusty perch, and reads it. Good luck.She scowls, and places the note back down. Apparently whoever had previously been assigned to managing Isra\u2019s finances had given up, perhaps overwhelmed by the sheer size of the task. She wanders over to one of the bookcases, and holds the gem up to examine its contents. After a solid five minutes of careful examination, she is unable to discern any sort of pattern or organization structure to the documents on the bookshelf, other than they all seem to be more than six months old, and the objects are all stacked in a very space-efficient manner. Spotting a familiar seal on one of the scrolls, she carefully pulls it out, causing a minor disturbance within the stack as the other scrolls tumble down to fill its place. Taking the scroll back over to the desk in the center of the room, she locates a half burned candle, and places the gemstone in the depression, allowing the candlestick to serve as a stand for her light source. Turning back to the scroll, she undoes the sun-symbol wax seal, and unrolls the scroll across the collage of papers on the desk. If the seal, sealed by her own signet ring wasn\u2019t enough confirmation, the document reveals its identity as last year\u2019s tax paperwork, witten in her own hand, and delivered personally to the Citadel gates just under a year ago. Apparently never, up until this point, even so much as skimmed by any treasury worker. Madame Naoki sighs deeply, fully realizing the task ahead of her. She had always assumed that Isra\u2019s success  had someone behind it all. Some little office of qualified and diligent financial experts, working away quietly to manage the nation\u2019s budget. But apparently, no such organization exists! Or perhaps there was, up until recently - or perhaps not so recently, judging by the dust on, well, everything. How does the country even function? She tries to imagine The Midnight Sun operating without her work on the finances, every first Tuesday of each month. She can\u2019t do it. The business would collapse in a matter of weeks as problems run unchecked and salaries go unpaid. Who even pays the city guards? The military, or the ministers? Apparently nobody is managing the money! With a small grunt, she lifts a stack of tomes off the singular, worn seat, and places them on the floor. Taking the seat herself, she lets fly another long sigh, beginning to consider how to best rectify this\u2026 situation. It\u2019s very much a \u2018situation\u2019, she thinks. Was Ildesias even aware of this? Did she seem like a miracle worker to him?As the beginnings of a plan begin to take shape, Naoki reaches across the desk, and grasps the note. Pulling it over to sit before her, she takes another look at its message, mentally thanks the author, and turns it over. Within the desk, she locates some rudimentary writing implements, and begins to record, on the back of the note, the steps she would need to take to save the city.", "1456390928000": "From behind a stack of piled crates, Poros might see a tail protruding. A cat\u2019s tail- a reddish brown, overly large one, at that. It twitches and swings about slightly, suggesting that the attached body is in motion. \u201cJust a moment,\u201d a female voice chimes out from behind the crates. There is some minor rustling from behind the crates, before the source of the voice steps out into view. It is, as one may have assumed, Madame Naoki. She stands there, arms piled high with scrolls. She is wearing a fine maroon blouse- the color of the Isranian flag, and a long black skirt. Considering Poros over the stack of scrolls, she greets him. \u201cAh! Mr. Welchion, I was expecting you. I am Madame Naoki, head of the Treasury Department. Have a seat, I\u2019ll be with you in a moment.\u201dWith a tilt of the head, she indicates one of the only clean surfaces in the room, that of a simple wooden chair, sitting before the room\u2019s singular desk, still piled high with documents. ", "1456393202000": "Before him, Poros would find a large number of tax returns, no two quite the same, each of them headed by the name of a local business and ended with a statement of the enclosed payment- which has already been separated and placed in the Treasury itself. It is obvious, even to the untrained eye, that the papers on the desk, and indeed, throughout most of the room, are completely disorganized, simply thrown in with no regard given to their placement. However, one corner of the room is slowly beginning to see change. Madame Naoki has been working, for the past few hours, to begin, at the very least, tidying up the state of affairs. A pair of bookshelves have had their contents indexed and roughly organized, contents stacked and ordered in some way. It is here that she deposits her armful of scrolls, glancing at the lettering on each one before sliding it into place on the shelves. After her load of scrolls has been safely deposited, she approaches the seat where Poros is seated, and considers the mess on the desk.\u201cLet\u2019s go ahead and slide this\u2026\u201d Standing on her toes to reach the top of the stack of crates- and inadvertently giving Poros quite the view as she does so, she takes an empty crate from the top, and deposits it unceremoniously to one side of the desk. Moving around to the opposite side of the desk, she seats herself in the chair, and with one great sweeping motion, she pushes the entire contents of the desk off to one side, toward the waiting crate, scrolls, books, and loose bits of paper all. Well. Some of it actually lands in the crate, at least. Briefly, she leans over, considering the mess on the floor, before dismissing it with a wave of her hand. Something to be dealt with later. She turns to face Poros, and extends her right hand across the newly cleared desk, presumably for shaking. \u201cAs I said, Madame Naoki, of the Treasury Department- even in this deplorable state it\u2019s in. It\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Mr. Welchion.\u201d", "1456396195000": "\u201cExcellent. This,\u201d she gestures around, referring to the creaking bookcases and general disarray that surrounds them, \u201c... is the treasury department. You are- presumably, here to obtain a job working for me, here, in the Treasury Department. However, before I go ahead and offer you a job, I\u2019m going to ask you a couple of questions to ensure you\u2019re the sort of person I\u2019m looking to hire, in that you have the appropriate skills, and would seem to be a reasonable candidate. Try to answer each of my inquires with as much detail as you think would be relevant.\u201dReaching a hand into the pouch on her hip, Naoki extracts a small gemstone to sate her perpetual habit. A bit of tear-cut emerald, about three centimeters long. She idly begins to twist and turn it between the fingers of her left hand as she continues, keeping the gem in constant motion. If Poros is exceptionally magically attuned, he may sense tinglings of power in the gem. \u201cLet\u2019s start with something relatively basic; tell me about yourself. Where you\u2019re from, what sorts of skills and talents you have, that sort of thing.\u201d", "1456402417000": "As Poros speaks, Madame Naoki listens, and nods occasionally, always keeping at least one ear trained forward.\u201cFair enough, fair enough. That\u2019s exactly the sort of experience I\u2019m looking for- experience in practical business on the most basic level. Most of the positions I have in mind all require that sort of knowledge, so it\u2019s good that you\u2019ve got it. Not all of your past experiences will apply, in that you\u2019re probably not going to be actually selling things to people, but financial skills are financial skills, and that\u2019s great.\u201dShe spends a moment in thought before continuing.\u201cHm. I\u2019m going to go ahead and say this. Assuming what you\u2019ve already said is true, and seeing as how you\u2019re hardly one of many when it comes to candidates, it is safe to say at this point that I\u2019m going to offer you employment today. I don\u2019t really think many- if any more qualified candidates are going to come along, and I can\u2019t put this show on myself. I\u2019m not left with much of a choice, and you seem agreeable enough. However, I\u2019m going to go ahead with more questions, just because I\u2019m curious. That, and it would be beneficial for us both to know each other a bit better before setting about our task of building the greatest economy this world has ever seen. After I\u2019m done, you can go ahead and ask a few questions of your own.\u201dShe sits there for a moment, contemplating what she might ask next. A great multitude of interview questions lie in her arsenal, she\u2019s done this before for each and every Midnight Sun Employee, it is only a matter of choosing the correct- or rather, most interesting ones to ask now.\u201cAh, here\u2019s a big one. What would you like to ultimately become? What is your largest goal, or in what direction would you like to take your life?\u201d", "1456437408000": "Madame Naoki nods once again, satisfied with his answer, digesting what was and wasn't said. \u201cFair enough, that\u2019s an admirable goal to have, to become great in your own right. That should be pretty easy, if you\u2019re to be working with me on this. As you can see, the Treasury is in a... less than optimal state. I was appointed last week by Lord Ildesias, and it is my intention to not only make the Treasury Department a respected and effective subgroup of government, but also to do a number on this nation\u2019s economy. I- we- the Treasury Department, have a lot of responsibilities; including, but not limited to, trade regulation, taxes, the finances of the government, funding the armies, the possible creation of a national currency, the handling of government documents, such as citizenship and immigration papers, and dealing with other groups and nations to establish government sanctioned trade routes. I intend, with this authority I have, to lead Isra to greater economic and cultural prosperity than the world has ever seen.\u201dStanding, she moves over to a small pile of items near the door. Visibly, one would be able to see some paperwork, a personal bag, and a small collection of fine writing supplies.This is her personal stack of items, separate from the disarray of the office. Without a proper surface to set them on, they sit quietly on an upturned crate. Bending over again, she begins to sort through the paperwork, attempting to locate a particular form in the stack, tail swaying slightly as she does so. Still facing downward, she speaks again, raising her voice slightly to be heard as she faces away. \u201cThat\u2019s enough of my questioning for the time being; we\u2019ll have plenty of opportunities to chat later. To finalize your employment, there\u2019s going to be a bit of paperwork. You mentioned that you already live in Isra, and I assume you\u2019ve brought your citizenship paperwork with you, so we just need to do these\u2026 bits\u2026 here. Yes.\u201d Having selected a few documents from her stack, Naoki straightens, and strides over to place them on the desk before Poros. They are fairly standard documents of employment, and ask such questions as name, date of birth, place of residence, those standard sorts of questions. Also some contracts and agreements, non-disclosure, anti-embezzlement and anti-corruption sorts of papers, stating that the signee agrees not to take unlawful actions with their station and the like. Moving back over to her pile of things, Naoki selects a quill and small bottle of ink, which she then places next to the pile of forms. Finished with this, she leans up against the desk, turning to face Poros, arms partially crossed over her chest. \u201cThose are the documents will need to be filled out before you can be technically employed. Some of them are mandated for all government employees, some of them are for my own record keeping of this department. Once completed, and signed by all relevant parties, you will be employed as a member of The Treasury Department. Those documents don\u2019t mention anything regarding the work you\u2019re to be doing, or what your job description is to be, we can work that out later, if that\u2019s alright with you. You will, as part of your employment, receive the benefits listed on this paper here, be paid\u2026\u201dTaking the quill, Naoki leans over and writes a number in one of the blanks on the forms. It is a generous salary, and would presumably be raised later. \u201c\u2026 This much- and will be provided with government identification, too. In addition to that, will you need any other accommodations, or perhaps a place of residence? You mentioned working with your father, I presume you currently live with him. If your current place of residence is too far away, not conducive to you doing work from home, or in any other way distasteful, I am capable of providing you with quarters- either here in the Citadel, or elsewhere.You\u2019ll be expected to commute here essentially every day, so if you need someplace closer, that\u2019s definitely something I can do.\u201d", "1456449063000": "\u201cOf course, that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m offering. I understand your motivations, and would be happy to assist however I can, and if that means finding you a place to stay, then so be it.\u201dTaking the completed documents, she obtains her own quill, seats herself across the desk, a checking to ensure that Poros has filled out all the necessary blanks, and filling in her own portions. \u201cThere are a few more matters that need to be attended to before you can begin work. I need to finish these papers, fill out a few of my own, and get the whole mess approved by The Assembly. That process shouldn\u2019t take long, but technically you aren\u2019t allowed to begin working with government documents until then. However, there are a couple things we can do that I\u2019d like to get done and inform you of today.\u201d\u201cOne thing we should definitely attend to is the arrangements surrounding your residence. I believe that there are some apartment sorts of things here in The Citadel itself, that you probably have the option of using, or alternatively, we could find you a place out in the city. As something of a business magnate, I own a lot of land in the city, and we could easily find you someplace to stay. Some nice little house in the nice part of town, perhaps. We can do that today, if you'd like.\u201dFinished with her portion of the documents for now, and having found everything to be in order, Madame Naoki straightens the papers, and files them away into a folder, which she places back with her items near the door. From the door, she turns back to face Poros, and continues speaking. Her tone remains light and conversational, but her tail sways and twitches in what might be interpreted as a mischievous manner.\u201cAdditionally, I\u2019d like to- as is my habit when meeting someone new, offer to treat you to dinner. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve ever had the pleasure of dining at The Midnight Sun or Moonlight Eclipse, but I am of the (perhaps biased) opinion that we serve the finest food in the city. However, before any of that, I promised you the opportunity to ask me some questions. If you have any now, please feel free to ask away, or save them for later- for dinner, if you\u2019d like.\u201d", "1456488433000": "\u201cWe should be able to start tomorrow. All that needs to be done is for me to have a few people sign off on these papers, which I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be willing to do swiftly. And yes, I own The Midnight Sun, and its sister establishment, The Moonlight Eclipse. I own and manage both establishments and the organization of the same name.\u201dShe holds up her left hand, displaying the back of her palm, and the signet ring on her finger. There is but a single ring bearing The Midnight Sun\u2019s symbol, and Naoki regularly uses it to stamp documents and seals as a mark of authenticity in lieu of a signature. It is also a mark of her leadership, similar to how dukes and lords sometimes wear signet rings for the same purposes. Obviously, instead of a duchy or dominion, Madame Naoki instead controls an empire of the business variety.\u201cAs for the cat stuff, let me just go ahead and address this now. I have these ears, and this tail. Both features are fully functional and quite fuzzy. You can have a closer look if you\u2019d like, and I'm not opposed to the concept of some petting at a later date, but they are -as near as anyone can tell- essentially physical features that you might usually find on a housecat, except they\u2019re on me, and I\u2019m not a housecat. As you\u2019ve obviously noticed by this point, I have holes tailored into my clothing to allow my tail to swing freely.\u201dTurning about to face away from Poros, Naoki bends over slightly, waving her backside slightly to display the mentioned hole. It is a small, hemmed hole in her skirt, just above the waist, from which her tail protrudes. If Poros could see her face, he would be witness to the smirkiest of smirks; she is enjoying herself, toying with him in this way.\u201cI also don\u2019t generally wear hats, as they tend to interfere with my ears in a rather uncomfortable way. I don\u2019t have any fangs, whiskers, or any other cat-features beyond the ears and tail.\u201dTo showcase this, she stands upright once again, approaches Poros, and flashes her best smile, even going so far as to wink as she does so. Indeed, there aren\u2019t any fangs in her mouth, simply regular, well-cared-for teeth, and no whiskers are visible on her cheeks. Before anyone gets any ideas, she moves back, and seamlessly transitions into answering his business query, tone swiftly shifting to match the more serious topic. \u201cThe very first thing we\u2019re going to be doing is sorting this all out.\u201dRaising her hands, she gestures to the mounds of paperwork that surround them. \u201cThis is the accumulated financial documentation of Isra over the four years of its existence. We need to sort through it, categorize, and organize it all into a way that makes it useable for us. The government owes some people money, and is itself owed money by the people. We need to obtain all of the information we can from these documents, and create a functional understanding of what we have to work with. Who owes who what, and the true state of the nation\u2019s economy as it stands before we begin the bulk of our work.\u201dWalking over to take her bag from the pile near the door, she places it on the desk, and continues to speak as she peers into it, ensuring she has everything she needs.\u201cFrom there, the next thing we should do is create a system- a series of connected systems, for keeping track of information within the Department here. We\u2019re going to be collecting and processing a massive amount of data, and it would be nice not to have to do it all by hand. To help with this, I think that we might go and approach the mages of The Conjunction, and ask them to assist us by creating some magical artifacts and devices for our use. There are all sorts of things that talented magical practitioners and artificers can do to a book and quill and it would be very convenient for us to have magical ledgers that sort themselves onto shelves, and quills that write of their own volition.\u201dTaking the near pile of completed documents, Naoki carefully tucks them into the bag, still speaking.\u201cNext, after we\u2019re finished establishing ourselves, we will need to go and collect the information we don\u2019t have. We don\u2019t know how many people, exactly, live in the city, what their holdings are, or what they should be paying in taxes. This makes it impossible to accurately tax anything. So we\u2019re going to do a massive census of the whole city. Go around, figure out what everyone has, and record it in our ledger.\u201d\u201cThen, we\u2019d cooperate with Ildesias and the Assembly to create some reasonable tax codes approved by the rest of the government. The ones we\u2019re currently operating under are very vague and don\u2019t take a lot of things into account that I think they should. There\u2019s a lot of leniency in collection, and nobody really checks to see if everyone is paying the correct amount. A complete reform of the tax system is required,  so we\u2019re going to do that. Also budgets. The government is currently operating without a budget of any sort. That needs to change as soon as possible, and it\u2019s our job to do that.\u201dIt's evident, as she continues, that she's put a lot of thought into this, and is vocalizing plans she had conceived previously. \u201cBeyond that, there are also a lot of smaller and side projects I\u2019d like to work on, like reformatting and expanding upon the citizenship process, creating trade pacts with other nations, and instituting beneficial economic policies, but those sorts of things will have to wait until we\u2019ve gotten the Treasury Department into a reasonable state, and until we have time to do them. I realize that this seems all like a very daunting task- and don\u2019t misunderstand me, it most definitely is, but we\u2019re going to do it, and make it work. It\u2019s going to take a while, and it\u2019s going to be difficult, but I\u2019m going to see it done to a satisfactory level of completions, and am happy to have your assistance in doing so.\u201dMadame Naoki nods to Poros, an indication of respect.\u201cNow, unless you have anything else you\u2019d like to mention before we depart, let\u2019s do so and be on our way. There\u2019s a lot to do, so we should get started, starting with finding you a place to live. Like I mentioned, I own a lot of property around the city, and I have a few places in mind you might find suitable. After you.\u201dHolding the door open, she gestures to the hallway, and will proceed to follow Poros out of The Citadel, making a few brief stops to drop off the paperwork with the relevant parties.[Exit Citadel with Poros Welchion, to his new place of residence.]", "1459358571000": "Early in the morning, Madame Naoki arrives once again to the Treasury Offices. After seeing her inside, Artemis departs on a minor errand, leaving Naoki alone with the mounds of unsorted documents. After taking a moment to deposit her belongings on the surface of the singular desk and roll up her sleeves, Naoki proceeds directly to work, picking up directly where she left off the following evening. Identifying, sorting, categorizing, alphabetizing. It\u2019s hardly the most thrilling work, and lends easily to boredom, but it is quite an informative experience. Going through everyone\u2019s tax returns tends to tell you a lot about people, she\u2019s finding, and Naoki quite likes to learn about people. She continues to work until someone else, perhaps Poros Welchion\u00a0or Artemis\u00a0enter. ", "1460394036000": "Madame Naoki turns as Poros enters the room, a single rolled scroll held in one hand. She returns his nod of greeting, though with slightly less enthusiasm. \u201cAh, Poros, good to see you. Alphabetize the contexts of those two piles onto that shelf by last name of submitter, if you would.\u201dUsing the scroll as a pointer, Naoki indicates the piles of documents and shelf she\u2019s referring to. \u201cThose are all of the tax returns submitted in the first year of The Free City\u2019s operation. At this point, they\u2019re essentially useless to us, so we\u2019re not going to bother organizing them further quite yet. By the time you\u2019re finished with that, I\u2019ll probably be finished sorting out the second year\u2019s returns, and then we can sort those.\u201d", "1460494833000": "After she sees Poros started on his task, Naoki returns her gaze to the bookshelf before her, though her focus is elsewhere. Her hands move systematically, silently and efficiently sorting the documents from the shelf into piles. Though the paper pass before her eyes, she does truly see them, or retain the information contained within for longer than is necessary to make the binary decision of which pile to sort them into. Presently, she remembers the tea, and seats herself in the room\u2019s chair. Her eyes drill into a spot on the floor as she takes sip after sip. Soon enough, the teacup is drained, and Naoki only realizes after attempting to sip twice to no avail. Absently, she returns the empty cup to its saucer on the desk and rises to return to her sorting. Though she is aware of his presence, Poros\u2019 glares go unnoticed, Naoki simply continues to function, sorting document after document. All the while, her earring glimmers and shines incessantly, purple light occasionally playing across whatever years-old tax return she\u2019s considering. ", "1460675114000": "As Artemis calls out, Naoki is roused to a state of full alertness. The glimmering of her earring slows noticeably, her ears swiveling to face Artemis and Poros. She glances between the two, and mentally catches up to the state of the conversation. A troubling development, yes, but Artemis had already asked the important question. All that\u2019s left for Naoki to do is look to Poros for his answer. ", "1539618146000": "In an otherwise undramatic entrance, The Empress follows the Sentinel into the room. She\u2019s wearing one of her everyday sweaterdresses, and isn\u2019t exuding as much Imperial Grace as she possibly could this morning.Because today is a gold day, when Naoki returns to The Offices of The Treasury Department to fulfill her duties as Minister of Finance. Ever since being appointed by Lord Ildesias years ago she has never relinquished the post, preferring instead to continue managing Isra\u2019s economy herself. With her background in business and knowledge of the systems in place, there is no one more qualified, and she feels that being aware of how the money moves enables her to make better decisions as Empress. That, and \u201cHe who holds the purse strings, rules the house, the nation, the world.\u201d By holding the strings personally, Naoki removes the possibility of embezzlement, corruption, and being undermined by her treasurer\u2014she knows exactly how easy that is. And today, as she can see, she is joined by Lord Arthur Perceval, of The East Isran Trading Company. Profit from trade has increased massively since the formation of The Company, by virtue of it being The Company\u2019s primary responsibility. Perceval can give the matter his undivided attention where Naoki cannot, and a large, organized fleet such as The Company's outperforms private merchants in every way. The Company has a large degree of autonomy, and Lord Perceval has quickly built a large amount of influence, but so far it seems like he knows which way the wind blows. Which is, of course, whichever damn way The Empress says it blows. \u201cGreetings,\u201d The Empress raises a hand in greeting and moves past to seat herself at the large table in the rear of the room. The table is bare for now but won\u2019t stay that way for long. \u201cHow has the past month gone?\u201d ", "1539656993000": "The Empress accepts the pile of papers and gives them a preliminary scan, reading the titles and totals down at the bottom. It seems more or less like what she was expecting, but she\u2019ll come back to them later. After straightening the pile, she sets it aside and nods to Perceval.\u201cGood. I\u2019m pleased that things seem to be proceeding smoothly; this seems like a healthy rate of growth and I would rather this to any large shifts.\u201dAs The Empress is speaking, a pageboy enters carrying a ledger, some papers, and a few scrolls. He sets these on the table near The Empress and leaves to fetch the next load.\u201cI\u2019d like to talk to you about this, though.\u201d In a smooth segue, Naoki takes one of the scrolls and rolls it across to Perceval. It details a trade agreement.\u201cThe Foreign Service chaps whipped this up following my trip to Audria two weeks ago. To spare you the drama, Konrad has declared independence from The Vessian Empire and threw a feast in an attempt to gain allies. Few nations turned up; fewer made any sort of agreement. I was the only one who decided to open trade with Audria, which puts us in a very advantageous position.\u201dAnother one of the scrolls unrolls into a map, which The Empress spreads across the center of the table. \u201cAudria\u2019s city, Salem, is here. Previously, they used a route something like\u2026 this, to trade with Vessia, over there. However, with that no longer being an option, they\u2019re forced to trade with us if they\u2019d like to have sugar in their tea. We\u2019ll do as we please with the prices\u2014just as Vessia did, but there is the small matter of the mountains.\u201dOn the map, The Norkari and Saskatoon Mountains create an excellent natural border between Isra and the northern lands where Audria is located.\u201cI took a path like this,\u201d The Empress continues, tracing a line through The Saskatoon Mountains with her finger. \u201cWe were able to get through\u2014it\u2019s better than going around, but it was a difficult journey. Up to the mountains was fine, but there\u2019s no road through the mountains or through the marsh. I suspect it simply won\u2019t be practical for caravans to visit Audria, as Salem doesn\u2019t have anything we can\u2019t get elsewhere, and there are quicker, easier, and more reliable routes. Are you following?\u201d", "1539730170000": "The Empress grins, pleased that he caught on. \u201cYou guessed it.\u201d\u201cI want an outpost up here, somewhere on the north coast, and it will be the task of The Company to see it done. Choose a location that is defensible with room to expand. Think ten years ahead, about how the humble outpost may be developing into a city. Because while its primary function will be to facilitate trade with Audria, having an outpost in the north will also expand the range of our navies, resulting in more voyages to the north, and making trade with, say, Tawakoshi, that much more viable.\u201d\u201cWith that intent stated, I will leave the rest of the decision-making to you. I\u2019m unsure how difficult the winter may make things, but I would like this project to proceed as quickly as it safely can.\u201d", "1539834459000": "The Empress nods. \u201cI appreciate your efficiency, Commander.\u201dRealizing how that may have come across, she adds, \u201cBut don\u2019t rush it. Having this outpost sooner rather than later isn\u2019t worth any Isran lives.\u201dMaking eye contact, The Empress conveys to Perceval that she\u2019ll be more upset with accidents than delays; there\u2019s enough weight on her conscience already, and she doesn\u2019t give half a damn about the sugar in Audrian tea.\u201cSend me updates on its progress directly, and enjoy the rest of your day, Commander.\u201d She nods, dismissing him.", "1556762273000": "Despite what might be assumed, the gold itself is handled elsewhere, and The Offices of The Treasury Department are just that: offices. Intended to house the bean-counters responsible for Isra\u2019s taxes, it is a building used to keep the rain off the paperwork and little more. The rows of desks are mostly vacant. Only a few workers toil away through the afternoon, doing calculations, alphabetizing, and checking to ensure the numbers add up. At the far end of the room, a single large desk sits facing the others, and it is here that The Empress is seated. As Kargth enters, she looks up, puts down her quill, and removes the reading glasses she had been wearing. She makes a token effort to move her work out of the way.\u201cYou\u2019re the northerner here to discuss a trade deal,\u201d The Empress states, looking him up and down. Count on northerners to be big, she supposes.\u201cPardon the mess, have a seat and introduce yourself.\u201d She gestures to the chair opposite her, which will hopefully be capable of supporting her guest\u2019s weight.

She quirks one eyebrow at the mention of \u201cillegal things,\u201d but is otherwise placid. \u201cI see,\u201d she says, shifting in her seat. There are several reasons The Empress isn\u2019t immediately warm to the idea of trading with this fellow, but she\u2019s not one to dismiss matters out of hand. There\u2019s more to this than he\u2019s shared, and she considers how to launch her queue of inquiries.Her first question, \u201cYou speak another language?\u201d", "1556786392000": "\u201cHmmh.\u201d A huge amnesiac in full plate has come to sell her strange trees. \u2026 It isn't the most bizarre thing to happen this week.\u201cFair enough,\u201d The Empress waves a hand. \u201cThere are some I understand, is why I ask.\u201d\u201cIn any case, if you\u2019ve brought some of these strong trees with you, you must have brought them through the mountain pass...\u201d She trails off, considering. \u201cYou\u2019ve experienced the difficulty involved with moving material goods through the mountains firsthand, and considering that, I\u2019m unsure if this would be a good deal for you,\u201d she muses. \u201cBut you probably don\u2019t have but so many options. If your soil is so different as all that, I would assume agriculture would be difficult, and you can\u2019t sustain a population of any size on hunting and gathering alone. Maybe fishing is an option, but if you\u2019ve come this far with the idea of selling this lumber, let\u2019s entertain the notion.\u201d\u201cI suppose I\u2019ll go inspect your lumber in a moment but riddle me this: if the wood is so hard, how do you work it, and what do you use it for?\u201d", "1556793711000": "Listening, The Empress nods every so often, building her mental picture of these lands. \u201cWell,\u201d she begins, \u201cWhile you may not be able to sail the river, what might help quite a bit would be for an Isran trade ship to anchor at the mouth of your river and send barges to pick up the logs at your port. If they know what\u2019s good for them, the bandits won\u2019t bother my ships, and if they\u2019re not, they\u2019ll learn quickly. It would likely take a concentrated military effort to clear them out properly\u2014and maybe we will\u2014but as long as the barges don\u2019t get in their way, they ought to leave well enough alone.\u201d Even though she learned of this region mere minutes before, The Empress speaks as one entirely confident in her ability to strongarm whatever variety of bandits these may be.\u201cAnd, if we\u2019re to send barges down the river anyway, they could be loaded with the grain you need, as opposed to hauling it back in your cart, out on the open road.\u201d She gestures in the general direction of the mountains, implying such a thing would carry an element of danger.\u201cIt depends on how much of this wood you intend to sell and how much Isran involvement you\u2019d like in your region. I don\u2019t know how things work there; it could be such that sending escorted barges in that manner would prompt them to assault your camp. If you would prefer to tote logs through the mountains, that\u2019s your decision to make, but if we\u2019re to be trading, I\u2019m willing to invest at least that much to ensure the goods get there safely.\u201d Turning her palms up, The Empress does a shrug of sorts, indicating that she\u2019s flexible and open to suggestions. ", "1556922597000": "The Empress murmurs appreciatively in response. \u201cI see.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m unsure how familiar you are with Isra\u2019s policies, but we harbor no softness for the likes of slavers. It will be very doable to support your efforts.\u201d Though she speaks professionally in the third person, a touch of something personal seeps into The Empress\u2019s tone. With that said, she nods. \u201cVery good. The specifics of price and the garrison can be worked out between yourself and whoever the relevant officers turn out to be. \u2026 Do you have a name that you prefer?\u201d", "1557036593000": "\u201cVery good. A pleasure to meet you, Kargth, and good travels.\u201d Nodding, The Empress dismisses him and reseats herself. When Kargth mentions undead, The Empress looks over and nods knowingly. That\u2019s why his helmet stayed on. \u201cMany of my closest friends are undead,\u201d she replies. \u201cIsra, The Free City, is open to all who obey her laws, and her laws protect beings of all types.\u201dThere\u2019s a pause before she continues. \u201cThat said, there are those Israns who are less tolerant \u2014 first among them, Archbishop Alured Norian , and his Church of Varafel. Tall elf, dark robes, wide hat, mask with a beak. \u2018Speaks like this,\u2019\u201d The Empress performs an excellent impersonation of a male voice muffled by a mask but breaks into a short coughing fit afterward.She composes herself before continuing. \u201cHe and his disciples may be best avoided. The Guard upholds Law in the street, but aren\u2019t omnipotent. I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have any trouble, but probably best to keep the helmet on regardless.\u201d", "1571032435000": "Empress Naoki sits alone in The Offices of The Treasury Department, spectacles perched on the very end of her nose. Her eyes flit up and down the parchment she\u2019s scanning, deep in thought. At one point, there was theoretically some manner of reason as to how things were arranged, but that was some hours ago and things have since devolved. On the desk before her now is a mess of scrolls, ledgers, miscellaneous documents, and bits of scrap parchment covered in varying numbers of numbers. Because today is Gold Day, and The Empress has spent the better part of the morning reviewing The Empire\u2019s aggregate financial records from the last quarter. Earlier there was a break for brunch, but now she\u2019s back it, reviewing, tabulating, analyzing, and making sure all of the numbers add up in the way she\u2019d like them to.Managing the finances of the entire Empire is a herculean task, and arguably not one The Empress Herself should be burdened with. Though the Treasury Department\u2019s staff handles much of the tedium, The Empress has refused to appoint a Treasurer or delegate the task to someone like Robert, insisting on doing it herself. Because way back when, once upon a time, Madame Naoki was The Free City\u2019s Treasurer \u2014 and The Empress is not so foolish as to relinquish the purse strings she herself pulled to gain control of the state. Gold is society\u2019s lifeblood; controlling how the gold flows in The Empire is to control The Empire itself \u2014 Gold is the essence of power. To appoint a Treasurer \u2014 even a trustworthy one, would be to cede much of her power as Empress and make a coup that much more plausible.No, The Empress balances the books herself and likes it that way. Right now, that means reviewing The Enclave\u2019s proposed budget. It\u2019s four times what it was last year, and she suspects that to be a bit egregious, even considering their recent restructuring.As she is considering the bulk purchase of alchemical reagents, Naoki\u2019s ears perk at the sound of footsteps in the hallway. She removes her spectacles, and when the pageboy knocks, she bids he enter.His message: \u201cKeph is here.\u201dNaoki\u2019s eyebrows rise in surprise; she wasn\u2019t sure if Keph would return or not. He certainly has the very best of reasons to, but Naoki admits she may have gone the slightest bit beyond what might be considered reasonable during their last meeting, and she wouldn\u2019t have blamed him for fleeing Isra as soon as he could walk straight. The fact that Keph has returned is very interesting indeed \u2014 a pleasant surprise.The fact that he is here now is less immediately pleasing; she\u2019s right in the middle of this. She has no reservations about having him wait like any other guest, but this will take the rest of the day. Empress or no, that\u2019s colder than Naoki would like to be toward Keph. The rest of the work will keep until tomorrow, but she at least needs to finish what she's doing.After a moment more of consideration, The Empress decides. \u201cBring him here, would you?\u201dThe pageboy blinks once before nodding. \u201cYes, milady.\u201d It is unusual that she would receive a guest in such a place, but then Keph is not a usual sort of guest.After the pageboy leaves, Naoki replaces her spectacles and picks up where she left off... with a request for fifty barrels of pixie dust. (Just what do they intend to do with all that?!) ", "1572233712000": "Naoki sits ready to greet Keph as he comes in, but he immediately turns around and leaves. She blinks. A moment later he peers around the edge of the door and knocks. And that is absolutely too much, for Naoki, sending her into a brief fit of laughter.But she recovers quickly and beckons him in. \u201cCome in, come in! \u2014 Hello, Keph \u2014 sit, sit sit sit.\u201d Waving him into a chair, Naoki nudges the door almost shut with her foot.Then she gets a proper look at him. \u2026There\u2019s a long pause as Naoki attempts to parse Keph\u2019s new getup. He\u2019s got\u2026 His jacket, yes, his cloak, sure, and then a mask spiked on his shoulder, and a bunch of feathers, and also a bandolier of... eggs?Naoki murmurs something noncommittal, unsure what to think. \u201cThat\u2019s... quite the outfit you\u2019ve got there.\u201dBut before she can get too far into her analysis, Naoki is distracted by the pen. \u201cOooh, look at that\u2026!\u201d\u201cIf Keph isn\u2019t using paper anymore, I\u2019ll have to find something else to give for Yuletide,\u201d she teases, craning her head to marvel at the floating letters. It\u2019s not quite the flashiest magic The Empress has ever seen, but the context makes it worthy of an appreciative hum. She then reads it, mouthing the words as she deciphers right to left.\"... Interesting bureaucratic things. Yes. These are Isra\u2019s finances. Every copper that passed though Imperial hands in the last few months is recorded here, somewhere, theoretically.\u201d Waving irreverently at the surrounding mess, she doesn\u2019t seem prepared to back up that claim. \u201cI\u2019m reviewing things to make sure all the numbers add up how I'd like them to, that there's no egregious spending, embezzling, or anything like that. You've caught me right in the middle, and it\u2019s going to take me a short bit to finish this part, but afterward... You\u2019ll have my full attention,\u201d Naoki promises, fixing Keph with a look.\u201cKeph could go wait somewhere else if he\u2019d like, or you could stay here, and we could \u2018chat.\u2019 I\u2019m curious to hear what Keph has been up to and to have the opportunity to squeeze you for tales of adventure. Most anything Keph has to say will be more interesting than this expense report, easily.\u201d", "1572571660000": "Reading Keph\u2019s response, Naoki nods and dons her spectacles. \u201cIn that case, while you\u2019re sitting there, think about what we might like to do today.\u201d\u201cSomething fun. Something novel. Somewhere to go, something to see, an activity to do. All doors are open to The Empress, so while I\u2019m doing this, you come up with some ideas. This shouldn\u2019t take very long...\u201d Having said that, Naoki busies herself in the paperwork, keen to finish in a timely manner.Several moments pass in silence save for the occasional ruffling of papers.\"We could go to the Sudatorium,\" she suggests without looking up, \"Or just as easily, the Baths.\"\"We could visit the Oculus Solis \u2014 I believe they're doing races today. ... Or we could go have a picnic somewhere. Or go sailing. Or flying,\" she says, gesturing with her quill. \"That might be enjoyable.\"", "1573320714000": "\u201cSailing!\u201d Naoki repeats, seemingly pleased with the choice. \u201cKeph has good taste!\u201dA few moments pass in silence as Naoki notices and corrects a mistake in her addition, silently mouthing the digits.\u201cI\u2019m glad you chose that,\u201d she muses, re-checking her work. \u201cThough I quite enjoy sailing, there\u2019s nowhere in particular for me to sail to, and I don\u2019t mean to develop a reputation as the sort of wasteful, hedonistic, layabout who embarks an entire flotilla of naval vessels for no other reason than to feel the gentle breeze of the sea ruffle her ears.\u201d\u201cBut to entreat a suitor to an afternoon on the water\u2026!\u201d Naoki wags a finger at Keph.  \u201cThat\u2019s far easier to justify.\u201dFlipping over her scrap paper, Naoki spends a moment to write out a note. Should Keph care to read, it would (upside down, in The Empress\u2019s slanting script) read nothing more than as follows:Please have The Indulgence readied, small escort.\u201cIf you would, please,\u201d she says, handing the folded note to Keph, \u201cGive this to Thomas \u2014 my page, out in the hall. I won\u2019t be very much longer, and in the time it\u2019ll take us to reach the port, they\u2019ll have everything ready to go.\u201d", "1442548158000": "Down the main boulevard, Madame Naoki and Artemis approach the great walls of The Citadel. Madame Naoki walks in front, wearing a black gown with long black gloves. Artemis follows close behind to the right, carrying a small, nondescript bag.

We're here to do some reading in the archives.\"", "1442611455000": "At the guard's denial, Naoki bites her lip and pouts a bit. \"Do we look like the general public to you, sweetie?

It stops, a respectable distance away down the road, parking up against a building, and discharges its occupants down the ladder in the rear.

By some miracle of scheduling, it may happen to be the same guard Naoki spoke with when she visited the Citadel last. \u201cHello! It\u2019s me, again. We\u2019ve got a couple of things to take care of in the Citadel today. Need to submit some tax paperwork and such. Here\u2019s our identification.\u201d She presents to the guard her legitimate identification paperwork, as well as that of Artemis and Cyronin. Gesturing to Skarlet, she speaks again.\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have any paperwork yet, that\u2019s another one of the reasons we\u2019re here.

Behind them, within the carriage, Stan takes a sandwich from within his seat, and begins to dig into the wonders that are roasted pork as he idly watches the guards change shifts. ", "1476032564000": "On a bright, sunny, and somewhat chilly Thursday afternoon, just after lunch, Madame Naoki stands just inside the gate of The Citadel. On this fine afternoon, she seems to have located yet another sweaterdress to wear, this one a bright red, with ornamentation on the shoulders and sleeves. Where she\u2019s getting all of these sweaterdresses is anyone\u2019s guess. Here, she awaits the arrival of Alden Marshal and his children, having previously promised a tour of The Citadel. Though Little Naoki is almost guaranteed to show, Naoki knows not which- if any, of Alden\u2019s other children, might choose to come. The brothers are probably a good bet, she supposes. The Citadel, in addition to being the seat of government, is of course also home to the Dawn Riders and a fair portion of Isra\u2019s military infrastructure. However, Naoki supposes that however many of them come, they\u2019re probably going to be a handful and begins to contemplate procedures she might implement to make the tour go smoothly for all involved.", "1476818453000": "Though Naoki is aware of the approaching children and does her best to prepare- turning one foot to the side and bracing for impact, she still finds herself unprepared, staggering as Little Naoki very nearly tackles her. \u201cI did, I did\u2026\u201d Naoki assures and attempts to placate her assailant with head pats. As the other children, Alden, and Thaelyn all approach and offer their gratitude, Naoki nods in response, and responds, \u201cWell, you\u2019re all very welcome- it\u2019s my pleasure, but I also haven\u2019t started yet.\u201d Offering a slight shrug, she adds, \u201cI request that all thank-you-hugs be saved for after the tour.\u201d\u201cHowever!\u201d Raising a single finger to point into the air, Naoki waits until she has everyone\u2019s attention before continuing, \u201cBefore we can begin, there are a few things that must be understood. First and foremost, this is The Citadel. Inside, government workers, politicians, and soldiers are all working, and the majority of their work is absolutely essential to the continued well-being of the state- very important! As such, our tour cannot disturb them, so you should all conduct yourselves carefully and respectfully.\u201d\u201cFurthermore, this is The Citadel. It\u2019s one of the biggest buildings in the world, and it\u2019s very easy to get lost inside, especially in the underground portions. I\u2019ll admit, I myself have lost my way inside before, on a few occasions. As such, you should stay very close to an adult at all times. Either your father, Ms. Thaelyn or myself. If you do get lost, you should, first of all, stop moving. If you wander too far, it will take longer to find you. Secondly, if you see someone who works here, you should- if you would feel comfortable doing so, approach them, state that you are a guest of Lady Naoki\u2019s, and request their assistance in finding your way back to the group.\u201dHonestly, between Alden and the possible assistance of Takhana, Naoki doesn\u2019t expect to have any issues with lost children but figures it prudent to give the advice anyway, on the off chance that it ends up being relevant at some point. Not to mention, simply giving the advice makes getting lost seem like a legitimate possibility, and serves to reinforce the suggestion that they stay close, which makes things that much easier.\u201cWith all of that in mind, let\u2019s start the tour right here.\u201d Pointing downward with two fingers to indicate the very ground beneath their feet, Naoki launches directly into it. \u201cThis is, as you might be able to guess, the gate of The Citadel.\u201d With a grand sweeping motion, she gestures to the structure of the gate towering above and around them. Each of the great doors is easily twenty meters tall, and though the doors stand agape, the whole thing lends itself easily to a feeling of silent, imposing strength.\u201cBack behind you,\u201d she continues, gesturing, \u201cthose steps you came up are very important. First of all- and most importantly, they keep my legs in shape, because I have to climb them each day to get to work. \u2026 Beyond that, they\u2019re also an important defensive measure. If anyone troublesome wanted to get into The Citadel, they would have to climb these stairs, which leaves them at the mercy of any archers up along the walls, up there.\u201d Pointing, Naoki indicates the crenelations high above, which are all but filled by soldiers, each maintaining a vigilant watch. Drawing the group\u2019s attention back downward, Naoki now indicates the Citadel Guards, standing at rapt attention to either side. While usually, they would only number perhaps twenty or so, today there must be at least double that, inside, outside, and around the gate. Some watch the group, others stare off down the steps, one fellow seems to be wrestling with deep-seated anxiety, and one guard even has the audacity to pick at her nose.\u201cThese fine men and women are members of The Citadel Guard, a special portion of Isra\u2019s military tasked with the important job of protecting The Citadel and ensuring the safety of those within. Specifically, these individuals are tasked with operating the gate, and making sure that only people who are supposed to can go through. And, as it so happens, we\u2019re loitering in the gate. So let\u2019s proceed inside- follow me.\u201dBeckoning, Naoki proceeds, intentionally moving more slowly than she might usually in consideration for little legs, and leaving her hands idle at her sides. ", "1476984445000": "\u201cMhm. In fact, when the founders arrived here before the city was built, there wasn\u2019t even a hill here.\u201dPausing for a moment, Naoki allows the impact of that statement to impress upon her smaller counterpart. \u201cAs I hear from those who witnessed it,\u201d Naoki continues, \u201cthe first Lord of the city, Ildesias Xen Torsal, formed a conjunction with forty-nine other mages. They sat in a circle around what would become the base of this hill, and wove \u2018A spell that will move stone and lumber and craft them together as though only the finest craftsmen and builders were working.\u2019\u201dNaoki\u2019s impersonation of Ildesias is, of course, on point, but still, she continues, \u201cIt was the first spell of its kind attempted on such a scale. Because it\u2019s one thing to build, a house, or a shed, or whatever, but it\u2019s entirely another to build something like this.\u201d As they step out into the courtyard, Naoki gestures around them. To every side, the towering architecture rises up around them. Though it has lost the majority of the novelty for Naoki, one can\u2019t deny that it\u2019s a damn impressive building, what with its spires, gates, fortifications, and purely ornamental statues. \u201cOver the course of a full day and night, Ildesias and the conjunction channeled immense amounts of mana into the spell, first raising this hill out of the land, and then utilizing stockpiled materials to build the structure you see today. As I hear, it was an amazing spectacle, to watch all of the  stones and bricks and such fly through the air and assemble themselves into the structure you see today. And if you\u2019ve ever seen a more mundane construction mage at work, you can sort of get a sense of what it must have been like\u2026 but still. I regret not being there to see it in person...\u201d\u201cAnd, to be fair, in the years since then, we haven\u2019t had to do much to change it. A few modernizations, regular maintenance, and repair, but otherwise The Citadel has been serving our needs well. We\u2019re only just now, with the increased size of the government, beginning to utilize the full extent of its facilities.\u201dWith this stated, Naoki opts to leave it at that for the moment, pausing off to one side of The Keep Hall\u2019s entrance to allow the group to look around and acquaint themselves with what\u2019s visible from the courtyard. All around them, individuals shuffle from place to place, in and out of the Keep Hall, toward The Enclave tower, and among the other various buildings and facilities. This flurry of activity is, of course, in preparation for the upcoming conflict, but Naoki doesn\u2019t feel the need to mention that to the children right now.", "1477109477000": "The response to Arya Shieldheart  comes swiftly and clearly, \u201cHello Ayra. Your visit is unexpected, but not unwelcome. I\u2019m a bit busy at the moment, but I\u2019ll go ahead and have you let in. Follow the guard, and I\u2019ll be with you as soon as I can.\u201dSimultaneously, Naoki responds telepathically to Jun of the Celadine  , \u201cHi Jun.

All around The Citadel and larger Isra, soldiers ready their armaments, government workers hurry to and fro carrying communications and supplies, lookouts scour the horizon, wary of a preemptive strike... and Naoki is giving a tour.Taking a slightly deeper breath to clear her mind, Naoki addresses the children, \u201cNo further questions then, I take it.

Once they're safely out of earshot, she remarks to Artemis, \"There's the benefits of magic for you, right there.\"Once they reach the lobby, Naoki stops, and takes a moment to take in the surroundings. It seemed to be mostly as she presumed a government mage order building might be like. Bookshelves, scrolls, tables, robed figures puttering about. She looks for any indicator of her destination, the Archives. A sign, a marked door, a staircase leading down, or failing that, someone who looked knowledgeable and impressionable enough to show her the way.

I'm Madame Naoki, and this is Artemis. We're here to learn; specifically about the laws of this Free City, as well as some basic magical techniques. As I understand, this would be the place for that sort of thing. Beyond that, I also hope, as someone of note, to meet some other people of note, and generally introduce myself around the Citadel in general.\"\"If I might ask, what's the protocol regarding entrance to this building? When I mentioned my intentions to the outer gate guard, he implied that this is a mostly closed.... community? Library? I don't know the appropriate term. And now you question my presence.

Thinking back to the first visit, she takes a moment to reflect on how things have progressed since then. A Minister, now, in charge of the Treasury Department. All here are her indirect subordinates. Part of her hopes that she might run into those two cranky mages from before, simply so that she can pull rank and flash her identification at them, but the rational part says that meeting with those two would be completely unproductive, and wishes to avoid an encounter. Regardless, finished with her ruminations, Naoki proceeds to the doors. Assuming them to still be unlocked, she proceeds inside, and takes stock of the interior of The Conjunction. It seems to be mostly unchanged since her last visit, as nearly as she can tell. After taking a moment to acquaint herself with the layout of the lobby, Naoki proceeds to whatever sort of reception desk or reasonably knowledgeable looking offical happens to be near to the door, and displays her identification. \u201cMadame Naoki, with the Treasury Department. I\u2019d like to speak with the acting director of The Conjunction, could you direct me?\u201d", "1459356757000": "\u201cAlright, fair enough, thank you.

Upon reaching any such door that might distinguish itself as being a plausible candidate for the Minister\u2019s office, she knocks, three short raps. ", "1471331972000": "On a relatively quiet but otherwise unremarkable summer afternoon, Lady Naoki makes her way through The Citadel toward The Enclave tower. She walks without any particular sense of hurry- the majority of her work for today is already done, all that remains is a meeting scheduled in another few hours. Without quite enough time to have a nap or go elsewhere to have a meal, Naoki figures that now is as good a time as any to do some of her personal research. With this in mind, she enters the Enclave Tower. One of Isra\u2019s foremost repositories of magical knowledge. As good a place as any to start, she figures. Past the towering double doors, past many robed practitioners of magic. Up a short flight of stairs. Past a section dedicated to magics elemental. Past a set of acolytes not-so-subtly sucking face behind a bookshelf without anything more than a smirk. After a short while, however, Naoki reaches her goal. The portion of The Enclave dedicated to magics of the mind. Scrying, telepathy, telekinesis, and all of their ilk. Another short while is spent perusing the shelves, selecting a small set of books that would seem to be as reasonable a place to start as any, pulling them off the shelves and forming a stack.With her stack of tomes, Naoki seats herself at a conveniently placed table presumably intended for just such a purpose, and begins to read. ", "1478212483000": "For the next stop on their tour, Madame Naoki leads Alden Marshal, his children, and Thaelyn Mortris to the Enclave Tower. Surpassed in height only by the titular \u201cThe Tower\u201d which houses Isra\u2019s military offices, The Enclave serves not only as home to many of the mages employed in service of the state, but also as their halls of study, their repositories of knowledge, and place of work. The entry hall of The Enclave is much like the foyer of a library, in that is a large, tall-ceilinged room whose walls are covered in bookcases and shelves. Directly ahead upon entering through the tall double doors, one would find a sort of reception desk, though it isn\u2019t tooled for reception as much as it is for assisting young acolytes in finding what resources they require. And indeed, there are a handful of relatively young individuals- presumably acolytes, standing at the desk, consulting their more veteran peers. One of them, a woman of apparently perhaps forty, makes a beckoning motion, and in response, a particular scroll dislodges itself from a bookcase some thirty feet overhead and floats its way down into her hand. She, in turn, hands it to the young man before her, who was presumably looking for it. All around, such casual displays of magic are practiced in such number and with such a blase attitude, lending a somewhat surreal factor to it. However, Naoki doesn\u2019t seem particularly impressed as she leads her group into the room, and off into a small area to one side of the main thoroughfare where they ought not to be in anyone\u2019s way. In fact, if anything, she seems vaguely smug, for whatever reason. After the entirety of her group is assembled and all tails are accounted for, Naoki begins with a sweeping gesture, \u201cThis,\u00a0is The Enclave- or The Conjunction\u00a0if you\u2019d prefer. It is the seat of magical power in Isra, where many of Isra\u2019s most talented magic users make their home and do their studies.\u201dHere, she stops to gauge initial reactions and ponder for a moment how best to proceed.", "1478486579000": "For a moment, Naoki attempts to stop the children from running about every which way, holding Little Naoki on her shoulders Truthfully, her first impressions of The Enclave have stuck, and as such, she still sort of considers the whole group of them to be cranky, aggressive sorts, liable to scold children just as they scolded her.But then Naoki realizes for the second time that they can\u2019t talk back to her anymore. Upon this realization, she abruptly ceases all efforts and deposits Little Naoki on the floor, chuckling to herself. Is it petty of her to unleash The Children on The Enclave for the behavior of two individuals years ago? Perhaps.Perhaps. But that\u2019s not stopping her. She only offers the tidbit, \u201cDon\u2019t break anything,\u201d before leaning back against a conveniently placed bookshelf with a smug sort of smirk. ", "1479224867000": "\u201cI\u2019m giving them a tour,\u201d she states, somewhat matter-of-factly. Evidently, Naoki doesn\u2019t feel the need to explain herself further to Vigil as she turns to observe the children as they spread about the room. Whether she observes out of concern for the children or simply for the amusement of watching the Enclave mages deal with them is left unanswered, but one may be able to make inferences based on how the corners of her mouth tilt upward. Apparently not opposed to allowing the mages to entertain the children for a while, Naoki addresses a question sidelong to Alden, \u201cWhat plans do you have for their continued education?\u201d ", "1479597864000": "Nodding slowly, Naoki hums a sort of \u201cMmmm,\u201d noise, intending to express acknowledgment and agreement. Beyond simply wanting the best for his children, he wants them to have it better than he did, and that\u2019s very admirable, she thinks.Standing there silently, Naoki ruminates for a few moments on her own parental challenges, and how she really probably should have found a tutor or five for Skarlet a long time ago. She and Alden both could do with a parent partner, neither of them really have the time to dedicate. But then\u2026 perhaps that\u2019s what Ms. Mortis is to become, Naoki muses as she turns to glance in the woman\u2019s direction.She certainly does seem like an excellent fit for such a job, Naoki thinks. Hell, she\u2019s probably already playing a fairly major role in the children's lives, even if not in name as a \u2018parent\u2019. Still, it doesn\u2019t seem the time to be asking after such things directly, so after a fair pause, Naoki launches another inquiry in Alden\u2019s direction. \u201cAnd what of yourself? How are you doing in terms of goals, aspirations, and such? Do you have anything in particular in mind, or just more of the same as the children grow?\u201d", "1479794087000": "\u201cMmmh.\u201d More murmurs of acknowledgment. \u201cPerhaps you should, though. The moment you stop considering your long-term future, you resign yourself to short-term planning, and fate.\u201d The last word is intoned with what could easily be interpreted as disgust. Afterward however, she offers a slight shrug, intending to suffix the whole line of questioning with a relaxed sort of air, and not make it seem as if she was going anywhere in particular with it. Standing there to one side, leaning against a bookcase, Naoki muses that it would be alright if Alden or Thaelyn had something in particular to say. But Alden is a quiet sort, and Thaelyn sort of has a sleeping child on her chest, she supposes. In any case, it\u2019s somewhat amusing to watch Little Naoki with her face buried in a book that\u2019s almost larger than she is. Idly, Naoki wonders if the girl, for all of her interest in the topic, has any amount of latent magical capability, or if the similarities between the pair of them continue as far as that. Pondering such idle thoughts, Naoki resolves to stand by silently until such a point that either Alden or Thaelyn has something to say to her, one of the children does something that would require action on her part, or it seems to be time to leave. Though, Little Naoki would probably stay in here forever, if she was allowed to. Heh. ", "1480058132000": "\u201cHmmmh.\u201d Naoki murmurs acknowledgment to Thaelyn, turning slightly to glance at her out of the corner of her eye. One of those who fates has treated favorably. One of those few lucky souls. The look Naoki slides sidelong is not quite one of contempt or envy, but one of mild curiosity, driven by musings about how Thaelyn might consider the world, and what further idealistic misconceptions she might have. But now is not the time, and this is not the company for a philosophical discussion, so Naoki leaves it there. Instead, she fixes her attention toward the remaining children who have not returned, Little Naoki with her book, and Juney evidently under someone\u2019s tutelage. Furrowing one brow, she spends a moment considering how to proceed but opts to defer the decision. They\u2019re not her children, after all, despite what appearances might suggestTurning to Alden, Naoki asks, \u201cHow would you like to handle this? I have no preference, but there\u2019s a bit more to the tour.\u201d", "1506891019000": "Lady Naoki storms through The Conjunction, having come from the Minister of Magic's Office. Or rather, the area outside the office, as @deadalus is apparently out. Consciously, she\u2019s aware that it\u2019s entirely plausible for him to be out, doing things. That\u2019s his job; to do things. He gets paid top coin to do things. However, it would be untrue to say Naoki is satisfied with that. She\u2019s doing things too, dammit, things of great import. She needs to speak with her top mages, and apparently, he\u2019s not around! What are we paying him for?!Someone else will have to do. With a certain sort of determination in her step, Naoki makes her way back to the \u2018lobby\u2019 of The Conjunction, as it were. Casting her eyes about, there certainly are a great many \u201csomeones\u201d to choose from. But apprentices and adepts won\u2019t do, and neither will the scholars or the scribes. She needs to speak to someone notable, someone capable of doing things.", "1506937150000": "\u201cPerhaps there is,\u201d she says, eyeing Vigil up. Though Lady Naoki hasn\u2019t had the pleasure of speaking to him to date, she\u2019s aware in a general sense of who he is. There\u2019s only one giant blue wisp archmage in The Enclave, as far as she\u2019s aware.Naoki spends a half moment to glance around. There are still many people about, and though only a few seem to be actively staring, she\u2019s aware that she\u2019s likely the center of the room's collective attention. Were this some other matter, she would insist upon privacy. Not today, though. \u201cWhat do you know about the construction of The Citadel?\u201d she asks, looking up toward Vigil\u2019s most head-like seeming bit.", "1506977175000": "\u201cMmhm.\u201d Naoki nods. This information matches up with her understanding of events. It's part of the history of the city; any self-respecting citizen ought to be aware. \u201cAnd,\u201d she continues immediately, \u201cright now, what\u2019s stopping us from doing it again?\u201d", "1508376782000": "Lady Naoki shakes her head. \u201cNot quite. Not another Citadel. A fortress. Soon, it will be my objective to control an area that will likely be far from The Empire\u2019s borders. To do that, I feel it would be wise to construct a fortified base. And rather than employing the standard methods of construction, with their menial labor and relatively slow progress, I would like a group of Enclave mages to assemble one using similar methods as those used to construct The Citadel. Primarily, quickly.\u201dShe pauses for a beat before continuing, \u201cI would like you to organize that group.\u201d", "1508539323000": "Lady Naoki nods, pleased that Vigil is willing and able.\u201cGood. I don\u2019t know the location yet which makes preparations difficult, but I\u2019ll be sure to let you know as soon as I do. I would suggest you take the relevant Magi off of critical assignments, as once the time comes, I will expect them to arrive as soon as they\u2019re able- ideally not at the expense of anything else.\u201dWith another small nod, it seems as if that's all she has to say.", "1508832428000": "Lady Naoki nods, as that is indeed all. A perfunctory, \u201cFarewell.\u201dHer business in The Conjunction concluded, Lady Naoki makes for the door, pausing only to deliver a flirtatious remark to an aspiring student along the way.", "1462832172000": "In the early afternoon, as the sun is approaching its highest point, Madame Naoki completes her accent, and steps out onto the upper walls of The Citadel. Artemis follows only a step behind, As they notice their unexpected visitor, the archers snap to attention, and attempt to pretend that they were paying attention before she arrived. Keeping watch, or whatever it is they\u2019re meant to be doing up on the walls. However, a dismissive hand gesture informs them- she\u2019s not here to inspect anything or receive salutes. That\u2019s what Ryden is for, she supposes. No, the purpose of her visit here is personal. Hands held behind her back, Naoki moves past the row of uneasy guards, and begins to meander along the fortifications. For as warm and high-ceilinged as her new office is, it\u2019s not quite the best environment for deep thinking. Or, at least, a change of scenery is sometimes beneficial, she supposes, internally justifying her escape.Having wandered a short way from the staircase, Naoki comes upon an open crenelle, and leans down into it, considering the city laid out before her. For a short while, she simply stands. Standing. Considering. Thinking. It isn\u2019t as if she didn\u2019t expect these sorts of thoughts. Related to responsibility and leadership and all that. Those are the sorts of things that are healthy to think about and consider rationally. It was the objective self-doubt that she wasn\u2019t expecting. Because, how is one supposed to justify Naoki as head of state? She has a bit more than ten years worth of life experience to draw on. That archer standing over near the stairs has double that, and then some! Wisdom comes with time. There is only so much one can absorb from books. Only raw knowledge, and that alone doesn\u2019t qualify an individual to make educated decisions. Well. Educated decisions, perhaps, but not necessarily wise decisions. All Naoki seems to be capable of is flying things by the seat of her metaphorical pants. Putting some marginal level of rational thought into how decisions will play out, and simply choosing the one that will most likely result in a state she is satisfied with. As of yet, there haven\u2019t been any additional, unforeseen circumstances that have thrown off this process. And as such, things have worked out so far. But as soon as something comes up. Some strange complication that throws one of these plans off kilter\u2026 Naoki shudders. A major misstep at this level would mean death. Perhaps not hers, but death all the same. Perhaps the portion that she finds most disturbing is that she would be prepared to accept responsibility for such a thing. Regardless, Naoki\u2019s introspection is interrupted; her earring glimmers in the sunlight as she receives a message. It seems as if someone calling themselves Emahra Untyrid  is at the gate, looking to meet with her. Assuming no trickery is afoot, that should be the strange elven woman from the previous night. Hm. Well. A bit of distraction never hurt anyone, Naoki supposes. That, and it should be interesting to obtain an understanding of the circumstances that apparently delivered the elf into Isra from some far off land. Perhaps she could be put to use, too. Naoki sends the order for Emahra to be sent up to the portion of the wall where she stands. It would probably be more proper to go down and meet with her in the office, or any of the many location around The Citadel that are actually intended for meeting in, but\u2026 whatever.", "1462874918000": "As Emahra approaches, Naoki rises from her leaning position in the crenelations, raising a hand in greeting, nodding for her to proceed with what she has to say, and giving Emahra the entirety of her attention as she speaks her bit. The news that Emahra hails from an entirely separate plane of existence is\u2026 quite an interesting tidbit of information indeed. Naoki has presumed that there was only long distance transportation involved, not inter-planar movement. To think that this elf, standing here speaking with her, was created and has spent the majority of her life in an entirely separate world\u2026 It\u2019s somewhat off putting. Somewhat scary, and humbling. Not only that, but she is living proof that other planes of existence exist, and travel is possible between them. The notion also spawns several sub-thoughts. For example, Naoki is able to understand Emahra with no difficulty. She has a touch of an accent, perhaps, but it would seem as if the spoken language is the same. As is etiquette. The concept of monarchy, being a heir, swords\u2026 The apparent similarities are present in each word. Are such concepts truly universal? Or are the circumstances that lead to their establishment in each respective plane simply that similar? The whole concept is worth deeper thought and further discussion at a later date, Naoki resolves. Regardless, here is yet another apparently incredibly talented individual come to offer their services. To be completely honest with herself, the frequency with which this happens to her is somewhat suspect to Naoki. There are presumably plenty of other individuals who would be able to make use of all of these people, and yet the seeming majority seek her out specifically. Perhaps there are greater forces at play, mandating this trend. Again regardless, here is yet another. After Emahra finishes speaking, Madame Naoki nods, and gives voice to her response. \u201cWell, Ms. Untyrid, know that you have my condolences, but I won\u2019t force you to dwell on the topic. Instead, allow me to say that I will continue to do what is reasonably within my power to help you adjust, and will gratefully accept your services. If you are even half as capable as you seem to me, you will doubtless be of immense assistance- far more than I can offer to you.\u201d \u201cI should mention at this point a tidbit I may not have stated plainly or you may have forgotten since our last meeting. I was elected to this position only last week. I am still in the process of becoming acclimated myself, and am currently instigating a number of reforms to Isra\u2019s government. There\u2019s no particular action required on your part with this information, but it was worth mentioning, I think, if only to explain why you\u2019ll probably end up in an unusually high station relative to how much time you\u2019ve spent in Isra.\u201d \u201cWith that said, however, I must inquire. What manner of skills do you possess that you would like to offer or obtain a job in practicing? You\u2019ve already proven yourself as something of a diplomat, and I would be inclined to believe that your weapon isn\u2019t merely for show. Beyond your silver tongue and swordsmanship, is there anything else I should be aware of, or do you have any preferences for the sort of work you\u2019d like to undertake?\u201d", "1463054652000": "As Emahra finishes with her second bit, Madame Naoki simply looks on and nods slowly. After a pause, she responds, \u201cYou really do have a way with words.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll send for someone\u2026 probably some minister with nothing better to do. They\u2019ll show you around and assist you in getting acclimated to Isra. I\u2018ll see to it that you\u2019re provided for, lodgings and such. And then, let\u2019s meet again in a week or so. By then I should have some idea about what sorts of specific tasks I\u2019d like you to tackle and we can get you assigned to some\u2026 position or something. I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll find there are a few, and one of them will suit you.\u201dWith that said, Madame Naoki nods once again, with an air of finality. Another task put off for another day. Eventually, she supposes, her ability to schedule things for later is going to outpace how many hours there are in the days ahead. Not today, though. Still plenty of time of time for unnecessary introspection. She stands from her leaning position on the wall, and approaches Emhara, extending a hand, presumably for shaking. \u201cIt was a pleasure to make your acquaintance more fully, Ms. Emahra. You seem to be handling things exceptionally well, considering your circumstances, and if you need something I can provide, don\u2019t hesitate to ask. I\u2019ll look forward to having your assistance in the days ahead, and suspect that this may be the beginning of a long-lasting and mutually prosperous relationship.\u201d", "1463093896000": "Now there\u2019s a woman who is qualified to be in my shoes, Naoki thinks to herself as Emahra departs. Those elves, what with their relatively lengthy lifespans, high society, and educations. Though Naoki is no expert judge of age, she figures Emahra must be at least fifty. Absolute minimum, judging by the cleavage. Fifty years that involved probably not only high education, not only education tailored to statecraft, but also probably strong parental figures and suitable idols to attempt to emulate. Dead now, perhaps, victim of whatever war deposed Emahra to this place, but all the same. Watching that mop of blue hair fade down the stairwell, Naoki can\u2019t help but consider it with a touch of the greenest envy. This is a new flavor of envy, she supposes, but not an entirely new sort. As opposed to envy for those who have it better as far as lifestyle goes, this is envy for those who know what they\u2019re doing. Who think they know what they\u2019re doing, at least. Emahra, judging their conversation, has a very neatly defined set of morals that make decisions quite easy. \u201cThat is my only true wish: To do good for the people.\u201dHow incredibly specious, Naoki muses. But how incredibly simple that thought must be to apply. \u2018Does this decision do good for the people? If yes, do. If no, do not do.\u2019 How linear. How easy. The only difficulties would come in where the situation becomes gray and muddled. But at that point, Naoki\u2019s decision making process is already on its sixth iteration and is referencing the most basic of philosophical ideals to justify itself. Emahra\u2019s way is very much worth her envy, Naoki thinks. It would probably serve her well as a head of state, too. None of this internal conflict nonsense.A deep, rolling sigh is lost to the wind as Naoki turns back to the crenelations and opts to spend a while longer in aimless thought before getting back to thoughts that will have lasting repercussions on thousands of her citizens. Strange to think of them as \u2018her citizens\u2019 she muses. Well. Perhaps not strange. It\u2019s not a very strange concept, to be fair. Just a new one. Part of the acclimation process, she supposes.", "1496198867000": "High atop one of The Citadel\u2019s tallest towers, Empress Naoki is seated upon a small stool. On one side of her, a table has been brought up and is piled with open books, loose sheets of parchment, and writing supplies. To Naoki\u2019s other side is a standing telescope, pointed skyward. For it rained today, making tonight a cloudless night- ideal for gazing at the stars. Peering through the telescope\u2019s eyepiece, Naoki looks to a distant star, admiring its beauty through the lens. Lifting her head and turning to the other side, Naoki places one finger in an open book, running it down a table in search of a particular entry. After a moment, she finds it, reads it, and turns back to check the alignment of her telescope. She nods once, apparently satisfied- the measurements match. Turning back to the table, she takes her quill and writes a line detailing her findings on one of the pieces of parchment. It is the sixtieth line of its kind on the third page; Naoki has been busy for the last few hours. Referring again to the book, Naoki takes note of the next entry and its matching star on the diagram on the opposite page.

After a moment spent looking, The Empress turns back to the table and plants her palm down on it, locking eyes with Rudiger. \u201cAlright. Sit.\u201d She gestures again for Rudiger to sit. \u201cBefore we get very far with this, let me ask this. This seems like an easy question, but I\u2019m going to ask anyway. Partially for me, so that I\u2019ll know that I asked, and partially to give you something to regret later in life.\u201d She flashes a smirk.\u201cDo you want to go any further with this? \u2026 You've been rushed into this. You\u2019re not prepared at all. You have no obligation to those two, no obligation to Votura, no obligation to me. If you accept this responsibility, it\u2019s going to be tough to put down. Ruling isn\u2019t all it\u2019s cracked up to be. It\u2019s stressful; it weighs on you \u2014 believe me when I say it.\u201d\u201cIf you aren\u2019t absolutely certain you want to, you don\u2019t need to become the Duke. It would be very easy for me to find you entirely unsuitable and send you on your way. To stage something and send them home as well. I can find someone else to run Vortua.\u201d", "1540858802000": "The Empress nods. She wasn\u2019t expecting any other answer. This is the sort of decision he\u2019s going to regret either way, but she wanted to offer him the option, and now it has been offered.\u201cVery well. Now, swear loyalty to me.\u201d", "1540922119000": "The Empress nods solemnly. She isn\u2019t sure if he expects her to give him her hand or something, but she doesn\u2019t.\u201cExcellent. From here forward, you are beholden to my will and mine alone. \u2014 Sit back down.\u201dAfter waiting for Rudiger to reseat himself, she continues, \u201cAs a new Duke, as a novice, as someone that they sought out, House Gediminas and House Vyatautas will expect to have some level of power over you \u2014 That\u2019s likely why they sought you out in the first place, to have power over you as opposed to the current situation with my governor. \u2014 They will attempt to push you around, to impose the old traditions on you. They will ask favors of you, and expect you to cater to their will, because in the past, Dukes have been reliant on the influential families for their power.\u201d\u201cThis is no longer so. You will be the first Duke of Vortua backed by Imperial Law. Your power will stem not from the implied consent and cooperation of Vortua\u2019s population, but from my word.\u201d The Empress begins speaking with her hands, punctuating the last sentence with two very deliberate taps on the table.\u201cIt will likely often be in your interest to cooperate with the big Houses, but remember that they have no power over you. To go against your will is to go against mine, and you may need to remind them of that. Remember that it\u2019s not very far from here to Vortua as the griffin flies, and Isra will intervene on your behalf to maintain order.\u201dShe pauses to assess how Rudiger is taking this.", "1540949786000": "\u201cI think you\u2019ll do well as The Duke,\u201d The Empress says. \u201cAnd I mean that.\u201d\u201cIf it\u2019s alright with you, let\u2019s skip the part where I threaten you. I\u2019m putting you on this throne; I can take you off, and so on and so forth.\u201d The Empress dismisses this line of thinking with a waving of her hands. She wouldn\u2019t be telling Rudiger anything he doesn\u2019t already suspect.\u201cWhy don\u2019t you ask me a question,\u201d she prompts. \u201cYou probably have a few.\u201d", "1541014855000": "\u201cWell.\u201d The Empress\u2019s mouth slides from side to side on her face. \u201cThe people need to be told.

It\u2019s a few moments before she continues, \u201cA regrettable occurrence, though it makes for a good story. Thank you.\u201dThough it didn\u2019t help the mood any, the story accomplished what Naoki had hoped, which was to give her insight into Rudiger\u2019s character. Living by the blade, he\u2019s made difficult decisions and come out the other side with all manner of life experiences and scars. That was more or less the impression she got, but it was a good story.\u201cWe\u2019ll need to make sure your horse is well cared for,\u201d she adds. \u201cThough I think that may be all for now. There are rooms here at The Citadel for you and your \u2018friends,\u2019 and tomorrow I\u2019ll begin showing you the things you\u2019ll need to know.

It is, simply put, a crystal ball, a device attuned to divination and scrying magics, which can display visions of the future or show distant lands. At present, it shows a pair of dragons, one orange, one blue, flying above what would seem to be a somewhat mountainous region, and is, in reality, a portion of Central Meridian. The scryer operating the orb, a diminutive hooded Encalve mage of perhaps ninety, sits opposite Naoki, humming slightly as he maintains the image. Ringed around the table, warriors and officers of varying ranks and disciplines stand in a loose circle, having been summoned, but not having received any further instructions. Naoki, for her part, seems less than pleased. Her free hand rests on the arm of her chair, and the sound of her two fingers tapping seems to be the loudest noise in the room. Though it is partially obscured by her other hand, her expression is a scowl, as she stares at the dragon in the ball, unblinking. Though generally a rather compassionate and understanding sort, Naoki has not a smithereen of forgiveness for those who she believes to have wronged her, but especially those close to her. And this orange dragon, Trogdor, has done exactly that. Years ago, before Naoki possessed the means to do much about it, this dragon entered the city of Isra and happened across Kate Green. In the course of an interaction Naoki did not witness or receive the details about, he came quite close to harming Kate, and likely would have done so, if not for the timely intervention of a particular clothier and the subsequent efforts of Grandma, who was Isra\u2019s Head of the Justice Department at the time.After Grandma\u2019s very clear instructions not to return to Isra, the dragon did not, and though Naoki was quite upset at the time, she was willing to leave it be and go on living her life and such. But now, the dragon dares to return. Now, of all times, that it is well within Naoki\u2019s power to have it destroyed. Yet, it is associating with the blue one, Jarkoopi. Once a dubiously useful component of The Free City\u2019s government. Then a member of the Goraian regime. Now, he is an enemy of the state. His lair remains in Meridian, and he has slumbered within. It hasn\u2019t been viable to attack the dragon in its lair, and seeing as how he has not been bothering anyone, Naoki was willing to watch him slumber, and perhaps deal with him later.Now, according to reports from earlier in the day, the two are working together, and this does not bode well. As two male dragons, Naoki thinks it unlikely that their association is anything as benign as mating. (Not that she would mind or hold it against them if it were.) No, there must be something at play. Some manner of dragon business, a reason for the two to be cooperating, instead of fighting for the other\u2019s hoard. They aren\u2019t flying in the direction of Isra, or anything else of particular importance; there isn\u2019t any reason to waste lives in unnecessary conflict if all they\u2019re looking to do is leave. But regardless, this is cause enough to take other actions, preparatory measures. Naoki\u2019s earring begins to simmer in the dimly lit room as she issues instructions. Those standing around her start to disperse as they receive their orders, and before long, Naoki sits alone with the old mage, still drumming her fingers, scowling at the crystal ball.", "1494127009000": "Apr 26, 2017 14:22:52 GMT -8 Knight-Captain Calgary said:Calgary's uniform clad body entered into the room, bearing a report that had just came in from some of his outriders in Medan.

I got the Riders in Medan on alert, give the word and the scaly pair are six feet deep.\"As Calgary enters the room, one ear atop Lady Naoki\u2019s head turns toward him and listens as he speaks, but otherwise, she remains as she is, focused on the image displayed before her. \u201cNo,\u201d she says.

They leave, to the east. \u2026 There is no need - not yet.\u201d Admittedly, the direction in which the dragons are flying isn\u2019t immediately obvious to the observer, given that no landmarks or points of reference are visible, but presumably the scryer is aware of such things.\u201cWe will stay our hand for now. The news that these two seem to be working together is significant, and a hasty action on our part now would do little good. For now, we will watch and wait; increase patrols and warn the people.

Ms. Freyja spoke of \u2018The Wyld,\u201d and claims it to be an imminent threat to The Empire.\u201dThe Empress doesn\u2019t elaborate beyond that, as she isn\u2019t the one with the information.\u201cAia. Some twenty days ago, you and your men were dispatched to the Southern Expanse to evaluate its defensibility and how we might best go about fortifying the area, as part of the larger project to secure The Empire\u2019s borders. Tell us what you saw and omit nothing.\u201d", "1523320990000": "While the others speak, The Empress listens quietly and stares at the map. The map, she thinks, is reasonably useful as a strategy tool, but it\u2019s even better as something to stare at while one is thinking. After Alden speaks, Naoki nods agreement. He\u2019s right, but they don\u2019t have the luxury of choosing their options, and they both know that. \u201cAlden, get the stone,\u201d The Empress says, and nothing further. She trusts that Alden will act with his usual efficacy to assemble a team, cooperate with Freyja, and achieve the objective in whatever manner he judges to be optimal, utilizing any and all resources he sees fit. No one is more capable, and by delegating the matter to him, she can focus on the immediate threat.\u201cWe must defend The Empire until we have the means to rid ourselves of The Wyld.\u201d\u201cDaedalus,\u201d she begins, \u201cAssemble your magi and go to The Tillers\u2019 aid. Your objectives are to mitigate casualties, stop The Wyld\u2019s advance, and study The Wyld, in that order.\u201dHe is a caster of incredible talent, and The Empress thinks the most effective use of his time would be in defending and developing countermagics to The Wyld. No matter what powers The Wyld may bring to bear, Daedalus will make an excellent addition to the defense.\u201cJun, you\u2019re the only one here with a choice, and I leave it to you.\u201dAs Naoki sees it, Jun is equally well-qualified to either join Alden in search of The Stone, or defend The Expanse, but she can\u2019t be in two places at once. Naoki isn\u2019t going to ask her to abandon her homeland to risk her life in some cave, but she also isn\u2019t going to send her to fight a losing battle when she could be helping Alden.", "1523491380000": "The Empress makes a shooing motion. \u201cGo,\u201d she says.\u201cStand by for further communication, and I hereby order each one of you not to die.\u201dShe says this entirely straight-faced, and crosses her arms afterward, for good measure.

Lady Naoki watches as the symbols representing The Legions begin to creep their way out of the city, oh-so-slowly. It will be a matter of days before they reach the battle. The cavalry will be faster, but even so.\"Yes,\" she says, hesitant. \u201cBut I\u2019d like you to be careful.\u201dTaking a marginally more relaxed tone of voice, she continues. \u201cThis is a new category of enemy, with unknown capabilities. Were it only an army I would not be concerned. \u2026 But I\u2019m worried about the crimson-robed figure. With legions, it\u2019s not exceedingly difficult to utilize countermagics. The Enclave has spent much time in training magi to do exactly that. With Jun and Daedalus there, I doubt the crimson-robed figure will be able to do a fraction of what they would otherwise.\u201d\u201cBut Dawn Riders cannot make use of countermagics so easily. Magic is faster and reaches farther than any arrow. You know better than I, Calgary, that Dawn Riders are difficult to train. Veterans are years in the making. I want to avoid unnecessary losses, and this\u2014an unknown caster of significant power, seems like an excellent way for many to die without just cause.\u201d\u201cSo go,\u201d she says, \u201c and support Aia\u2019s men and The Tillers until The Legions arrive. But make every effort to sustain no casualties. If you must fall back, then do so. If something unexpected happens, The Dawn Riders are the first response, and I need them to be at full strength.\u201d", "1524174151000": "\u201cMmmmh.\u201d The Empress murmurs begrudging acknowledgment.

It depicts the entire Empire, and on it, the entirety of Isra\u2019s military assets are represented in magical red ink.

Over here in the east, The Expanse is being encroached upon by a magical entity introduced to me as \u2018The Wyld,\u2019 and The Tillers are doing their best to repel it.\u201dGesturing, The Empress indicates the Land Tillers and their thin line of archers, as they are drawn on the map.\u201cWe have sent Enclave magi to assist, and the Legions are preparing to march. But you are not going with them.\u201d\u201cYou are going south,\u201d she continues, \u201cWith the Sixth and Seventh Legions.

So, under the pretense of reinforcing the southern border in anticipation of other attacks, you will march the Sixth and Seventh Legions south, to Waerham Keep.\u201dAs she\u2019s speaking, Naoki traces a route the keep and taps it a few times.\u201cThere, you will meet the garrison, deposit some supplies, and rest your men. That night, you will open this scroll, and continue based on the instructions therein\u2014with all appropriate discretion.\u201dOffering him a scroll sealed with wax, The Empress makes eye contact with General Dreadfort in an attempt to ensure he follows her meaning.", "1456441269000": "Standing from her seat, Madame Naoki takes the floor, nodding to Tyrus. \u201cThank you, Minister Sephiran. I am Madame Naoki, Treasurer. I have additional information to share, regarding the effect this has on our economy, the closure of their borders and some information I received from another source.\u201d\u201cThe Medanese borders were closed last week, and all approaching visitors and trade caravans have been denied entry. From what I've been able to gather, they're denying entry to every single individual who approaches, including our traders, merchants, travelers, and also that of other nations, and independent parties. This is going to have a fairly major impact on the Isranian economy in that we used to import and export a lot to Medan on a very regular basis, and now all of that has stopped. I'm not sure yet, of the full impact this will have, but let it suffice to say that this is definitely detrimental to us, and there may be some shortages of certain commodities in the next few weeks. I'm going to do everything I can to dampen the impact and maintain the stability of the economy, but we've just lost one of our major trade partners, and there's a limit as to what I'm going to be able to do. The most major countermeasure that I think is worth mentioning now is that I intend to open trade routes with The Kingdom of Gauldin, and I believe in doing so, we can compensate in some capacity for the loss of Medanese goods.\"\"Additionally, they\u2019re building walls. Large, stone walls around their borders, and are manning them with soldiers. This information was provided to be by a trustworthy source of mine who is currently loitering a short ways away from the border. This is a massive step up from the previous border security of Medan, and I believe it is safe to assume that they are also arming themselves. I have agents passively observing from afar, but none within the borders themselves.\u201d\u201cAdditionally, I was approached last night by one of my acquaintances. Though I cannot vouch directly for the accuracy of this information, he told me that, according to one of his companions who is gifted in an esoteric form of srying magic, that there is \u2018great suffering\u2019 currently occurring within the borders of what we once knew as Medan, implying mass torture. Greater investigation will obviously be required before we go accusing anyone of anything, but my contact was very distressed, and attempted to convince me to take independent action against Goraria- which I have not. I have, so far, only dispatched scouts to observe the border from afar, and relate back any information they can gather from a kilometer away- information I will be swift in sharing with you all, as soon as I receive it. I have brought my contact, he who knows firsthand of the scrying magic, here with me today. He is @hyydra , a shaman of the orc tribe of Falkreath. Though his methods aren\u2019t quite the same as the manner of magic we practice here, I believe them to be at least worth considering as plausibly effective. He\u2019s waiting outside, and we could call him in if The Assembly would like to hear what he has to say first-hand.\u201dNodding, Naoki signifies that she\u2019s finished with her bit, and sits back down, waiting to be addressed again, or asked a question. ", "1456717874000": "Raising her hand, Naoki chimes in again. \u201cI support all of those mentioned measures, and would like to suggest another.\u201dStanding, she delivers her proposal.\u201cI would like to motion that we open diplomatic relations with other nations as well, such as Gualdin and Atlanticus. I would like to establish trade agreements with them both, but as far as I\u2019m aware, we have not  engaged in any diplomatic talks with them. I think that, if my understanding is correct, they would be willing to receive ambassadors, and most likely amenable to the concept of trade agreements. I would be willing to be part of or lead a delegation sent to either nation, or personally facilitate this process in any way that I can- but it is my opinion we should waste no time in speaking with potential allies and trade partners.\u201d", "1456885392000": "Madame Naoki nods, and sits down. She had already volunteered to be part of a delegation, and knows that Ildesias is already aware of her abilities as they\u2019re applicable to matters such as these. Seeing as how there are three potential delegates in Ildesias, Tyrus, and herself, and three nations that need to have ambassadors sent, Naoki hopes, but does not voice her desire to be assigned to be part of the delegation sent to Gauldin. Of the three nations, Gauldin has the greatest potential for profitable trade, and she\u2019ll need to pay it a visit eventually for this reason. Being a member of the first group would allow her to start on this task earlier, and travel less. Not to mention how she had been planning a visit anyway. That, and she would hardly feel comfortable being part of a delegation sent to Goraia. Too many unknowns, not enough information, too much potential for violence. Her negotiation skills are strong, yes, but strong enough to negotiate peace in that scenario? It isn\u2019t often that Naoki doubts herself, but this is one of those few times. She may be willing to visit to re-establish trade after the initial meeting results in some manner of non-aggression pact, but being part of the first team is altogether too dangerous and too large a task for her. She doesn\u2019t fancy being 'the ambassador Goraia killed to start the war'. Ildesias would probably want to see to that himself anyway, and goodness knows he can fend for himself. She still has another matter to bring up at this meeting, and she knows that Grandma has another subject of her own to touch on, but for now, Naoki sits quietly and awaits a further development in the discussion. ", "1457746041000": "Over the course of the next few hours, The Assembly meeting concludes. A few conclusions are reached, and a number of operations are set into motion. First and foremost, the concept of utilizing magical defensive measures is greenlighted. The Justice Department, Conjunction, and military work cooperatively to set up and establish numerous systems of wards, defensive scrying and other magical defensive systems and gubbins around The Citadel, Isra in general, and also in the plains immediately surrounding Isra. Secondly, a defensive military buildup is ordered on the southern border, where the Isranian border is closest to the Goraian border. Soldiers are called into service, border defenses are repaired and prepared, and constant and complete observational vigilance on the southern border and the lands beyond is established and maintained. If Goraia were to make any offensive movements, Isra would not be caught with its metaphorical pants of defense down. Not a full mobilization, mind you, or in a way that seems as if Isra is preparing for an attack itself, simply heightened patrols  and an established state of readiness. Thirdly, teams of delegates are dispatched to other nations to open diplomatic relations. Minister Sephiran will be taking the heaviest assignment of opening diplomatic relations with the new state of Goraira, and Madame Naoki will tour around essentially the rest of the civilized word as it exists in the context of establishing viable trade routes with Isra. Their goals are similar, to open diplomatic relations, forge alliances where applicable, (re)establish trade, and leave liaisons and ambassadors to facilitate continued positive relations between nations.", "1461745774000": "Like any responsible minister, Madame Naoki attends the meeting. The announcement of Ildesias\u2019 resignation comes as equal parts surprising and not, to her. Yes, she was aware that he was being overworked, and that he has been serving for several years now, but this is somewhat sooner than she anticipated. She had planned to prepare more thoroughly for this eventuality, and have a competent puppet prepared and established by this point, but\u2026 so soon. She thought that she had another few months, at the very least. Goodness. She glances around the table, assessing each of the faces. She knows the grand majority of them to be incompetent, incapable, or otherwise unsuited for the role. Most won\u2019t even make an attempt. The most likely candidate to be chosen, if she were to not make an effort, would likely be Minister Sephiran. Hm. She could attempt to buy him out after the fact, or otherwise gain some influence with him\u2026 but the ways that she would be forced to do that would be quite untoward, and even if she managed to successfully obtain that sort of leverage, he would not have a positive opinion of her, and may attempt to have her removed. Puppets are only puppets as so far as they\u2019re willing to be puppets, she muses. Tyrus would not be suitable for her purposes immediately, and the vote is happening now.As the call for any who would like to be considered in the voting process is called, Naoki\u2019s thoughts go out to Kate, and the discussion they had on this very topic, a few months ago. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019d like to, though. Run the whole city, that is. ... That\u2019s too much.\u201d Madame Naoki is aware, if she were to successfully be elected as Lady of The Free City, she would have even less time to spend with Kate, and even more responsibilities. Which is exactly what she had promised Kate that she would avoid. But\u2026 another opportunity like this isn\u2019t going to arise again. If she is to do everything within her power to create the best set of circumstances for living possible, this is an opportunity that cannot be passed up.  It almost becomes a question of values, of which obligation to choose. All of her lofty and possibly specious ambitions about changing the world, the city of Isra, and all of the people in it, or the one individual who matters more than anything else.With only seconds left and a horrible lump in her throat, Naoki stands. She will run for Ladyship of Isra.", "1461843577000": "Standing from her seat, Madane Naoki turns to face Tyrus as he approaches. \u201cAh, Tyrus, I\u2019m forced to agree with you on that point. Altogether too hot. I motion that among our first acts in office, we install some manner of ventilation in this room.\u201dAs Tyrus continues speaking, Naoki takes the opportunity to readjust her hair, bringing it all back to form an impromptu and somewhat untidy bun. As he frames his invitation, one eyebrow and one side of her mouth curve upward. She had planned to invite him to dinner shortly after the meeting- but he had beaten her to the punch! Fair enough, she supposes. \u201cIt would be my pleasure to accept. We have a great many things to discuss, and I haven\u2019t quite had the pleasure of meeting you properly before today. If you would allow me\u2026\u201d she glances to one of the windows, gauging the time of day \u201c...an hour or two to prepare and square a few matters away, I\u2019ll happily join you at your estate for dinner.\u201dWith that said, she returns her attention to her small pile of belongings and documents, gathering them up in preparation to depart. ", "1461912582000": "\u201cVery well, I\u2019ll see you then.\u201dMadame Naoki spends a short while longer in The Assembly, taking the time after the meeting has officially dispersed to speak with a few Ministers. Some offer congratulations or advice. Others receive preliminary instructions, telling them how to prepare for the official orders she will be issuing once properly appointed. As the last stop on her metaphorical victory lap, she seeks out Robert K. Wallace  , approaching him where he loiters near the door, attempting to strike up a conversation with one of the more attractive female ministers, who is rather pointedly ignoring him. Naoki inserts herself into the conversation by approaching the female minister from behind, and sliding her to one side with a hand placed on her hip and sliding into the space she was occupying directly before Wallace. \u201cYou!\u201dShe levies a pointed finger at Wallace, pausing for just a moment to savor it, smirk growing steadily.\u201cYou\u2019re fired.\u201dWithout waiting to see his expression, Madame Naoki abruptly turns about and exits through the door, tail swaying with her steps. Satisfied. ", "1462956297000": "At the request of the minister who met with the\u00a0@redsteel rider in the Keep Hall, Madame Naoki calls an Assembly Meeting. The first since she's been elected. Not even a scheduled one, either- an emergency meeting to discuss the unsettling news that Aaedan's White City has been lost to undead.\u00a0For the first time, she seats herself in the tall-backed chair at the far end of the room. As she watches ministers file in, she realizes why, exactly, she is granted emergency powers in times of crisis. There are no more than twenty filled seats, around the massive circular table. It seems as if it's rather difficult for everyone to attend unscheduled meetings.\u00a0They're probably busy, she muses. Probably out on hunting trips. Perhaps taking a nice mid-day nap. Farrrrr too busy to discuss an undead rising apparently large enough to threaten the entirety of the known world. With a great huff, she rests her chin in her palm, and resolves to wait another ten minutes for any Ministers to make their way in.\u00a0", "1463148001000": "After waiting the aforementioned ten minutes, Madame Naoki stands, and motions to the guards near the door. They nod in response, and shut the great double doors, signaling the start of the meeting. Though The Assembly isn't quite fully assembled, as it were, this would have to do. Matter such as these cannot afford to wait. After waiting a moment for what few murmurs of private conversation exist to fade away, she addresses the room, \u201cWelcome, one and all, to this emergency gathering of the assembly. Since this is an emergency meeting, let\u2019s go ahead and bypass the formalities, and get directly to the cause of this meeting.\u201dWith one arm, she gestures to an armored man standing near the great double doors.\u00a0\u201cEarlier today, around noon, we were joined by this man. He claims to be a member of Aaedan\u2019s @redsteel, which is apparently a legion of cavalry. He rode into Isra with the news that a massive number of undead have risen in Aaedan, and have taken The White City, and are a significant enough force to potentially threaten the rest of the world. I\u2019ve gone ahead and dispatched The Dawn Riders to verify his claims, but before proceeding with their report or considering action, let\u2019s see what all he has to say.\u201dReseating herself, Naoki gestures to the Redsteel Legion soldier, prompting them to take the floor and say all that he has to say.", "1463230318000": "Madame Naoki listens as the rider provides his report. Well, there are an awful lot of things that can kill entire cities if you try hard enough, she muses. Regardless, she stands again, retaking the floor once he is finished. \u201cThat is grave news indeed. As I mentioned, a few hours ago, with emergency powers, I dispatched Elizabeth Finch   to fly over and assess the situation firsthand. She has just delivered her report telepathically, and I will now repeat it to you all.\u201dWith that said, Naoki proceeds to repeat, word for word, Elizabeth\u2019s message, even doing a slight impersonation of the general\u2019s tone of voice. May 13, 2016 6:12:41 GMT -8 Elizabeth Finch said:\"Madame Naoki, it's General Finch. I have not yet been able to locate Aaedan's Queen, she appears to be leading her knights in the main charge on the Palace, but the situation is more than apparent. Forces from the Land-Tillers and Belrow have joined what remains of Aaedan's military, and up until a half hour ago the threat was contained in the city. Half an hour ago, a magical rain began to fall. This rain, besides making it difficult to fly, has also begun to reanimate the dead beyond the walls. I have already lost half a dozen Riders-in-Training before we figured out what was going on. The undead are incredibly resilient requiring a complete destruction of the head or immolation.\"After relaying the message, Naoki pauses for a moment to allow everyone to digest the message, and does some thinking herself. Not only does whatever power is at play over there have the ability to kill an entire city and reanimate the corpses as undead in the space of a mere twenty four hours, they also have the ability to raise other undead from above, through some magical mechanism that appears as rain. Impressive. Terrifying, but impressive. Seems like someone pissed off the wrong necromancer. After allowing all assembled to assess the reports in combination and form their own conclusions, Madame Naoki speaks again, addressing the room at large. \u201cThe situation in Aaedan is, I don\u2019t think anyone will challenge me when I say this, definitely a potential threat, and we should consider it as such. With that in mind, all that remains is deciding how to best address it, if at all. I would first motion that The Enclave of Isranian Magi   begin taking city-wide defensive measures to ensure that a similar magic cannot sweep through Isra in a similar manner. And that patrols and gate guardsmen take extra caution and keep their eyes open for undead, and those who show evidence or proficiency in necromancy. With a potential enemy as powerful as all this, we should not underestimate their ability, and should be cautious not to allow their agents to enter our city.\u201d\u201cHowever, the matter that is not quite so easy to agree upon may be who to send. \u2026 This man,\u201d she gestures to the rider, \u201cwould like to see us mobilize the army to quench the undead currently terrorizing their lands. Doing that would obviously mean sending our soldiers all the way across The Expanse into the core of this necromatic tragedy. Many of them might not return. But they would be the lucky ones.\u201dShe pauses for a morbid moment, casting her singular uncovered eye around the table, allowing her implication of fallen soldiers returning to Isra as a component of an undead army sink in. \u201cSo. With all of that in mind, our first real decision is whether or not to send the army to join Land Tillers' State   and The Kingdom of Belrow  in combating the undead that currently plague the lands of Aaedan. It is also worth considering, if we mobilize and deploy a considerable portion of the army, we would be that much more vulnerable to an attack. The possibility that this is all a clever plot- a distraction, does exist. Discuss.\u201d With that said, Madame Naoki reseats herself, allowing any who might choose to speak next to take the floor and say their bit.", "1463279266000": "Madame Naoki doesn't wait for anyone else to take the floor, but does so herself shortly after Ryden reseats himself.\u00a0\u201cYou raise a good point, Ryden, but one has to keep in mind. To reach Isra from The White City, the undead will have to traverse the entirety of The Expanse. Which is a considerable distance, a considerable buffer, to be sure, but by the point they come knocking at our doors, it will be a multi-national crisis, and the undead will number many more thousands than they do now, having likely consumed the Land Tiller people.\"\u00a0\u201cBased on what General Finch has said, it seems as if the situation will escalate to that stage if we don\u2019t intervene. And while it would not be preferable to send our soldiers to a battlefield where they might die, it also wouldn\u2019t be preferable to allow this situation to escalate to the point where the undead have risen in number enough to assault Isra itself. Right now, we would seem to have the ability to contain the threat. And one could argue that it would be more foolish to stand idly by and watch the threat grow to a size where we cannot approach it, than to attempt to address it now. To stamp the blaze out before it grows bigger than our boot, as it were.\"\"Ryden, if you don\u2019t advocate sending the armies to address the threat and attempt to quash it directly, how do you propose we deal with it? Because it would seem to me that if we don\u2019t take decisive action of some sort, our neighboring nations, notably the\u00a0Land Tillers' State , will be overcome and destroyed along with Aaedan. At the very least, we should consider offering military assistance to defend them.\"Finished with her statement, Naoki sits, and nods in Ryden's direction, indicating he should respond.\u00a0", "1463292493000": "Madame Naoki stands and accepts the metaphorical baton. \u201cIt\u2019s not quite that I\u2019m more concerned about the citizens of other nations over our own- it\u2019s that I\u2019m concerned about the strategic value of The Land Tiller\u2019s state being lost to the tide of undead. I worked in the Treasury Department previously, yes? The way I finagled things following the coup that resulted in Goraia and lost us Medan as a trading partner, some eighty percent of foodstuffs imported into Isra on a monthly basis comes directly from The Expanse. That number may have fluctuated some in the last few months, but I\u2019m willing to bet- quite confidently, that it\u2019s a significant portion. More than two thirds of imported foods.\u201d \u201cWhich is, of course, to speak nothing of The Land Tiller\u2019s states other contributions, which are many and varied. I don\u2019t think we can justify to anyone simply standing by and watching the lot of them be consumed by undead. Between our relative strategic and economic reliance, and the long lasting semi-formal alliance between our peoples, I don\u2019t believe we can sit idly by and watch them be run down, if it comes down to that. I am no more willing to send our men to their deaths than you are, but defending The Expanse is akin to defending our eastern border. We cannot afford to let it fall completely.\u201d\u201cIt is worth considering that the forces of The Land Tiller\u2019s state are quite capable. Though the numerical value of their armed forces are quite small, they have all sorts of wyverns and powerful mages at the ready. It may be perfectly acceptable to sit back and allow them to handle their own defense. They maaay be capable of it. However, if they\u2019re not, not only will our eastern border be compromised, and not only will Isra struggle to feed itself, but those same very powerful mages will be blasting holes in our walls. I am of the opinion that if nothing else, we ought to ensure that The Land Tillers' State does not sustain casualties so great as to incapacitate them as a nation. It is of the utmost importance that they continue to stand, as they are one of the pillars that supports Isra in its current state.\u201d\u201cHowever, I agree. We do need more information, regardless of what we decide to do. If you\u2019ll allow me a moment, I will attempt to utilize the scrying foci on General Finch\u2019s person, and find some of these answers myself.\u201dReseating herself, Madame Naoki rests her chin in one palm, and shuts her visible eye. Her earring begins to glow with a hitherto unforeseen intensity as she makes telepathic contact with a handful of individuals, and begins to forcefully gather information from Finch\u2019s division. With her unoccupied hand, she waves lazily in Ryden\u2019s general direction, but keeps her eyes shut.  \u201cYou may keep talking, my apologies.\u201d", "1463326542000": "As the rider and Ryden exchange words, Madame Naoki remains as she is, hand in chin, earring glowing, eyes shut in apparent concentration. Though it isn\u2019t audible over the impassioned words of her ministers, a soft chuckle passes her lips. How amusing it is to watch emotions run rampant. Though she recognizes the emotions are well-placed, and would definitely prefer impassioned ministers over dispassionate ones, it\u2019s still amusing to watch them assume full control. Silently, she muses what an Assembly made of dispassionate, but fiercely calculative and well intentioned ministers would look like. Probably quite efficient, she muses. After the two have completed their exchange and Tyrus has said his bit, Naoki opens her eyes and stands, addressing the table at large. \u201cRight, well, in regards to that information, I can\u2019t say that I can definitively answer any of those questions that were asked in regards to the combat capabilities of the undead. None of the soldiers I was able to speak with directly know for sure, and I can\u2019t quite tell, looking over their metaphorical shoulders with scrying. I mean- they\u2019re doing quite well- to be fair, and by the time they can successfully make good on my order to pull back from the front lines to the base camp they\u2019ve established, General Finch will be able to collect information herself, and get back to us with the results before any more fighting ensues.\u201d \u201cFair enough, though, Ryden. However, for as much as you accuse me of manipulating the numbers, we are dependent on the Land Tillers for a great number of commodities. Isra is self-sufficient enough not to starve should all trade from The Expanse halt, yes, but what I said, that we would struggle, is true. The Free Plains are only capable of growing so many things, and there\u2019s a difference between living and living well. It would take another economic management miracle to re-establish the wealth of foodstuffs our citizens currently have easy access to. If you\u2019d like to visit the treasury department and go find out that it\u2019s seventy six percent of imports, or whatever the number is, go ahead, but Isra is mildly dependent on The Land Tillers' State, both strategically and economically and that much is not up for debate.\u201d\u201cStill, it seems as if we\u2019ve come to a conclusion. Send a force to The Expanse, have them establish fortifications outside the observed range of the magics. Provide to those who are in the process of fighting on the front lines a position to fall back to safely, and maybe send some supplies over as a show of good faith. We could even take this opportunity to establish a more formal alliance with the Land Tiller people. Nothing quite brings people together like standing shoulder to shoulder, fighting off what could become the next cataclysm\u2026\u201d Naoki trails off, the intonation of her words unreadable. \u201cWell. Regardless. Does anyone have a problem with that proposed course of action?\u201dStill standing, her eyes sweep around the circumference of the table, eyeing each minister for an objection.", "1463386363000": "Naoki waits a short while for any to rise in opposition, before nodding firmly. \u201cVery well; so it shall be.\u201dFirst, Madame Naoki turns to her right to address the High General, \u201cCyronin, your legions march tomorrow. Assemble and lead a force to the east, and reinforce the border defenses of the Land Tiller people, with the intent of preventing the undead threat from spreading into their lands. It isn\u2019t The Assembly's place to decide which legions you choose or enforce battle plans, so we\u2019ll conduct a meeting in the tower later today to discuss such specifics.\u201dNext, Naoki turns to her left to face Ryden, and addresses him, \u201cJudiciary Governor Greyrion, you will see to it that our borders increase security and patrols are kept vigilant. Once Cyronin\u2019s legions are in position and entrenched, General Finch and her Dawn Riders will most likely return, depending on the conditions and if they are required on the defense, and assist you with patrols. See to it that the undead cannot make their way into our lands, and make doubly sure they cannot sneak their way into our city.\u201dAddressing the The Enclave of Isranian Magi \u2019s representative, she issues another set of instructions, \u201cThe Enclave should see to it, as is their task, that all powerful magic within Isra is known and authorized. No large scale necromancy. No death-haze nonsense, and nothing that even so much as resembles what happened in Aaedan. If that means you need to crack down on and restrict otherwise lawful activities for a short time, so be it. Additionally, large scale safeguards and defensive measures should be put in place to prevent such magics if they are casted from afar. The White City was caught unaware and unprepared. We will not be.\u201dWith that final statement, Naoki plants one palm firmly on the surface of the table and speaks with an as of yet unforeseen conviction, casting her singular visible eye around the table, fixing each present minister with it and making intense eye contact for the space of a moment. There is a time and place to display emotion, she knows. She will not be known as the final Lady of Isra, nor as anyone\u2019s stooge. In those final few words, she instills the gravity of the matter at hand and a healthy dose of confidence in those who would choose to be inspired. Now, if she has chosen her hands well, as she knows she has, they will comply with each and every ounce of their being to fulfill their respective duties to the best of their abilities and ensure their collective plans come to full fruition.After letting her words hang in the air for a moment longer, she releases the pressure on the poor table, straightens, and casts her eyes about the room once more, speaking again with only an appropriate amount of intensity.\u00a0\u201cDoes anyone have any questions about their instructions, any issues to raise with that which I have just decided, or any related inquiries or matters to bring to the table? We may have forgotten something important.\u201dShe will wait an appropriate amount of time for any ministers who would choose to speak up to do so, and move forward shortly if none do.", "1463592721000": "After waiting an appropriate amount of time, Madame Naoki speaks again, \u201cAlright, great. You all have your instructions, I\u2019m glad we could come to a swift conclusion on this matter. Meeting adjourned. Make sure to be here for the regularly scheduled meeting next week, and be prepared for more emergency meetings if the situation develops unexpectedly. Have a good day, you lot.\u201dWith a firm nod of finality, Madame Naoki dismisses The Assembly. Remaining standing, she begins to gather her belongings, presumably in preparation to depart. Any who might choose to would have the opportunity to approach her during this period, but if none do, she will eventually make her exit. ", "1464054761000": "On a fine Wednesday afternoon, just as the sun is beginning its descent from the apex of its journey across the sky, Madame Naoki makes her way into the Assembly Chamber. Winding her way around the table that dominates the room, she glances up to see that the materials she had requested be delivered have been; a crate of maps and documents sit before her high-backed seat, and a display board rests against the wall. Though the regularly scheduled Assembly meeting isn\u2019t slated to start for about a half hour yet, Naoki\u2019s work begins now. Taking her seat, she begins to unload the crate\u2019s contents onto the table, and sort through the documents. Today she would be presenting her grand plan for Isra\u2019s economic growth and industry creation, and as ambitious as her strategy is, a number of visual aides would be necessary to properly explain it, to say nothing of her stacks of notes and drafts of legislation to put her plan into place. After sorting her documents out and arranging them in a rough order of presentation, Madame Naoki turns her attention next to her collection of maps. The geography around Isra will be of the utmost importance to her strategy, and demonstrating which areas she is referring to at the appropriate points in the discussion will be paramount. Unrolling first her final map- with all of her proposed constructions and alterations marked across a nation-wide map, she approaches the display board, stretches the map across it, and pins it in place.\u00a0Stepping back, she folds her arms across her chest, and takes a moment simply to consider the map, and the grand strategy it represents. Her brainchild of almost six months now, if this goes as it ought to, Isra's GDP- among other things, will absolutely\u00a0soar. With all grand plans, the only issues will rise in executing it, and she knows more fully than any other- fitting individuals to do so haven't made themselves known yet. Hence, this meeting. With official Assembly approval, her machinations will be able to enter government sanctioned high gear.\u00a0Nodding firmly to herself, Naoki continues about setting up her presentation. Presently, Ministers should begin to arrive in preparation for the meeting.\u00a0", "1464356293000": "As the grand doors open, one pointed ear turns to follow his approach, though Madame Naoki\u2019s gaze remains fixed on whatever document she is currently reviewing. After he approaches and makes his greeting, she responds in kind, \u201cHello, Tyrus. Things go well. I\u2019m preparing my series of industrial development proposals for today\u2019s meeting.\u201dHowever, the great doors do not close after allowing Tyrus entry. Instead, another set of feet- a light pattering in stark contrast to the heavy steps of Tyrus\u2019 boots make their way around the other side of the table. A page approaches, and after nodding his head in greeting, places his cargo on the table. A pair of tall glasses, filled very nearly to the rim with water. But still, Naoki does not look up, so consumed in her work. As it turns out, some of her figures are inconsistent from one page to the next. She supposes that isn\u2019t much of a big deal, the likelihood of anyone noticing the error is slim to none, but at the very least, it would probably be good to figure out which figure is correct. However, she does grace the page with a soft (and perhaps overly breathy), \u201cThank you,\u201d and gives him a tap with her tail to send him on his way. Blushing furiously, the page attempts to stammer out some response, before turning abruptly about and making for the door with all due haste, wishing all the while that his pants were not quite so loose. ", "1464744924000": "\u201cMmmmhm. I hope you\u2019re not too attached to the current disorganized  and inefficient state of Isra\u2019s industry...\u201dStill focused on the documents before her, Naoki extends one hand out to grasp her cup of water. However, apparently her depth perception isn\u2019t quite all that, when it comes to grabbing things without looking at them. At least, when it comes to not having the things in question spill everywhere.Naoki herself is quick enough to stand and not allow any of the liquid to soil her garments, but not quite quick enough to save her precious documents. All she can do is watch, aghast as her painstakingly ordered sheets of parchment darken and meticulously written letters smear and run together. In a matter of moments, the entire stack is ruined beyond any reasonable hope of recovery. For a moment, she simply stands there, looking. As if staring at them hard enough would undo what has been done. However, an adept observer may notice the slight trickle of blood dripping from her upper lip as she struggles not to cry out in frustration. But there\u2019s nothing to be done. The presentation is ruined, and there isn\u2019t anyone to blame but herself. Leaving the drenched documents there on the table, Naoki moves off to go find something to dry the table with. After a short while, the Assembly meeting begins on time. Naoki\u2019s documents are nowhere in sight, having been discarded earlier as part of cleaning the table. However, her map display still stands in its place behind her seat, unharmed. After the standard pleasantries of beginning the meeting and checking to ensure that there are no urgently pressing matters to address first, Madame Naoki stands, taking the floor herself to begin the first matter of business.\u201cAs some of you who read today\u2019s meeting plan may or may not be aware, I am to give a presentation on my plan I had an  hour long presentation prepared for you all today, but in an uncharacteristic display of  clumsiness, I seem to have spilled my drink all over my notes, rendering them unfit for anything more than disposal.\u201d\u201cSo you\u2019ll be getting the quick, purely oral version.\u201d\u00a0She punctuates this statement with a totally unrelated sensual licking of her lips, pausing for a moment before continuing,\u00a0\u201cTo get directly to the point, the purpose of my talk today is about making proper use of Isra\u2019s natural resources for the betterment of the city. This\u2026\u201dWith a gesture of her other hand, she indicates the display board, which is currently displaying a map. \u00a0\u201c...is, I hope at least a few of you are competent enough to realize, is a map of The Free Plains, and the areas surrounding it. We\u2019ve got the Norkari mountains up here toward the top, the forested border of The Expanse over there to the right, and so on. I should mention at this point- I\u2019m omitting the Norkari and the small villages and such. Their finances are not my concern. This area here, highlighted in blue\u2026 This is a rough approximation of where we farm things. Mostly in the large open fields to the south and west of the city, near to the river. We\u2019ve got a few artificial canals down here, that\u2019s all fine enough. We\u2019re using a few techniques taught to us by the Land Tillers a while back to farm more efficiently, but not very well, and not consistently. Some farmers are unaware, or are not applying the techniques properly.\u201d\u201cI have two plans in relation to farming that should be fairly non-conscientious. First and foremost, in an upcoming summit between Isra, The Kingdom of Gauldin  and The Land Tillers' State , I plan to suggest that The Land Tillers provide us again with their unmatched knowledge of coaxing the land into supporting life. Updated techniques, a reminder of how to practice the old ones, perhaps even some of their people to assist ours in setting up the requisite infrastructure. I\u2019m going to bargain for whatever I can get, and then attempt to distribute and encourage these advanced techniques as widely as possible across Isra\u2019s farmers. I figure it should go over reasonably well, because increasing their efficiency is congruent with increasing their gross profits.\u201d\u201cBefore I get into the second bit, let me first touch for a moment on the lumber industry. The areas in which Isran loggers primarily do their logging are displayed here in green. As you can see, the majority of lumber comes from up north, logging the forest that sits at the foot of the Norkari Mountains. The lumber is hauled south down this road, and into Isra.\u201d\u201cNow, there\u2019s nothing wrong with that, per say. However, it is grossly inefficient. Look right here, look to the west. Look at the enormous forest that sits right across the river, that we aren\u2019t making use of. The primary reason this is the case is a mostly practical one. Consider, for a moment, your average lumberjack. What equipment does he have? An axe. Sure, that\u2019s implied. Probably has a few axes, speaking realistically. And then, presumably, a cart, on which to load the logs and haul them back to Isra. And then, perhaps some patterned shirts, or whatever else lumberjacks have. I haven\u2019t looked too far into the matter, to be honest.\u201d\u201cBut notably, not a boat. That\u2019s what I was getting at. The majority of lumberjacks do not own ferries. And as such, all of these trees over here\u2026\u201d she gestures to the woods to the east, on the opposite side of the Silverion River, \u201c...are inaccessible to them. They could charter some independent ferry to take them across and haul their logs back, or invest in their own ferry to do it themselves, sure, and a few do, but that\u2019s not the path of least resistance. The path of least resistance is to spend three hours each morning trudging all the way up to the mountains, logging there, and then another three hours trudging back. The same is true, to a more limited extent, of the farming. There are many more farms established on this side of the river than the other, because it\u2019s much easier.\u201d\u201cAs it stands, there are only a paltry handful of private bridges. None of them in particularly excellent locations, or both wide and strong enough to support the transport of substantial throughputs of goods. Most of them are tolled by their owners, as well. As such, I propose the following. The construction of a grand bridge, large enough to alleviate these issues of efficiency we face. Large enough to be incorporated into the eastern roads, large enough to allow the transport of lumber across it without issue, large enough to open up the entire eastern/southern side of the Silverion River for development and use. Objections?\u201d", "1465097258000": "\u201cExcellent. Next thing are the mines\u2026\u201dOver the course of the next hour, Madame Naoki continues to go on about her plans for renovating Isra\u2019s industrial sector, and proposes a new plan to create a navy, complete with proposed port locations. No complaints are raised, and Naoki promises that all of the plans will be implemented just as soon as she can. Considering how long that all took, one would shudder to think of the meeting duration of her notes had been intact. \u201cOh. And earlier today, I was approached by Lord Crovan of House Winter. We came to something of an agreement about his Winterlands to the northeast becoming a part of Isra. I\u2019ll pass the details about that around now. So we\u2019ll be joined by him or his representative at the next meeting. That concludes the items I had to bring to the table for now.\u201dWith that said, Naoki passes around an official-looking document that details the arrangement reached between the pair in regards to Lord Crovan and his lands joining Isra. If any objections are raised with that, Naoki will stand to address them, but if not, another minister may take the floor. ", "1465587579000": "From her high seat at the rear of the room, Madame Naoki follows the proceedings closely, ears swiveling to follow the conversation. This wasn\u2019t quite what she was expecting out of the day\u2019s meeting, but Ryden raises a number of good points. So does Tyrus, of course, but the motion has already been set forth, so there\u2019s not too much that can be done at this point besides finish the conversation and hold the vote. She decides, once the pair of them are finished with accusations and defense, she\u2019ll stand and organize the vote. Until then, she looks toward Tyrus. He presumably has something more to argue. ", "1465673684000": "Rising from her seat, Madame Naoki preempts any response from Ryden or Deathforge. Speaking clearly, her gaze flickers from Ryden sitting off to her left, and Tyrus in his seat across the great circular table. \u201cI hate to interrupt, but you two are just going in circles. We\u2019ve all got things to do today, so unless there are any objections, let\u2019s just go ahead and bring this to a vote. Ryden Greyiron\u00a0has called a vote of no confidence in Prime Minister Tyrus Sephiran. We\u2019ll start with that.\u201dWithout any further ado or waiting to see if any objections are raised, Madame Naoki cuts the argument short to begin the process of the vote. Any citizen of Isra who would choose to vote should send their vote in a direct message to The Isran Empire . ", "1465725990000": " Naoki herself abstains from voting, seeing as how if she did, it would be an even number of votes with the not-quite-full Assembly that is assembled.\u00a0The ensuing vote proceeds.Standing from her chair, Madame Naoki addresses the Assembly with the results of the vote.\u00a0\"As it seems, the vote of no confidence in Prime Minster\u00a0Tyrus Sephiran  has succeeded. Succeeded, by a margin of nine votes.\"Taking a moment to compose herself, she places the document down on the table before her, and casts her gaze across the table, attempting to make eye contact with the former Prime Minister.\u00a0\"Tyrus. I must regretfully inform you, that by the power of Isra's Assembly, you have been stripped of your title, position, and responsibilities. No further reprimand will be administered, but you have just become a private citizen. For what it's worth, I have personally appreciated your involvement. You helped shape Isra into what it is today, regardless of any allegations.\"\"I think it may be best to conclude this meeting for today and hold an emergency meeting tomorrow to work through the implications of that vote and how we will proceed.\"What went unsaid was \"...and choose his successor.\" But a part of Naoki is genuinely unhappy to see Tyrus go, and\u00a0there's no need to be rude. Assuming that none challenge her suggestion of concluding the meeting, Naoki proceeds to do exactly that.", "1468815746000": "At Ryden\u2019s prompting, Naoki rose from her seat. A few papers were stacked neatly at her place at the head of the table, but there they sat, untouched and not even so much as glanced at. Planing one hand on the table and beginning to gesticulate with the other, she began, \u201cIt should be noted before I begin, there are ten positions on The Conclave that could potentially be filled. I\u2019ve not found suitable candidates for each one, so some of them are filled provisionally, and some of them simply lack an official. To start with, we\u2019ve got the Ministry of the Arts and the Ministry of Education, both of which lack a leader or any real substance. I\u2019d like to get them established sometime soon, and might end up doing so myself, but lack the time to do so now.\u201d\u201cBeyond that, we also have Judiciary Minister, which has been taken over by Minister Deathforge, following Ryden\u2019s election. For those of you unacquainted, his last title was Inspector Deathforge, and he has been serving as a member of the Judiciary Department for a few years, now. Ryden recommended Deathforge, and he seemed a logical enough choice to me, so here he is.\u201dAt this point, Naoki offered perfunctory nod in Deathforge\u2019s direction. Not too much more to be said about that. Next, she turned her attention to Ryden, sitting directly opposite her, and continued, \u201cThere\u2019s also the ministries of Foreign Affairs and Immigration, which Ryden has graciously offered to accept responsibility for. So, in the interest of having the job done right and keeping him busy, he\u2019ll be handling those things.\u201d \u201cFor the Environmental Minister, it is my pleasure to appoint Miss Minister Akai'a. Her druidic abilities, in combination with years worth of experience in diplomacy and knowledge of The Norkari Mountains and Isra\u2019s other associated territories make her an ideal choice to fulfill the responsibilities, and make sure Isra doesn\u2019t anger any of the major powers of nature or any of that.\u201dA somewhat dismissive hand wave accompanied that last clause, due not necessarily to lack of respect, but a state of ignorance and seeming irrelevance. No major powers of nature have interfered with Isra\u2019s business, for what Naoki considers to be good reason.\u201cFor the Minister of Primary Industries, I have selected the newest component of our government, Lait. His prior experience in managing local agriculture, combined with seemingly boundless enthusiasm, I have decided to appoint him despite his relative inexperience. It is my hope that he will perform well.\u201dWithout missing a beat, she continued, \u201cAnd, of course, everyone\u2019s favorite red-haired sorceress, Andraste Ruana, will continue to lead The Enclave and sit on the Conclave as the Minister of magic. Likewise, I will continue to handle Internal Affairs and the Treasury Department. I find being directly involved with those departments makes it that much easier to do my job, and there\u2019s nobody else qualified, so. \u2026 Yes. Such is the extent of it. If anyone is aware of any individuals who might be suited for the Education or Arts positions, please let me know.\u201dAfter offering the room another nod, Naoki seated herself, somewhat pleased that it is no longer her responsibility alone to lead these meetings. Hopefully, she would be able to simply observe the remainder of the meeting.", "1470560285000": "Without any significant fanfare, Lady Naoki makes her way into the Assembly Chamber, a folder filled with papers held under one arm. On this occasion of occasions, she has chosen to wear a rather unique garment. The beautiful lovechild of a cabled sweater and a cute red dress. Why choose between flattering one\u2019s figure and staying cozy, when one could do both? It is the ultimate garment, in Naoki\u2019s opinion. As she makes her way fully into the chamber, her tail bobs behind almost casually. She seems for all the world to be completely at ease, the very image of quiet confidence, as if this is simply another assembly meeting where she runs the show. Making her way over to the Isran table, she reciprocates eye contact where it is given, and offers small waves to some of the present guests. Trusting her entourage to follow at their own pace, she sets her folder of papers before her place at the table before seating herself, carefully crossing her legs beneath the table.After taking a moment to settle into her seat, she begins to acquaint herself with the room as it exists so far, and as to which representatives have already arrived and which have not. Idly, she wonders why Ryden chose to wear armor. Sure, it looks reasonable enough, but for such a pragmatic sort, there\u2019s no way that\u2019s comfortable. He\u2019ll be sitting down for hours on metal plates\u2026 She shrugs mentally, and turns her thoughts elsewhere. It\u2019s no bruise on her butt. ", "1470899430000": "As the other members of her table file in behind her, Naoki nods in greeting to each one as they take their respective seats. It is with some small sense of pride that she notes that the Isran table is awfully stacked in comparison to the other tables. Which, she supposes, makes sense. Given the fact that none of her associates needed to make any international journeys to attend. Even so, she thinks, even if the conference were being held in another nation, or perhaps on neutral ground, she would have her choice of which diplomats to bring or send in her place. A luxury that not many nations have; a wealth that could probably- she thinks, be attributed to some of her own choices. And furthermore, the summit is being held where it is because that\u2019s where she decided it would be held. Which is a fun sort of empowering feeling to have. Calling all of these kings out. However, she opts not to revel in it, instead turning her mind\u2019s eye to the meeting ahead, and what she plans to present.Additionally, she idly notes that the Gorain representative(s?) have yet to arrive. Keizhi and Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui. She had been told that they had arrived in Isra, and the meeting is scheduled to start shortly. She isn't quite sure whether to hope that they turn up in time or not, and returns to her internal rehersal. ", "1472884428000": "Through these proceedings, Lady Naoki opts to simply watch. Hands folded in her lap, ears pointing ahead to face the current speaker, her expression is one of polite interest and carefully maintained neutrality. Not having a need to express her own \u2018opinions\u2019 quite yet, she continues to watch and wait, observing not only the active speaker, but all those who are listening along with her. ", "1473020329000": "As she stands, Naoki offers Ryden a hard look. Only enough to visibly express her irritation, but not enough to cause another delay to the proceedings. Though the full complexity of it can\u2019t really be expressed in a single look, the primary reason for her displeasure was caused by the unnecessary friction that Ryden had helped to generate. He could have simply shut up, and everyone would be in a better mood right now to receive her proposal. She thinks that Ryden- and Renaux, to a lesser extent, could have been a bit more considerate of the atmosphere of the room and made at least a token effort to preserve it, rather than nearly starting a shouting match over quite literally one individual speaking when perhaps they should not have. Everyone here is supposed to be an adult, dammit, and it\u2019s Ryden\u2019s role to prevent such squabbling, not fuel the flames.However, Naoki\u2019s harsh look lasts only a moment before she turns to face the room at large with a carefully painted, pleasant sort of look on her face. Without turning more than a single ear, she hears Emahra rise just to her left. Naoki supposes that the proceedings so far have irritated her as well- as well they should have. Though she doubts the need for Emahra to stand, it isn\u2019t a big deal, and as such, Naoki doesn\u2019t acknowledge it, instead proceeding directly into her adress. \u201cFellow world leaders,\u201d she begins, speaking clearly and loudly enough to be heard without issue throughout the room, \u201cKings, ambassadors, representatives, and other associated individuals. I would like to make a proposal.\u201d\u201cIt should be noted that I intended to bring this proposal to everyone\u2019s attention in the absence of a higher context, and would ask that the matter of The Black Tower temporarily be tabled until a conclusion is reached on the matter I am about to propose, at which point we would be able to go back and hash out how the two resolutions might interact.\u201d\u201cWithout further ado, I would like to propose that we, as a group of leaders who wish to promote and nurture a safer and more stable world for us all to inhabit, as well as establish framework for the stable and organized international relations, begin to contemplate the implementation of international laws.\u201dHere, she pauses. The concept of international laws, as far as she\u2019s aware, has yet to be seriously discussed in any capacity. \u201cI would like to formalize this relatively informal summit to an international organization, to establish multilaterally accepted laws defining national crimes, protecting the rights of all individuals- regardless of state from government tyranny; forming a basic framework upon which we can improve and utilise to see to it that the whole world advances forward, toward the future, as opposed to backward- back into the dark days immediately following The Cataclysm.\u201d\u201cAs such, I would ask each of you representatives, each of you leaders, if you are willing and prepared to enter into such an agreement on the behalf of your peoples, and exercise your power to form a more mutually beneficial world order.\u201dAt this, Naoki pauses, awaiting responses but not seating herself. A response would be required from each nation before she would proceed- but only responses to her inquiry. ", "1473176830000": "Sept 6, 2016 7:40:40 GMT -8 Jarkoopi, Kepesk Altiui said:((Since Keizhi  is away, I'll be posting for her. It'll involve retconning that she put a communication crystal ball thing on the table though.))The whole idea of having a single branch counter such global threats was a good concept, but currently, it was poorly designed for other countries.The blue orb hummed,\"While at heart I feel this could be a great group to stand against international threats, it is much too flawed for use at its current state.\" He paused, knowing some would not like what he just stated.\"I'm afraid I have to say I share the very same concerns the king stated previously. The Black Tower has so far, and will still likely, been almost exclusively under control and funded by Isra. Although, let's say it is genuinely neutral. If it even was, whom is to say the Black Tower does not start favoring a certain government, regardless whether that favor is won through the leader's opinions, bribery or simply good charisma? What if these,'international' laws conflict with someone's sort of morals, or religion? Are they to be spat upon and killed? And whom is to keep the Black Tower in order in case of it going rouge or something of a sort? If that answer is a single country or person, then you should see where the problem lies. If each of us have an individual tower, separate from the others, it would not operate the same as another, and then we will possibly have conflicts between the two.\"The motionless orb, paused for a few seconds.\"While the offer is most intriguing, at its present form, Goraia will not be accepting of the Black Tower. I dearly hope reforms are made before such a manipulative sub-faction is put in place on a global scale.\"Listening to the responses around the room, Naoki nods, both to herself and in acknowledgement of what was said. However, when the blue orb begins to pipe up, she begins to shake her head, indicating the negative. Before anyone else can speak up, Naoki does, turning to address the orb, \u201cThere seems to be a misunderstanding. The question that I posed to the floor had nothing to do with The Black Tower. Not yet, at least; the matter has been tabled. Nobody was asking if Goraia\u00a0would accept a Black Tower Branch, such things should be worked out in a more appropriate setting between The Black Tower and whichever parties in Goraria would be responsible for such thingsTurning to glance sidelong at Tristian, she continues, \u201cAnd quite frankly, I don\u2019t very much think they would even like to. However, I would like to request a response to the question that I asked. Do you need me to repeat myself?\u201d", "1473185764000": "Still standing, Lady Naoki\u2019s face adopts an expression of ever-increasing incredulity as the orb voices its response. Opening her mouth to respond, one may think that she may begin to start screaming and ranting, but her tone is surprisingly soft and measured, though the words themselves \"I would like to examine your claim as to differences being for our betterment. You say we have been separated into states, and that such doing is natural. I would like to call to mind all the wars fought in the name of religion, King, and country, including The Cataclysm itself. Did nations then make us more peaceable? Did our differences, often so contrived as to rest solely upon devotion to a shred of cloth, promote peace or prosperity?\"Raising her hands in the air for emphasis, Naoki lets her rhetorical questions hang heavily in the air for a moment before pointing an accusatory finger in the direction of the orb and continuing, \"You say a mass will rise up. I say, let them. Anyone standing against this idea does not stand up for their own freedom or for peace, but rather out of selfishness. Any rebellion to this idea will come from those who think they know better than all of us together, united as one.\"Gesturing to the room at large, Naoki refers to all those nations which have already stated their willingness to consider her proposal and work cooperatively to define the specifics of how it will be implemented.\u201cSeeing as how the civilised world has chosen to entertain my proposal of world order, it would seem like it will be happening whether Goraia chooses to support it or not. As such, I offer you the opportunity to change your answer and make your voice heard here in the interests of the nation you represent.\u201dWith that, Naoki concludes her statements and awaits the Goraian Delegation\u2019s response, tail flicking with irritation.", "1473195673000": "Nodding in response to Averin\u2019s questions, Naoki speaks again to address his inquiries. \u201cYes, essentially so. I think that it would be best if we began by establishing a more formalised framework for more productive and efficient relations and treaties between nations to improve upon the highly informal system we\u2019re all utilising now. From there, I believe that we should decide if we would like to form some manner of league, coalition or tribunal, and regardless of if that is the case or not, I think we should proceed to implement public international laws relating to those subjects you have just mentioned, yes, such as protecting individual rights- which would presumably include outlawing slavery, outlawing genocide, and regulating the conduct of war.\u201d", "1473518998000": "More exasperated than anything else at this point, Lady Naoki stands once more to speak, only the slightest edge to her voice, \u201cIf I might.\u201dAfter waiting a moment to gather everyone\u2019s attention, she continues pleasantly, \u201cI would like to drag the topic at hand back toward productive relations between our respective nations, and specifically, between making it as easy as possible to conduct such relations in the future. Henceforth, I would like to formally invite each civilised nation present to establish an embassy here in Isra,\u201d\u201cThe Kingdom of Gauldin ,\u201d making eye contact with and offering a nod to King Renaux.\u201cLand Tillers' State ,\u201d a nod in the direction of their delegation. \u201cThe Kingdom of Alban ,\u201d a nod to King Averin.\u201cAnd the fledgling nation of Aozora ,\u201d with a nod to Warlord Shintaro Nishida, whom Naoki silently hopes will adopt another title once his nation stabilizes.Assuming that they would all accept once given the floor, she continues, \u201cI will have my people contact your respective people after the conclusion of our meeting today.\u201dWith that, Lady Naoki seats herself, folding her hands in her lap and surrendering the floor with the obvious intention of allowing another leader to do just as she has.", "1473728535000": "As the other delegates voiced their responses, Lady Naoki\u2019s mouth forms a thin line. There goes that symbolic exchange of embassies. Goodness. Quietly, she wonders. Why wouldn\u2019t Renaux or Averin accept her offer? Not returning the offer- that\u2019s understandable. Giving Naoki a legitimate excuse to have a handful of her best people right next to one\u2019s seat of government; that\u2019s very understandable, and ought to be considered carefully. But there\u2019s no harm to be done- at least not as far as Naoki sees, in any of these nations establishing an embassy in Isra. Set up a building, staff it, and bam. Easy, done. Additionally, Naoki doesn\u2019t quite remember extending invitations for anyone to come back, which is doubly perplexing. With all of that in mind, Naoki finds herself mildly irritated and somewhat confused as she takes the floor once again- none of the other present parties seemingly willing to. \u201cFair enough. Perhaps we\u2019ll return to this matter later. For the time being, I think it may be best if we began to consider these international laws we intend to institute, as it seems to have become a focus.\u201dAfter allowing a moment for her audience to process this change in topic, she continues, \u201cThough it seems a bit strange to jump directly into things, I think we should begin by asking, in the context of establishing these international laws, \u2018To whom do these laws refer?\u2019. I am of the opinion that these laws ought to refer to all sapient beings, regardless of any other factor. Are there any arguments against that, or perhaps any caveats or exceptions that may be included?\"", "1474122570000": "As Jun and Renaux voice their input, Naoki shakes her head, indicating the negative. Once they are both finished speaking, she stands to address them and begins with Jun's point.\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve made myself clear. In regards to those stone orcs, I\u2019m not proposing that we ask them to honor these standards, only that we hold ourselves- as governments and nations, to these standards. If you\u2019d like to defend yourself from those orcs, that would be fine- it would be preposterous to suggest otherwise. And likewise, if you need to remove them from an area because they are posing a substantial threat to you or your people, as so long as you\u2019re not overly cruel about it, that would also probably be alright. The only matter in which these guidelines might affect that situation is that you would presumably be discouraged from killing all of the orcs without reason. No genocide.\u201d\u201cAs for limitations on spells or weapons\u2026\u201d Naoki shrugs. \u201cI would think that they wouldn\u2019t be explicitly regulated, but rather interpreted. Nobody needs a dismembering spell, for instance, where a simpler spell would accomplish the same. Or a magic of the same sort that we\u2019ve recently witnessed, for that matter.\u201dNaoki punctuates this statement with a tilt of the head in Nyx\u2019s direction and a respectful moment of silence for the dead. After the moment, she continues, casually and with a shrug, \u201cWe may decide that such magics- if found, are illegal because the use of them would be in direct violation of the laws. And again, presumably. We\u2019ve obviously only just begun, I\u2019m only offering comments based on how I think these laws ought to be constructed- which is my personal opinion. All of this is here on the metaphorical table for discussion.\u201d\u201cHowever,\u201d Naoki continues, rounding to face Renaux and address his point, \u201cI think I may have been unclear again. To create separate guidelines in such a way would undermine the legitimacy of the concept I intend to get at. It isn\u2019t just that we- as governments, agree to respect individuals who are our own citizens, and the citizens of other nations who will, in turn, respect our citizens, but rather that we are respecting individuals, full stop.\u201dShe lets this point hang in the air for a moment before continuing, \u201cIt is my personal belief that all sapient individuals- while not perhaps precious or sacred, ought to be afforded some basic respects- and be offered some inalienable rights by the civilised nations of this world. The right to their own life. The right to be free, practice whatever religion they might care to, and not be sold into unwilling servitude. Things like that. I am not as idealistic or naive enough to suggest that we ought to end all wars forever and say that one ought not to kill even in self-defense. Simply that if violence is unavoidable, we ought to at least approach the topic of taking lives with respect for those lives we intend to take and the gravity of the action, and treat all sapient beings with some small amount of respect.\u201d\u201cAs such, creating separate sets of laws depending on to which nation- if any, an individual \u2018belongs to\u2019 is - beyond being a highly arbitrary factor to consider, completely at odds with the motion I am proposing, and as such, I am wholly against the idea. These laws we create ought to be international and the rights they give inalienable. They ought to apply to every individual- as an individual is defined, equally, without discrimination or distinction based on any factor.\u201dWith this statement firmly delivered, Naoki offers Renaux a nod- intending to show that she intends to disagree with but not disrespect him, and seats herself.", "1475474605000": "Nodding slightly, Naoki finds that she doesn\u2019t really have that much to add. However, as it seems that she\u2019s expected to take the floor, she does, standing silently for a moment before beginning- uncharacteristically hesitant. \u201cWell, I agree with Havador. What he said was entirely correct- we don\u2019t need to abuse basic rights even to do war. Furthermore, what sustains and legitimises these sorts of mutual agreements are the other involved parties. If one nation infringes upon the rights we choose as inalienable, it is the responsibility of the other involved nations to take action depending on the severity of the infraction. I don\u2019t believe that Isra would hesitate to.\u201dWith this, Naoki offers a small shrug. She doesn\u2019t quite understand what all Crovan is getting at, this seems simple enough to her, to challenge the very basis of it at this point seems out of place. \u201cRegardless, I think it about time that we sit down and begin hashing out the details\u2026\u201dGesturing, Naoki beckons the leading parties to the center of the room,  single unmarked table stands, adorned only with writing supplies. Independently of which parties choose to take part in it, Naoki takes a quill in hand and begins. Several hours and a few discarded drafts later, it is complete. Penned by Naoki\u2019s hand and broken into two portions, The International Accord of Universal Rights and Protections is born. It reads as follows. The undersigned delegates representative of all governments and powers present at this Conference, held on the Seventh of Winter's Heart do affirm and pledge their sacred honor to upholding the following statutes.Part One: Individual Rights\tArticle OneAll sapient beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights. \tArticle TwoEveryone is entitled to all the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration, without distinction of any kind, such as race, species, gender, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status.  Furthermore, no distinction shall be made on the basis of the political, jurisdictional or international status of the country or territory to which a person belongs.\tArticle ThreeEveryone has the right to life, liberty and security of person. This includes security from acts including, but not limited to, rape, excessive torture, castration, and other such mutilations. \tArticle FourNo one shall be held in slavery or servitude; slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms.  \tArticle FiveEveryone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion.Part Two: In matters of warEvery prisoner of war, defined herein as any combatant pledged in service to a country or nation who is captured by an opposing country or nation, shall be afforded several unalienable rights. These will be respected and protected by all signers of this document.1.) Prisoners of war shall not be required to surrender information aside from their basic identity to their captors. The usage of torture to involuntarily extract information from any prisoner shall not be permitted by any signing member.2.) Prisoners of war shall have their right to humane treatment reflected in their living arrangements. Running water, no less than two meals a day, and satisfactory sleeping quarters must be provided by all member countries and nations. The usage of solitary confinement for any period lasting over two (2) weeks constitutes a violation of a prisoner\u2019s right to humane treatment.     \t\ti.) In order to enforce this, an authorized neutral body must have free and unlimited     abilities to inspect any and all camps used to house prisoners of war.3.) Prisoners of war have the right to basic correspondence, limited to the sending and receiving of lettersi.) Captors retain the right to search and censor all communications, so long as such actions do not violate a prisoner\u2019s right to communication.4.) Attempts made by prisoners of war to escape their place of confinement must not be constituted as an offense deserving of punishments that would violate the prisoner\u2019s right to humane treatment.  The undue punishment of prisoners recaptured after an escape attempt, defined hereafter, constitutes a violation of a prisoner's right to humane treatment.\ti.) Torture or physical harm designed to impair movement.\tii.)  Removal of body parts.\tiii.) Mental torture designed to impair or afflict the mental capacities.5.) Prisoners of war hailing from countries or nations who have not signed this document must be afforded the basic rights as outlined above.Enforcement \tCountries and nations found to be in violation of any or all of the above shall be subjected to immediate expulsion from this body, resulting in the revoking of all protections provided by this document. Fines may also be levied, the amount of which will be determined dependent upon the severity of the transgression(s). The parties below agree to uphold the statements written above and serve as the neutral monitoring and supportive force to ensure adherence to the statutes herein.", "1475652418000": "Gently taking the quill from Nyx, Naoki approaches the document, and in a single decisive motion, is the first to place her signature at the top of the document. Taking a step back, she takes a moment to consider what has just been accomplished. An agreement of this sort, the first of its kind, would go down in history, and Naoki with it.

It\u2019s good to be the king, but it\u2019s also stressful, and tiring to be the king. The weight of the free world has been feeling especially heavy as of late, with the ever-present issue of succession, Vortua\u2019s new Duke, suspicions that assassins may be at work, and The Ball tomorrow night. It's a lot for one Empress to worry about. After being a potato for a short while, Naoki sits up and begins undoing the ties on her sandals. It\u2019s times like these that lend easily to self-reflection, but she\u2019s really just not feeling it tonight. Instead, Naoki opens the drawer of her bedside table and moves a book aside to retrieve a folded piece of paper. The edges are frayed from handling, and in places drops of water have smeared the ink. Holding it up to the light, Naoki reads it again.Naoki turns it over to continue reading.By the time she\u2019s finished reading, Naoki\u2019s hands are shaking. Setting the note aside, she rests her head in her hands and does her best to keep it together.How many times has she read that letter, and it never gets any easier. A year and a half have passed, but time hasn\u2019t healed the wound. One year, six months, and five days, or 550 days in total, if you\u2019re counting \u2014 and Naoki is. 550 days, and it still hurts just as much as the first.The question plagues her: What could it possibly be that\u2019s been evading Kate for more than a year, that wouldn\u2019t be more easily found by all the resources of Isra, and is more important than she is?It\u2019s probably some damn plant, and the idea of that led to Naoki having the decorative plants moved from her office, just because looking at them for too long would upset her. They say that\u2019s better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all. But is it better to have loved and been left for some stupid plant, than to have never loved at all? Naoki wonders. Because it certainly would be nice not to have this loneliness, sleeping alone every night. Not to feel this anger, for having been left in the first place, or this frustration, for not being able to do anything about it. It\u2019s especially frustrating for Naoki, The Empress, Unquestioned and All-Powerful Ruler of The Free World. With all her legions, all her wealth, all her mages, and her allies in places both high and low, none of it can do anything to bring Kate back.Because she could find Kate \u2014 that\u2019s the second frustrating part. She could find her, easily, it wouldn't even take Grandma an hour. But Kate doesn\u2019t want to be found, and she doesn\u2019t want to come back, and there\u2019s absolutely nothing Naoki can do to change that. The feeling of \"powerlessness\" isn\u2019t something she\u2019s used to, and it blends in with all the other feelings in just such a way that compels Naoki to curl up into the fetal position and cry herself to sleep.But there\u2019s no time for that; The Ball is tomorrow. Reaching again into the drawer, Naoki extracts a small tin and takes from it two crinkly little leaves. A sedative. She chews them thoroughly; it\u2019s the only way she\u2019ll be sleeping soundly tonight.After one last look at the letter and another sigh for good measure, Naoki blows out the last candle and settles into the conspicuously large and conspicuously cold bed, not even bothering to undress the rest of the way.

It\u2019s a look that says \u201cthey better not shit on my flowers,\u201d and she manages to convey that in a single expression.Back at the table, she sets about uncorking the bottle and pouring them each a half-glass. \u201cGo ahead, then,\u201d she prompts, \u201cLet\u2019s hear it.\u201d", "1580606136000": "Empress Naoki stares blankly at Ulfang for a long moment, gradually developing an expression of complete incredulity. \u201cAs true as the rumors that you are a eunuch,\u201d she responds, voice barely above a whisper. \u201cWait, let me show you. Stay there.\u201dStanding, Empress Naoki makes her way to a nearby bookshelf.

The amount of arrogance required to come into her home, drink her wine, and then ask that question using those words is on a level beyond anything she has ever seen before. Here sits a man who has always been the biggest in the room. Here sits a man who has never been forced to respect anyone, and who has failed to recognize the dynamic of this situation. Empress Naoki is simultaneously disgusted and insulted, and really rather angry.\u201cThere are polite ways to ask that question, and what you said was not even close to any of them.\u201d The Empress\u2019s tail lashes this way and that as she lectures Ulfang. \u201cYou made no effort to respect either my position or even worth as a person, and you used a word you know to be degrading. Remember where you are. Remember that I am not obligated to take one singular speck of shit from you, or even to speak with you in the first place!

At that point, all I would need to do to accomplish the same and more would be to send them out with a few Imperial Legions to carve out kingdoms. With a good mentor, they could probably do it in their early teens.\"Empress Naoki shrugs emphatically.

You offer great power, but the power you offer is dark, profane, entirely at odds with the sensibilities of my Empire, and unnecessary on top of that power I already have.\u201d\u201cRegardless of your qualities, intentions, or what \u2018could be\u2019, the fact remains that your Dark Arts are exactly that, and reviled throughout the land. The people of Isra would not accept a Haren ruler in the same way they accept me. Scaring them into submission or ruling through fear is entirely unacceptable, and I ought to be proof enough that the ruler of Isra does not need that manner of personal power in any case. I don\u2019t believe that any child of yours would ever be a suitable ruler for The Isran Empire, and I would be unwilling to leave it to them in any case.\u201dA beat. She looks him in the eye.\u201c...But that does not entirely preclude some manner of arrangement between us.\u201d\u201cI invite you to join me tomorrow, around noon, in The Sudatorium. I tire of speaking of this for now and promise you absolutely nothing, but we can meet again then.\u201d", "1580793374000": "\u201cI do not,\u201d Naoki confirms. \u201cThat is why I said \u2018the sensibilities of my empire\u2019 and not \u2018the sensibilities of both myself and my empire\u2019. You have it exactly right about image; if I felt as the average of all my citizens, you would have been turned away at the gate.\u201d She makes a dismissive hand gesture, lamenting that not all are as educated as she. Things would be so much easier if they were.\u201cYou are quite welcome,\u201d she responds, \u201cI shall save the rest. \u2026 Until then.\u201dEmpress Naoki nods and raises a hand in farewell to Ulfang, but remains seated as he exits and shuts the door behind himself. She stands to jam the cork back into the mouth of the wine bottle, but sits again afterward, as her glass is still half-full.", "1581306995000": "Sitting there at the table after both Ulfang and Grandma have left, Naoki holds her half-glass of wine in one hand and stares blankly out the window. Ulfang is an awful lot, in more ways than one. Much more sass than she has to put up with on a regular basis \u2014 which is none. He fancies himself her equal, and, not having refuted him, she supposes that she has made it so. At least as far as their conversations go.But what a discussion. It was only halfway through that Naoki realized that it reminded her of another, similar discussion she had with Archbishop Alured Norian, in the very same Sudatorium that she will be seeing Ulfang in tomorrow. Alured proposed to her a scheme along similar lines, where, posing as a solution to her \u201c\u201c\u201cproblem\u201d\u201d\u201d of not having yet chosen a sire for her children, he could do her that immense favor that surely no one else would be so incredibly kind as to do, and, in so doing, piggyback off her success and power to further his own aims. In that case, he was focused less on the child and more on the ramifications. It was an anti-undead, religious sort of thing, where he hoped to change Isra to impact his ideals upon the world. It was, somehow, more disagreeable than anything Ulfang brought up, due mostly to how keen he was on wiping Isra clean of the undead. That sort of low-key-genocide doesn't sit well with her, even if they weren't necessarily alive to begin with. Lots of Naoki\u2019s best friends are undead, so there was good cause to issue with his plan. She heard him out, entertained his proposal, but then when Naoki brought up Skarlet, he stormed out in a big huff and hasn\u2019t been heard from since.Now that she comes to think of it, the comparison between Alured and Ulfang is an interesting one. Both crusty old men at least three times her age looking to impregnate her and take advantage of her power. Both six-letter names beginning with a vowel followed by the letter L. Both with strong and strange opinions on the topic of death. Both quite tall, and rather intimidating. But Ulfang is muscly where Alured was lean. Alured styled himself as creepy but ultimately benevolent, but in reality had nefarious intentions. Whereas Ulfang outwardly appears not just creepy but downright evil, though it seems as though he has pure intentions at heart.Hmmh. Naoki sighs, and sips her wine.Still. It\u2019s a troublesome problem, the whole thing. Surrounded on all sides by people who want her to change for their benefit. Suitors, trying to wed her. Opportunists, trying to breed her, and others, maneuvering even now to position themselves favorably to take advantage of the power vacuum when/if she dies. And The Set, actively plotting to make it a 'when' in the near future. Even and especially: Grandma, pressuring her to Ascend and become immortal.After considering the matter for several moments, Naoki comes to the conclusion that it certainly would be fantastic if everyone could just piss off.Again, she sips her wine.And throughout it all, none to confide in. None to lean on in troubling times like these, and none that would be suitable to discuss her troubles. Those that Naoki can trust to support her have dwindled down to a paltry few, and even then they are far off, tending to their own matters. \u2026 It is during times like these, Naoki thinks, that she most misses Kate. What she had with Kate was pure and untainted in a way that Naoki doubts she will ever have again, especially considering recent events. She can relate to Ulfang and his dead wife, and sometimes Naoki wonders if...No! Catching herself, Naoki abruptly stands and stalks over to the window, her ears flattened in anger. Now is not the time for crying and self-pity. Now is the time to figure out what the hell she is going to do to sort out this flaming mess that her life has become. She will be forced to make a decision about succession eventually, and she must figure it out before that point....Scowling at the black feather sitting so arrogantly on her window, she huffs again and crosses her arms. She considers if the black feather could, perhaps, be symbolic for something in her troubles, but nothing jumps out. All is still for the space of a few moments, and then a gust of wind blows it away.", "1581308478000": "Naoki stands near the window, cupping a mug of chocolate. It\u2019s still snowing, and the accumulation in her little courtyard is truly piling up. The snowbank comes halfway up the window, and the doors to the courtyard are covered completely. So much for her flowers.Sighing, Naoki sips from her mug. Snow is beautiful in its own way, but not particularly cheerful.Having just come back from Empress-variety-errands, Naoki is now taking some time to herself before she intends to write for the remainder of the evening. There are several letters she needs to respond to, and she\u2019d like to issue an edict about the price of firewood later this week. But before then, as she now remembers, there is the small matter of her sister. Seemingly a bum, arrested a few days ago on assault charges, that someone thought it might be best to inform The Empress that this prisoner has an anklet with her name on it. The matter of her origin and family is one that Naoki has been avoiding essentially since she arrived in Isra, and the fact that Andrea has stumbled in the manner she has is troublesome in that regard. It would be easier and probably safer just to divest her of the anklet and send her on her way without so much as a glance from The Empress, but curiosity bade Naoki to see for herself. That was a few hours ago. And upon seeing her there in the cell, in such a sorry state, it was a combination of pity, loneliness, and common decency that compelled Naoki to recognize and tend to her. Now, or rather, in a few minutes, she is to meet with Andrea, and speak with her for the first time. Some words were exchanged in the prison, but this will be their first discussion, as kin.Standing there by the window, Naoki puts one hand to her stomach as she gradually becomes aware of a strange feeling. Is it poison? She sniffs her drink. Is it pregnancy? It damn well shouldn\u2019t be \u2014 not yet. It takes Naoki a bit of thinking to identify the feeling: trepidation. ", "1581320169000": "\u201cLike hell you\u2019ll keep it short. Sit down; we\u2019re going to chat.\u201d Naoki gestures to the table. \u201cI\u2019ll be right back.\u201d Approximately one minute passes.Then Naoki returns with two filled mugs and coasters held under her armpit. She hands one to Andrea, (\u201cIt\u2019s hot,\u201d) sets the coasters on the table, and takes the other seat. Cradling her mug, she blows on it several times before taking a sip. \u201cFirst of all, you can use my name. Or... the name I\u2019ve assumed, I suppose...\u201d Trailing off, Naoki looks away. That's not something she'd like to discuss.\u201cAnd don\u2019t worry about any sort of debt,\u201d she adds, waving such a silly idea away. \u201cYou would do the same if you were on the coins.\u201dFor a long moment after that, Naoki is silent, looking across the table at her newfound kin and considering how she'd like to continue.\u201cI\u2019ve been telling everyone that I had no family,\" she says, \"Because I didn\u2019t think that I did. And I\u2019ve brushed off all the questions about where I\u2019m from. I don\u2019t need to tell them, and they don\u2019t need to know.\u201dNaoki shares a look with Andrea. They know.\u201cBut, here you are, and there are no two ways about it. \u2026 I suppose I should clarify: you\u2019re not a prisoner. You can leave if you want, I\u2019m not holding you here. But it wouldn\u2019t sit right with me just to turn you back out into the street, because you have\u2026 essentially nothing, do you not?\u201d", "1581372423000": "\u201cNot quite...\u201d Naoki admits, although at one point she was close.\u201cBut we don\u2019t need to dwell on that. You and I are related in some sense of the word, and if that\u2019s enough for you, it\u2019s enough for me. \u2026 I invite you to be recognized as such and stay here as part of the Imperial Household.\u201dShe pantomimes the headline:  \u201c\u2018long lost sister of The Empress, recently found, welcomed with open arms.\u2019\u201d She sips her drink. \u201cIt will be a bit of whiplash for you, but goodness knows you\u2019re due for a change of fortune. You could live here in one of the rooms across the hall, up at my Chalet in the mountains, somewhere else of your choosing, or all of the above.\u201d She shrugs. \u201cIt\u2019s all the same to me, as I\u2019ve built all these large homes with spare rooms, but there\u2019s no one to fill them.\u201d Naoki does not outwardly say \u201cit\u2019s lonely,\u201d but it wouldn\u2019t take a genius to infer.A certain dignification has been baked into her person, but she\u2019s putting on no airs of authority and seems comparatively small in contrast to her visit to the prison as a result. ", "1581400347000": "Throughout it all, Naoki does nothing but sit quietly with a smile a mile wide. This is more wholesome than she could have possibly hoped for, and makes her glad that she didn\u2019t have the prisoner quietly disposed of. At one point, Naoki wipes something off her face, probably a bit of dust.But when Andrea goes on about her \u2018skills,\u2019 Naoki can\u2019t help but smirk. None of those are at all useful or sufficient to make a living, and that probably has a lot to do with why Andrea was in such a sorry state to begin with, but that doesn\u2019t matter now.\u201cWe\u2019ll find something for you to do,\u201d she assures Andrea, waving that concern away for later. \u201cIn the meantime, I did say \u2018open arms.\u2019 \u2026 Do you want to hug?\u201d She stands.", "1581563500000": "Being as she is, built in such a manner, warm and plush in that way that she is, and wearing a sweaterdress of the soft rather than the scratchy variety, Naoki is well suited for hugging and does so with the sort of passion and sincerity that can only be born from need.The height difference lends itself well to Naoki planting her face into Andrea\u2019s shoulder, an opportunity she takes advantage of. Further inspection of the blouse after the fact would find it somewhat damp but Naoki, either through an ingrained sense of decorum, unhealthy suppression of emotions or out of a desire for them both to not break down entirely into a sobbing heap on the floor, holds back from crying outright.  And for a few beautiful shining moments, as the snow started to fall again outside and as the tea grew cold on the table, nothing else mattered. Not her dress, not Andrea\u2019s skinniness, not thoughts of the logistics surrounding her new sister. Not the letters that need to be written, not the suitors, not the impending succession crisis, or even her entire Empire and all those that reside within. Nothing else, except for hug.\u201cThat\u2019s it, by the way,\u201d Naoki mumbles into Andrea\u2019s shoulder. \u201cYou\u2019ve figured it out.\u201d\u201cWhat can you give the woman who has everything?\u201d She squeezes a bit tighter. \u201c...Hugs.\u201d", "1581898536000": "\"How about that,\" Naoki repeats, thinking many of the same thoughts herself. \u201cIt will take some getting used to.\u201d But at the mention of red tape, she scoffs. \u201cYou forget, dear sister, that I am an absolute ruler. The government exists as an extension of my will and as a result is fairly efficient. If I say something is so, then so it will be.\u201d\u201cI will say first and foremost that you are my sister, and that you should be treated with the appropriate amount of respect. I hope you\u2019re ready to be Lady Lanne,\u201d Naoki says, lightly jesting.\u201cI\u2019ll say that you can come and go as you please from the civic portions of The Citadel and my chambers, and that you may make use of anything you please therein. \u2026 I will also assign one of my pageboys to you. Pages essentially serve as a go-between between myself and all the various parties responsible for doing things, routing requests where they need to go.  If you want for anything \u2014 anything at all, you need only ask him.\u201d\u201cShould we go pick your room?\u201d Naoki nods toward the door.", "1581997568000": "\u201cMy pages are not common rascals taken off the streets and paid a few coppers to carry messages around,\u201d Naoki starts, somewhat offended. \u201cThey are consummate professionals who have trained extensively to achieve the highest possible post they could hope to at their age.\u201d\u201cYou politely request that he send for roast chicken and some ale,\u201d Naoki corrects Andrea, boop-ing Andrea\u2019s nose with one finger. \u201cAnd they will see to it. You can\u2019t be the iron-fisted type and the rude type, it\u2019s one or the other. Disrespecting the people who handle your food is a brilliant way to get yourself poisoned, not that I would know.\u201dGesturing for her sister to follow, Naoki starts out of The Lounge and back into the entry hal. \u201cBut they can procure most anything, yes,\" she continues. \"Remember whose pages these are, and the resource pool they\u2019re pulling from. Asking to see the tailor or the stylist is fair game, but don\u2019t ask for courtesans as though they\u2019re a commodity\u2026 I only have the one anyway, and I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll be sharing her with you; you might need to get your own.\u201d Naoki smirks.\u201cBut here are the rooms,\u201d she gestures, referring to the collection of twelve or so doors branching off the entry hall. \u201cThat one we were in was the lounge, those two at the end are the latrine and guest bathing rooms, these two are guest rooms, that one is for the pages, that's the tea room, that's a little library, this one is an escape tunnel, and these remaining three are unoccupied bedrooms. They\u2019re all labeled, you\u2019ll notice.\u201d \u201cThe rooms are about as large as the lounge and ought to be fully furnished, with some subdivisions. Sitting room, bedroom, closet, nothing too fancy -- they don\u2019t have attached bathrooms or any of that. One of them has bunk beds, I believe... have a look.\u201d She gestures. \u201cIf you don\u2019t like any of these, there are others elsewhere.\u201d", "1582671518000": "In response to Andrea\u2019s questions about a live-in butler/courtesan, Naoki only quirks an eyebrow. That\u2019s something that can be addressed at a later date as a very much tertiary concern. Looking on quietly as Andrea sees the room, it\u2019s easy for Naoki to feel the part of the benevolent and generous ruler she aspires to be. When squeezed so tightly, Naoki squeaks slightly but doesn\u2019t protest. When she was ordering the design of her Chambers, years ago, she had extra bedrooms built with the thought that \u201cmaybe someone will come along later.\u201d They\u2019ve been sitting empty all this time, serving only to add to the pervasive aura of loneliness and as more dusting for the maids. Now that she's finally faced with the reality of someone actually coming along to live in them, it all feels worth it. \u201cI\u2019m glad you\u2019re happy,\u201d Naoki replies. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d Being able to provide such things so easily to those she cares for has been a large part of her motivation on her climb to the current height of her power. The sense of fulfillment fits in quite nicely along with the rest. Eventually, they part. \u201cAre you tired?\u201d She asks, \u201cHungry? We should tour around some and make introductions, but you may want to get settled first, get a good meal in.\u201d", "1538453204000": "Alured would find the interior of The Sudatorium to be as the pageboy described it with one notable addition: there\u2019s An Empress sitting in it. There, upon one of the benches, wrapped in one towel, sitting on another, hair tied back, Lady Naoki sits, looking about as smug as one might expect given the situation.\u201cWelcome,\u201d she says, eyeing Alured up as she did once before. \u201cShut the door, if you would, and have a seat.\u201dShe gestures to the other bench and gives him a moment to seat himself and acclimate to the heat. \u201cI\u2019ll admit, I was surprised to hear that you came.\u201d", "1538455892000": "\u201cYesss,\u201d she responds, referencing his absence. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard much about you recently.

There\u2019s a certain sort of nuance you have there \u2014 with that mask of yours and the focus on death, as opposed to something simple and agreeable like sun worship. It works well enough as it is \u2014 a minority, but I\u2019m unsure if the people of Isra as a whole will accept Varafel as their deity in any timeframe whatsoever \u2014 just due to the features of the religion and the variety of Isra's peoples. A large part of what you mean to get at involves those outside the city adopting the religion wholeheartedly, and it will be difficult to spread its reach far beyond a day\u2019s walk of a cathedral.\u201d\u201cAnd then, if we\u2019re going to dot the countryside with cathedrals, we could also be doing something else with a more tangible benefit. That leads to logistical questions and issues putting values on things that cannot be assigned value, and so on. There\u2019s much room for skepticism in considering the viability.\u201d A hand wave dismisses the rest of that line of thinking.The Empress, in her infinite mercy, refrains from expressing doubt in Alured\u2019s ability to put a child in anything, instead skipping to a more serious matter.\u201cThere\u2019s also the not-so-small matter of The Church's stance on undead.\u201dPausing, The Empress gives Alured a weighted look intended to communicate that she does not approve, and may or may not know more than she lets on.\u201cA good number of my friends are not alive in the traditional sense,\u201d she begins, watching his face for a reaction. \u201cIncluding my artificer, and The Imperial Princess Skarlet.\u201d \u201cDid you know that?\u201d", "1580959271000": "Empress Naoki, not being one to enter rooms that others are already in, is herself already in The Sudatorium. She sits squarely in the center of the middle bench, resting her elbows on the bench behind. She wears a towel wrapped about under her arms, has her hair tied up in a second towel, and is sitting on a third. (As it\u2019s rude to sweat directly on the wood.)Earlier, she asked that Timothy make himself available to Ulfang von Haren to guide him to The Sudatorium. Though she didn\u2019t mention and he didn\u2019t ask of its location at the time of invitation, The Sudatorium is reasonably well-hidden amongst The Citadel\u2019s corridors, and entirely unlabeled. It wouldn\u2019t do to have her guest asking about for directions, so hopefully, Timothy will be able to handle the matter.In the meantime, Naoki is getting her sauna time in and collecting her thoughts. The Sudatorium is an excellent location for meditation, and she has much to meditate on.", "1581051165000": "\u201cMy rest was well,\u201d Empress Naoki replies, looking up at Ulfang as he enters the room. \u201cI took the remainder of the day off to ruminate and consult with my experts.\u201dThe compliment flies unacknowledged, though it\u2019s unclear if this is intentional, meant to come off as cool, or if Naoki is simply distracted by the awe-inspiring view Ulfang has presented her with. An elongated moment passes with only the sound of water hissing on the rocks before Naoki murmurs appreciatively. \u201cSuffice it to say,\u201d she begins, looking up to make eye contact. \u201cI think we\u2019ll be able to reach an understanding. But let us leave such talk for later, as you said you wished to know me. There may be places better suited to becoming acquainted than a sauna, but not many, and today was sauna-day anyway. Were it anywhere else we would also both need to be more heavily clothed, and so here we are.\u201d She gestures carefully as not to dislodge her towel.\u201cTo begin, since you've mentioned it, why not tell me more of your Vale? I have not the benefit of your small bird-friends, so I am all but entirely ignorant of what lies beyond your mountain pass.\u201d", "1581055147000": "Naoki hums in acknowledgment, picturing what it must be like to be surrounded on all sides by mountains. To those who enjoy it there, it must be rather comforting, but she suspects there are probably more than a few who see the mountains more as an element of oppression that keeps them in, than a protective wall that keeps enemies out. Of course, she does not mention this, but the thought jumps immediately to mind.\u201cIt is,\u201d she assures him, waving away his concern. \u201cThe topology of your homeland is not what interests me.\u201d\u201cThough it does sound rather pleasant,\u201d she supposes. \u201cI have never been particularly attuned to the forest myself, but it is impossible not to appreciate the sort of vibrant, untamed nature you describe. Unfortunately, it is one of the few things the city actively lacks, and many, myself included, have grown disaccustomed to seeing.\u201d", "1581134196000": "Again, Naoki hums. \u201cPerhaps,\u201d she responds, \u201cPerhaps. You make it sound magnificent, there is no doubt of that.\u201dFollowing this, Naoki is quiet for a long moment, unsure of how to proceed. She looks to the rocks, to the man sitting opposite her, and then down just a bit.\u201cVery good,\u201d she supposes. \u201cYou have questions, do you not?\u201d", "1581141334000": "\u201cMmh, no, I preferred it the first way\u2026\u201dTrailing off, she gathers her thoughts.\u201cThis entails a bit of storytime: \u2026 I was here, not quite at the city\u2019s initial founding, but not long after. I had essentially nothing and, compared to what it has become, The Free City was hardly anything at all. I was presented with the opportunity to assume management of a dingy little bar called \u2018The Midnight Sun\u2019, for reasons that remain unclear to me to this day. Suffice it to say that I did quite well. We made gold hand over fist, and I gradually grew the business and organization into much more than a mere tavern.\u201d\u201cIt wasn\u2019t very long that I found myself with those things which I had lacked, gold and allies, in grand abundance. It became a sort of a game to see how much gold I could make and how wide I could extend my influence. And what I found was that as I accumulated wealth and power, I was better able to provide for those fellow demihumans who found themselves much as I had. I inducted them into the organization, gave them jobs, gave them purpose, put clothes on their backs, fed them, and gave them a warm bed to sleep in -- all those things that were never given to me.\u201d\u201cI found all this to be immensely gratifying. It appeals to that base part of my psyche that compels humans to cooperate toward the greater good. I get off on receiving gratitude in that manner, and the associated luxuries were an excellent bonus.\u201d\u201cThe scope of those I took responsibility for continued to grow, as did my power to care for them. There was a point at which none in Isra could oppose me, and another where I effectively gained control of the city. When I was elected Lady of The Free City, it was mostly a formality, but it actualized my duty to protect. At that moment I became responsible for the lives of every man woman and child living in Isra, and I carry that duty to this day.\u201d\u201cSince then, I have dramatically increased both my power and the number of lives I take responsibility for, but my underlying motivations remain the same. Throughout my Empire, there are millions of Isran citizens who, whether they outwardly recognize and appreciate it or not, owe the very basis of their lives to me. They sleep soundly at night protected by the armies I raise. Their homes were built by the programs I organized. They bathe in the bathhouse I paid from my own pocket to construct, and I have even gone so far to provide food to those who have none.\u201d It goes on, but she doesn\u2019t.\u201cI have done good in this world,\u201d Naoki asserts, \u201cAnd I feel good about it.\u201d\u201cAt this point, it has become less of a choice and more of a compulsion, because I must continue to work as hard as I do to keep it all from falling apart, but I have become affectionate toward this Empire I\u2019ve built and these people I\u2019ve raised. As it stands, I am the only one who can do what I do, and so I continue for their sake.\u201d", "1581146976000": "Naoki has yet to hear anything about how much Ulfang loves his people, enough so that they are forced to donate blood and denied from all but the most menial of tasks to support his undead regime. Somehow, she suspects that his dedication to doing what must be done keep his people \u2018safe and content\u2019 has more to do with culling the weak and slaying foes than it does tax paperwork or beauracracy, but whatever. She notices every time, but Naoki has committed to aggressively ignoring those sorts of distasteful bits.\u201cOh, as a matter of fact, yes, it is! Quite exhausting!\u201d She is highly enthusiastic in so saying, but the sarcasm is light, comes from pain, and is intended mostly in jest.\u201cMy earring here,\u201d she says, pointing to it, \u201cYou may already be aware: it enables a sort of telepathy. I used to use it more extensively to communicate with all the various personnel back at The Sun, but now it functions to me messengers barging it at all hours and allows me to issue orders and receive reports remotely. It is a brilliant convenience, but the real secret is delegation. I could go on about that, but don\u2019t care to.\u201dIgnoring the misstep, she continues directly to the followup question. \u201cThe polite answer to that question is such that I read extensively and practice archery \u2014 and I do. I have several extensive libraries and consider the knowledge I have gained through reading to be an essential component of my ability to lead effectively. \u2026 The archery is more of a token pursuit and honestly largely irrelevant, save for this exact circumstance.\u201d\u201cThe accurate answer, for what I prefer to do, is to 'spend time with' my close friends and courtesans. It is the best way I have found to relieve stress, and I\u2019ve been told I\u2019m quite good at it. I could go further, but I wouldn\u2019t want to make you blush.\u201d At this, Naoki winks and employs just the most gentle touch of her foul lust magic, intending only to get a slight rise out of Ulfang \u2014 or more accurately, his towel.", "1581224429000": "Naoki, for her part, smirks devilishly. She watches Ulfang and his eyes, and when he looks back up, she winks at him again. The difference between tact and subtlety is itself a subtle difference, but it is clear that Naoki employs one but not the other.\u201cMore than it should have, perhaps,\u201d she replies, \u201cBut not any less than it was intended to.\u201d The direction this conversation is taking suits her well, but what he says next gives her pause. She hadn\u2019t yet given very much thought to what manner of life Ulfang here might lead, aside from one that involves lots of battle and necromancy, repeated ad infinitum. But here is one whose family has died and has for company only soulless husks and a handful of lieutenants.\u201c... It must be quite lonely up there,\u201d Naoki remarks, looking at Ulfang with a newfound pity. \u201cLonely... and cold, and wholly devoid of cozy things like... cinnamon buns, or hugs.\u201dHaving gone on about her compassion mere moments ago, it\u2019s impossible not to feel bad for this big scary bear of a man. Big and scary (and girthy) as though he may be, he\u2019s a man \u2014 a human, with needs, just like the rest of them. He didn't necessarily ask to be who he is, but here he is regardless, all lonely and likely quite pent up. It isn\u2019t necessarily that Naoki was unaware of this fact, but the pity comes more easily when he calls attention to it in such a vulnerable state.\u201cWhy, I bet you don\u2019t even have a masseuse, do you?\u201d Naoki\u2019s tone is both concerned and chastising, as though the fact is irresponsible on his part.", "1581314526000": "It is Naoki\u2019s turn to chuckle as Ulfang stumbles over his words and starts to go red. He reminds her of Keph, she realizes. \u201cOh, no no, I would be all too happy to,\u201d she assures him, rising to her feet. \u201cIn fact, there is oil here for exactly this occasion!\u201d Naoki doesn\u2019t bother to hide her enthusiasm in taking it from the cabinet. \u201cOf course, usually you would lie down, but you\u2019re bigger than all the tables anyway, so sit right there,\u201d she tells him, stepping up onto the bench. He\u2019s exactly where she wants him.Doling out some oil, Naoki rubs it between her hands. It smells vaguely of mint. \u201cYou said you wished to know me, yes? Well, know this: I am an excellent masseuse.\u201dWith that she begins, giving the muscles around Ulfang\u2019s neck and shoulders a few experimental pushes and prods. Her hands, reasonably-proportioned as though they may be, seem rather small in comparison to the vast expanse of manflesh before her. She hums. This will take a while.\u201cIt\u2019s not a skill I often have the opportunity to practice,\u201d she continues, starting to work over his shoulder, \u201cBut it is one I have nonetheless. \u2026 I can also juggle.\u201d", "1581370281000": "\u201cOh I\u2019m sure,\u201d Naoki replies, kneading at Ulfang\u2019s shoulder. Even when she pushes and leans into it, it seems as though he doesn\u2019t budge, making her job that much easier. She proceeds methodically about her task, moving one side to the other and back, occasionally pausing for more oil. But the silence does not suit her. \u201cAll of these scars have stories,\u201d Naoki says, tracing one with her finger. \u201cTell me a good one.\u201dAdmittedly, it\u2019s a ruse to get him talking so that she might knead some amusing noises out of him. But who would he be to deny a request to relate one of his glorious tales of battle, of which there are undoubtedly many?", "1581397449000": "Naoki, for her part, is having an absolute whale of a time and doesn\u2019t pause for an instant. Like putty in her hands \u2014 but it\u2019s tough, scarred putty and hands blessed by the gods themselves. When he moans, she can barely suppress a giggle. If she can do this with her hands to his back... prospects are good.\u201cYou mobilized your army, but it was small with no airborne units,\u201d she reminds him. ", "1581565813000": "Naoki listens silently to Ulfang\u2019s story, continuing about her task in her tender, methodical fashion. Kneading, pressing, massaging, working 40 years\u2019 worth of stress out of his muscles. But the massage abruptly stops, her hands frozen mid-motion, as she hears someone in the changing room. There damn well shouldn\u2019t be anyone in the changing room \u2014 if there is that means something\u2019s wrong! But her alarm turns to pleasant surprise as the door opens and Naoki sees who it is.\u201cOh! Haru!\u201d Chuckling to herself, Naoki picks up where she left off. Seeing as how the two haven\u2019t met, she feels it appropriate to make introductions. \u201cSpeaking of magnificent beasts: Haru, this is Ulfang, King of The Black Vale. And Ulfang, this is Haru, Soft Kitty.\u201d She nods to each of them in turn. Peeking up over Ulfang\u2019s shoulder, Naoki watches with no small amount of amusement as Haru flops himself d i r e c t l y across Ulfang\u2019s lap. The whole bench groans in protest! It was determined early on that she is far too delicate for such treatment \u2014 Haru is no small cat. Usually, he flops adjacent to her, but Ulfang here has a very sturdy lap indeed.\u201cHe would like you to pet him,\u201d Naoki oh-so-helpfully offers.", "1581635293000": "\u201cHe entered Isra from the north,\u201d Naoki replies. \u201cHe flew down from the mountains, I believe. I met him near the northern gate, and we got on well.\u201d\u201cI think it has to do with the ears,\u201d she continues, paying some attention now to Ulfang\u2019s spine. \u201cHe understands common, but doesn\u2019t listen to anyone other than me \u2014 and even then, only some of the time. As far as I\u2019m aware Haru is unique upon this world, and I am glad to have him, as he is terribly soft and a very nice kitty. \u2026 Look at how long he is!\u201d Again, Naoki chuckles, astounded by Haru\u2019s magnificent length. The room is hardly large enough.\u201cBut continue,\u201d she urges Ulfang, wanting to hear the rest of the story. \u201cBorog convinced Ranyaro to help you, then what?\u201d", "1581665408000": "Naoki is silent throughout Ulfang\u2019s story and for a period afterward. There seems nothing appropriate to say following such an epic tale, and she was enraptured to such a degree that her licentious intentions have been sidelined for the time being.\u201cIf I still ran The Midnight Sun,\u201d she says at last, \u201cI would hire you to tell your tales up on the stage. Hearing the tale firsthand adds much, and you tell it well. If you truly wish to do all that you can to rebuild your country, you could realistically make a pile of gold tutoring bards or in someplace like The Starlight Dawn.\u201dDuring this time, Naoki has worked her way back and forth across Ulfang\u2019s broad shoulders several times and has reached a natural stopping point. She isn\u2019t finished by any means, but her hands need a break. Sliding over to the left where there\u2019s a bit more room, she stretches her legs, which were drawn so tightly to her, and sighs a contented sigh.\u201cIt is an injustice that your tales are not in my library,\u201d she adds. \u201cAnd perhaps at some point, we could rectify that. Paper and quill, two comfy chairs, a fireplace, perhaps some drinks. If you have other tales of similar quality, I\u2019d much like to hear them someday.\u201d\u201cIn the meantime,\u201d she continues, \u201cI feel as though that was an equitable exchange, all said. I\u2019ve only addressed your neck and shoulders, but for me to go any... lower, it would be much easier for you to be lying down.\u201d This is very much a hint, but it seems as though Naoki is in no paticular rush.", "1581831124000": "\u201cI suppose so,\u201d Naoki says, rising. She looks at Ulfang\u2019s outstretched hand for an extended moment but declines to take it. Instead, she nods her head toward the door. \u201cGo put something on and let Timothy take you up to the Den,\u201d she says, tail starting to swish behind her. \u201cI\u2019ll be up soon enough. I have something to do in the meantime, and you may wish to wash.\u201dWhether or not the last remark was made in jest or not is unclear, but then Naoki doesn\u2019t tend to be in circumstances such as these. The Sudatorium is no larger than the room they\u2019re standing in, and she figures such that if they\u2019re going to go somewhere, they may as well take it all the way up to The Den and do things properly. ", "1442929695000": "<Madame Naoki and Artemis enter, from The Conjunction.>\"They were a bit cranky, weren't they? Wonder if it's their time of the month.\"Naoki takes a moment to survey the Keep Hall, ears tilting and turning to take inventory of the assembled personages, checking to see if she spots anyone she knows. She glances at a window, where the sun can be seen, dipping down towards the twilight hours.\u00a0She nudges Artemis, grasps her left wrist with her right hand, and flicks her left ear, which causes her earring to glint, reflecting the sun into Artemis' eye.Cresno hasn't submitted his scheduled status upate.Naoki raises an eyebrow, inquiring what Artemis thinks about that.", "1442930702000": "Naoki responds with a simple shake of her head. \"I think it was.

", "1443278116000": "Madame Naoki cringes mentally as she shakes Walter's hand. \"Ah, yes, well, I'm looking to get the who's-who around here. I would like someone knowledgeable about the high class around here to point out the figures of note. And you look like a good place to start.\"", "1452038180000": "As Madame Naoki makes her way through The Citadel towards The Keep Hall, an astute observer would notice a number of small changes take place regarding the way she carries herself. The settling of her paces into a straight and regular rhythm, the drawing back of her shoulders, a distinct increase in height, even. She leverages her abilities of self presentation and posture to imbue an air of dignified confidence into each movement. Upon entering The Keep Hall, she approaches the location where she presumes Ildesias would be seated, swiveling her ears around to attune to the noisy environment. Seeing that Ildesias is currently occupied, and not being rude enough to interrupt, she stops a respectful distance away, and with a motion of her hand, brings her party to a stop behind her, deciding to spend her time waiting to gather her thoughts.Naoki hasn\u2019t yet met Ildesias. She had intended to introduce herself on her previous visit to The Citidel, but the crisis that brought her back to The Sun had prevented any such meeting. She had unknowingly stood beside Ildesias as he was doing his clandestine investigation of The Sun, and had even paused to examine the unique delicacy he was served, but Naoki had failed to recognize him at the time. And, though he may recognize her from that encounter, Demonlord Maelik had declined to notify her after the fact, so she was unaware of the event.She muses how to be best to introduce herself. There are a small handful of titles that would be applicable, but Naoki has always found it presumptuous when individuals, in introducing themselves, list all of their titles and skills. Just pick the most important one, maybe two, and leave it at that. At least as far as introductions go. Just the titles that are relevant to the business you intend to conduct with the other individual; nobody likes a show-off. But which one of hers would be best to use in this situation? Probably just \u2018Owner of The Midnight Sun\u2019. That carries enough connotations to imply most of the rest, she supposes. She assumes that with how major The Sun is at this point, Ildesias would have to be pretty blind to not have heard of it. And she had no reason to suggest that he was so blind to the happenings within his city. In fact, what she\u2019s heard of the Elven Lord has been almost entirely positive. Overall, she is content with what she knows of his management of the city she's made her life in.Madame Naoki, Artemis, Skarlet and Cyronin stand up against a wall a respectful distance away as Ildesias conducts his business. Naoki had given Skarlet and Cyronin a two-minute seminar on basic etiquette on the carriage ride over, in the hopes they wouldn\u2019t embarrass themselves too much. She plans to approach once Ildesias\u2019 current visitors have concluded their business and departed. Aware of how telling the orientation of her ears is, she keeps them aimed forward, or to the side away from Ildesias. Though she\u2019s curious as to the topic of conversation, she wouldn\u2019t care to be known first as an eavesdropper. ", "1452056715000": "Madame Naoki goes aside with Grandma, and listens quietly as Grandma speaks her piece. Bearing in mind her surroundings, Naoki does her very best to contain her emotions. Though, her very best wasn\u2019t quite enough. Grandma may notice the fires of rage strike and roar in her eyes, below downward pointed eyebrows. Those around her might hear the rapid tapping of her foot on the ground, notice her trembling shoulders, or her fists clenching and unclenching repeatedly. It is a long moment before she is composed enough to respond aloud. When she does, her words are short, sharp, almost spat -though her voice remains low.\u201cI see. Thank you.\u201dOne trembling hand reaches up, and touches Naoki\u2019s earring. It remains there for another long minute, as she sends a long series of instructions back to headquarters. Action would be taken, and it would be taken now.Addressing Grandma again, she tilts her head in the direction of Ildesias, indicating him as the subject of her next sentence. \u201cI trust you\u2019ll inform the relevant authorities of this\u2026\u201d she searches for the phrase that would be most applicable to the event.\u201c...this act of aggression against the nation of Isra?\u201d", "1452065229000": "Noting the look on Grandma\u2019s face, a small smirk breaks across Naoki\u2019s face. She remembered the last time Grandma had looked like that, and the events that had followed. It was comforting to know that they were... of like mind regarding that impudent dragon. To think that it could threaten Kate, of all people, and get away with it! It either lacked the due amount of respect, or was simply too stupid to recognize the full implications of its actions. Whatever the case may have been, Naoki thinks, it had chosen the wrong individual to imperil.With that small, angry smirk in place, Madame Naoki gives Grandma a short nod of acknowledgement. She decides to be content with the orders she issued, choosing to trust in the associates she chose to prevent any further incidents; at least until she could finish with her business here at The Keep Hall. Regaining full control of herself, Naoki returns to her spot on the wall next to Artemis, and folds her hands behind her back. A small glint of flame persists in her eyes, an indication of fury yet to be had. She decides to wait for Grandma to speak her piece to Ildesias before inserting herself, surrendering her position in the queue to a matter more important than anything she herself had to bring up. Such a move might also allow Grandma the opportunity to introduce her, which wouldn\u2019t be the worst thing, she supposes.", "1452306124000": "Madame Naoki nods, waving to Grandma as she exits. She appreciated that Grandma had come to inform her personally, and that she had contributed to Kate\u2019s aid. Naoki stands, lost in thought for another moment or so before remembering what she was supposed to be doing. With a small start, she snaps back into the moment, straightening her posture and approaching Ildesias. She performs a mild curtsy, and introduces herself. \u201cI am Madame Naoki, owner of The Midnight Sun. It\u2019s a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Lord Ildesias.\u201dNiceties out of the way, Naoki stands up straight, and gets directly to the point. \u201cI have two matters I would like to bring to your attention today. The first of which, is my friend here, Cyronin the Blue.\u201dShe gestures to Cyronin, and waves him forward. \u201cHe was at one point, a distinguished member of a since-fallen country\u2019s armed forces. He has considerable experience in the relevant fields of military command, swordsmanship, and the like. Cyronin can speak to his qualifications to a fuller extent than I can, but I brought him here because he\u2019s looking to find a similar position. I would like to offer him into the service of the Isranian Army.\u201d", "1452317282000": "\u201cExcellent. The second matter I would like to inquire about is is as thus\u2026\u201dNaoki pauses, taking a moment to carefully select words. \u201cI am interested in taking part in the decision-making process of the government. I would like to begin moving through the appropriate channels to become a member of The Ministry.\u201dShe pauses here, waiting to see how Ildesias reacts before going any further. ", "1453087394000": "Naoki thinks for a moment, considering the outlaid options. She certainly wouldn\u2019t willingly participate in any sort of sponsorship or apprenticeship program. At least, not with someone who didn't already owe her a larger debt. If she owed someone like Ildesias any sort of debt, that would mean that The Midnight Sun, as a group, would also be indebted. Naoki finds herself categorically opposed to involving unwilling individuals in her business. There was an option in Wallace. He was easily manipulable enough.  But she didn\u2019t really want to be associated with that sleaze. As she well knows, first impressions are incredibly important.. And to be introduced as \u201cprot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Wallace\u201d? Completely unacceptable; anyone who is acquainted with the bumbling fool would immediately form a negative opinion of her. Alternatively, she could have Grandma sponsor her. But Grandma had just left, it would be inconvenient to call her back. And that would probably count as a form of nepotism, besides. Perhaps the best option to fall back on, but not ideal. It would be more beneficial to come into power separately, and have Grandma as an 'unaffiliated' staunch ally of her proposals, rather than being supported by one's 'mentor'. Being elected by the district would be beyond trivial. If her memory serves, the city district The Midnight Sun is located in isn\u2019t home to very many, and those who do live there mostly belong to two primary groups. Midnight Sun associates, and people who owe The Sun a debt. To leverage such a community to vote for her would be exceptionally easy to do. However, those elections aren\u2019t held terribly often. And that would also appoint her as the official of the district, replacing ole\u2019 Geoffrey. But he serves his purpose well, and she wouldn\u2019t like to take over his duties. That left the third option. \u201cI would prefer to earn a new position on the Assembly of my own merit, performing some job or service, rather than displace one of the fine individuals currently in it. I have a rather sizable repertoire of skills that might be applicable. Economics and finance, diplomacy and manipulation, reading and writing. Many of the skills I use to run The Sun would translate well, I think. Additionally, my organization has information and contacts in quality and quantities that are, quite simply, unmatched. I could very easily apply my information to the benefit of Isra and The Assembly. All of the gossip that passes within my walls also makes its way to my ears.\u201dNaoki waggles her ears to emphasize her last statement.", "1464704995000": "The delegation only needs to wait a handful of moments before Madame Naoki enters the Keep Hall from the doors in the rear. One downside of wearing casual attire around The Citadel would seem to be such that if important dignitaries turn up, one must first change to meet them, hence her delay. However, one with semi-standard human recognition of beauty and appreciation of the feminine form might argue that the wait was well worth it. For this event, Naoki has chosen to wear a crimson, diaphanous number, sleeveless and backless, with Isra\u2019s Sun emblem emblazoned across her stomach. After taking a moment to take stock of the situation, she begins to move forward with confident steps.Artemis follows slightly behind and to Naoki\u2019s right, and as she moves toward the front of the Keep Hall, certain high ranking officials break off from their waiting positions to form a semicircle behind her. For as utterly un-rehearsed as it all is, the effect is rather pleasing. Madame Naoki comes to a stop just before Paralol\u2019s group and nods her head in greeting. Her tail hangs at a roughly 45\u00b0 angle behind her, swaying slightly, but not otherwise calling attention to itself. She seems completely unfazed by the group\u2019s appearance. But as irregular as it is, she\u2019s dealt with stranger stuff. In a pleasant sort of measured tone befitting to the status she speaks from, she addresses Paralol. \u201cI am Lady Naoki, and allow me to extend our warmest welcomes to you on the behalf of the Isran peoples and government. It\u2019s always good to see more peoples of the world come together in peace.\u201dHere, she pauses. It would probably be polite to allow the figure to introduce themselves and state their intentions before continuing or suggesting that they continue. ", "1465101927000": "Madame Naoki nods before responding, \u201cThat\u2019s sort of what Isra is about. The whole open arms mentality and such. Anyway, let\u2019s have a seat, and you can tell us of your nation.\u201dGesturing to one of the long tables, Naoki takes a seat at the head. Artemis takes a position behind and to her right, leaving the remainder of the seats open for Paralol, his guards, and the assembled ministers to seat themselves. She figures that this is as fine a format as any for being introduced to the nation of Belrow. Sitting at the same table and all that. Give the other ministers an opportunity to hear, and if negotiations need to be done behind closed doors, that can happen later. For now, they would learn of the basics of Belrow. ", "1466248027000": "Glancing around the table, Lady Naoki comes to realize that none of her coworkers are going to offer a response, and after musing over the proposal for a moment longer, opens her mouth to offer one of her own. \u201cWell, I see no issue with such open borders and other such mutually prosperous agreements. They will obviously need to be worked out in  more detail and ratified by the Assembly, but I\u2019m amicable to the concept. As for the second prong of your proposition\u2026\u201dShe trails off for a moment longer, thinking. \u201cWhat all do you mean by that, specifically? What manner of assistance do you require from Isra? Overseers? Labor crews? Assuming that this agreement works out exactly as you might like it to, what all would be involved with it?\u201dWith this said, Naoki steeples her fingers and leans back slightly in her chair, an expression of tempered confusion across her face. She genuinely doesn\u2019t quite grasp what Paralol is getting at, and would appreciate elaboration. ", "1466516139000": "Lady Naoki nods thoughtfully, contemplating. This is an interesting proposal indeed, that has been brought to her attention. Belrow wishes to make use of Isra\u2019s minds to uncover the ruins of their lost cities, and wish to provide metals in return. Lending them this manner of aid in an official capacity would be a somewhat decisive move on the geopolitical stage. It would be helping Belrow grow. It would be assisting them in strengthening themselves. Strength which could in turn potentially be turned against whoever Belrow deems their enemy.Which isn\u2019t to say that Naoki doubts their motives. But words are easily spoken, and they\u2019ve already admitted to possessing necromancy magics far surpassing that of any Isran mage. Which- again, isn\u2019t necessarily to say that necromancy magics are automatically indicative of malicious intent. But still. If Isra assists Belrow in earnest, digging up their cities and directly enabling Belrow to strengthen itself, and then Belrow turns about and wages war upon some innocent nation, that would be quite the awkward situation. The sort of thing to get one indicted. As such, Naoki figures it prudent to proceed cautiously, and get a better image of Belrow\u2019s intentions before committing Isra to anything as serious as what Paralol is requesting. But\u2026 how to accurately gauge their motives? All traditional conventions of reading individuals- in which Naoki is well versed, don\u2019t quite work when the other individual is essentially a particularly powerful soul inhabiting a body that wasn\u2019t initially their own and lacks half of its face. She simply can\u2019t read an undead in the same way she can most living creatures. \u201cHmm. Isra would most definitely be interested in any such mutually prosperous deal, but what you\u2019re proposing would be a very complicated affair to undertake, both politically and logistically. I cannot commit in earnest without first consulting The Assembly and some of my advisors. Would you be willing to speak on the behalf of your nation at the next upcoming Assembly meeting?\u201d", "1466631105000": "Lady Naoki nods thoughtfully once again. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll look forward to meeting him, then. That\u2019s going to be quite the event\u2026\u201dShe trails off, nodding thoughtfully to herself as she momentarily contemplates the logistics of the upcoming international summit. However, she snaps back to reality after a moment, again addressing Paralol. \u201cWell, usually at this point we\u2019d have a feast. Considering that you don\u2019t eat and I just had lunch, I think we can safely skip that portion of the procedure. Unless you\u2019d prefer to, it makes little difference to me. Which would then take us right into either the technical diplomatic talks- the hashing out of our agreements, or the gift exchange. Do you have a preference, or?...\u201d", "1472285019000": "Lady Naoki sits in Keep Hall, at one of the long feast tables that run the length of the room. Across from her, a fairly well dressed gentleman sits, and is speaking passionately, gesturing with his arms, almost yelling, and making quite sure that Naoki is receiving everything he\u2019s putting down. He is, as it turns out, a Minister of The Assembly, attempting to convince Naoki to champion a law he\u2019s gone and thought up. Naoki is sitting there, across from the man, totally unamused. Truthfully, she takes the man for something of an idiot, and his idea for the ravings of a madman. His law is, as she sees it, would be nice, on the condition they had an infinite amount of money to support such trivial things. But they do not, and as such, the money will continue to be spent on things that Isra requires to function. However, the last time she had told someone to stuff it after hearing their premise and findt inane, other politicians gave her flak for it. She told them to stuff it too, but has resigned herself to hearing out this buffoon, at least. Unfortunately enough for her, it doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s planning on concluding anytime soon. ", "1472364414000": "Turning to face the outrider as he approaches and speaks his bit, Naoki listens carefully, completely ignoring the man across from her, who continues to drone on.\u201cIs it, now.\u201dMoving to stand from her seat, Naoki seems almost pleased to have something interesting to do with her afternoon. \u201cWell, that sounds like something needs to be dealt with. Leonard!\u201dAt the call, a pageboy standing off at one side crocks his head to one side in inquiry. Leonard, evidently. It would seem as if he is mute.\u201cSee that this man is taken care of,\u201d Naoki gestures to the outrider. With that and not so much as a \u2018Goodbye\u2019, Naoki strides from the Keep Hall, leaving the outrider, the politician, and the pageboy with only each other\u2019s company. The page would, as instructed, see to it that the outrider received a square meal, the opportunity to rest in one of The Citadel\u2019s guest quarters, and whatever other sorts of miscellaneous amenities he might require before escorting him from The Citadel. The politician, for as obnoxious as he has been up until this point, at least has the decency to recognize the importance of this situation, and nods quietly to himself before taking his papers and trudging back to whatever dingy hole he came out of.

Those who would normally be loitering have duties that have drawn them elsewhere or else have opted simply to stay out of the way. A few knots of individuals sit or stand, sharing conversations, meals, or both, but by and large, the Keep Hall is relatively unoccupied. However, down at the end of one of the tables that run the length of the room, Lady Naoki sits alone. Before her on the table is what would seem to be a plate , and on that plate, there appears to be a slab of meat. Knife in one hand, fork in the other, she proceeds meticulously about devouring it, cutting off cubes of meat and putting them into her mouth. She eats quickly, with little regard for the other inhabitants of the room or the table manners that might be expected in Le Palais des Ailes.

Silently placing the fork down next to her plate, she turns halfway about on the bench to face him, chewing her mouthful as he speaks his bit. After he does, the Keep Hall goes even quieter than it had been previously, every set of eyes present trained on Naoki and Tyrus. Somewhat uncomfortable in the sudden and unexpected scrutiny, Naoki shifts a bit in her seat.

I\u2019m a citizen who has been democratically elected- not any sort of God-King\u2026\u201d Trailing off, she wipes her mouth with a cloth and turns to face Tyrus properly, wherever he may have seated himself or stands.  \u201cIf you would like to serve in the armed forces, I\u2019m not going to deny you the opportunity.

For the events of today, she has chosen to wear a red garment\u00a0with golden trim. It\u2019s fittingly regal, but not necessarily the most modest, putting it on par with the rest of The Empress\u2019 wardrobe.

Some she knows, others she does not, but none immediately jump out as double-very interesting. \u201cWhy do you say that?\u201d", "1553717733000": "\u201cIs she...?\u201d Coking her head to one side, Naoki remembers having heard the name once before. \u201cIsn\u2019t that... Rudiger\u2019s friend? Who sat to his left at The Summit, and said that she spoke on behalf of \u2018Edan?\u2019\u201d Naoki noticed something about her at the time but wasn\u2019t quite sure what. She didn\u2019t follow up on account of there being more pressing matters, but now it seems like Koitika has some level of familiarity.\u201cIs she a\u2026 'friend' of yous?\u201d Naoki probes, glancing sidelong at the demon on her shoulder.", "1553914868000": "Naoki smirks, having intended the humor. \u201c... Hmmh! Interesting.\u201d She had assumed that Koitika was of Lust\u2019s ilk, but evidently not. Putting a hand to her chin, Naoki hums in consideration. Miss Nofal\u00f3 has been disposed against the likes of Koitika; it would likely be for the best if she were not present for the meeting. More questions spring to mind about the political precedents and history of Edan, but if Naoki asks Koitika for that sort of information, she will have that information going into the meeting. It would be difficult not to betray that she does, and Deidra would get the sense that Naoki knows more than she should. And even though The Empress should be well-informed by spies and the like, knowledge of Edan\u2019s history and politics could only come from someone who was present. It would logically follow that Naoki must have associated with someone who had that sort of information \u2014 of which there are likely few. That would raise all manner of red flags were she in Miss Nofal\u00f3's position.But wait. \u201cDid she recognize you at the summit?\u201d", "1554088169000": "\u201cHmmh, I see.\u201d\u201cSeeing as how you\u2019re not associated with any group in Edan, it ought to be a harmless coincidence.

I\u2019m unsure where you\u2019re staying now, but...\u201d Naoki trails off, catching herself.\u201cBut, I digress. Let me then ask this question, returning to your initial offer: When you say \u2018me and my people,\u2019 do you mean... my entourage and I, visiting diplomatically? Do you mean... organizing voyages such that the people of Isra and the people of Edan can come and go as they like?\u201d Naoki makes a vague sort of questioning gesture. \u201cWhat do you have in mind\u2026 first?\u201d", "1558312234000": "\u201cOh, I know you don\u2019t need it,\u201d The Empress insists, waving away Deidra\u2019s objections. \u201cBut it\u2019s about respect\u2014you are a representative of your country, and it would reflect poorly on me not to see that you are comfortable during your time in Isra. It\u2019s common hospitality.\u201dListening to what Deidra says next, Naoki puts a hand to her chin. \u201cOn the one hand, yes, that makes sense, and if you believe it would be best, I will defer to your judgment and see about rustling up some ambassadors.\u201d\u201cHowever, on the other... Isra isn\u2019t as diverse as Edan\u2014not in the same way. Despite however we may try to frame it, Isra is a nation of predominantly mortals, existing only here, in the mortal realm. To be frank for just a moment: Edan\u2019s premise is ludicrous. The idea of having four realms bound as one, functioning as a single \u2014 albeit partitioned, government\u2026 It must be an administrative nightmare! I don\u2019t believe that such a thing could ever arise without the intervention of a higher power, and rather than trying to emulate Edan\u2019s diversity, I think it may be preferable to celebrate it for what it is: wholly unique, and to present Isra as what it is: a mortal realm as diverse as they come.\u201d\u201cTo that end,\u201d The Empress continues, gesturing with one finger, \u201cIt might make sense to emphasize the diversity Isra does have: as a nation of immigrants. If Edan is an ark that preserved humanity through The Cataclysm, now that the dust has settled, Isra is the remnants of humanity coming together with other, similar humanoids-\u201d Naoki waggles her ears, \u201c-to form a greater whole.\"\"One can only assume there exist parallel societies for the Sea, Skies, and Nether... but they\u2019re not here.\u201d Shrugging, The Empress gestures with one palm up and re-crosses her legs, very much at ease.", "1558421075000": "\u201cI do \u2014 there\u2019s no reason you should have to tromp alll the way out of the city and pay for lodgings when there are warm beds ready and waiting here in The Citadel.\u201d\u201cForemost among what Isra can offer Edan may be Trade. A great many types of goods pass through and are produced in Isra. I suspect the people of Edan will find these valuable for obvious reasons so it may make sense to bring a representative of The East Isran Trading Company, as well as a sampling of goods.\u201dHumming in contemplation, The Empress considers for a moment.\u201cWhat sorts of beasts do you have in Edan? Do you have griffins?\u201d", "1558725954000": "The Empress nods, expecting such a response. \u201cRegardless, perhaps a diplomatic gift of a few Dawn Riders would be well-received. Even though Edan may not need them for war, trained griffins are terribly useful creatures\u2014and a joy to ride.\"\u201cFurther,\u201d she continues, \u201cthere\u2019s the potential to exchange information. Isra and Edan both doubtless maintain extensive records, but the content of said records\u2026\u201d Trailing off, Naoki gestures in implication. \u201cI imagine quite different. There\u2019s some manner of exchange to be made there to be sure, but we don't need to figure out what it is right now.\"After considering for a moment, Naoki nods slowly. \u201c...I believe that\u2019s all for now.

We\u2019ll speak of this more then.\u201dNaoki then looks from Skarlet to Koitika, prompting them to make some manner of affirmation. A pledge to secrecy is, she thinks, implicit with the privilege of being in this room, but going through the formality is no trouble.  ", "1560217648000": "The Empress sits atop her throne, considering what else needs to be done. In a few days, she is to depart for Edan in what will be her first trip abroad in\u2026 a few years, certainly. And it\u2019s proving to be more difficult than she initially thought. The travel preparations themselves are all but complete - her bags are already on their way to the port. But preparing Isra for her departure is proving more problematic. The state is somewhat reliant on her \u2014 and understandably so, it was designed as such. Such a trip wouldn\u2019t have been possible a year ago, before the appointment of her Consuls, but the transfer of power isn\u2019t as simple as she might like it to be. That, and there are a good number of \u201cloose ends,\u201d so to speak. One such loose end ought to be arriving shortly, Naoki requested that Lady Venus come to speak with her not long ago.", "1560296926000": "Since learning of her skin-changing ability at their first meeting, Naoki has come to understand that Venus can appear as any given well dressed and somewhat slutty looking woman. For better or worse, there aren\u2019t terribly many of those strutting around The Citadel, and so when Venus enters, it\u2019s more or less what Naoki was expecting. The outfit doesn\u2019t show as much skin as usual, but an embellished jacket with pants so tight seems very much on-brand for Venus. Once Naoki sees Venus\u2019s eyes, however, she sees more than she was expecting - a glimmer of recognition where there should be none. The Empress scowls. This joke, stunt\u2014whatever it is, she finds in poor taste. Both women have their respective places in her life, and Venus is straying from hers. From hers, of which the full extent is hidden out of shame, and into Kate\u2019s, which is far, far away, deliberately separated from most everything else and protected by, among other things, literal walls and guards. Naoki unwittingly allowed Venus one glimpse of this treasured spot back at The Ball, and now here she is. Having replicated Kate\u2019s distinctive features, here she is, strutting all about as if she is Kate\u2014as if what she's doing is acceptable in any way. She\u2019s even going so far as to pop her damn hip.The Empress blinks. When Venus is still there, she blinks again. Her expression is frozen just as it was when the door was opened\u2014which is with no expression at all. For a long moment, The Empress just looks at Venus, standing there in her impudent heels.  The Empress does not express her anger outwardly, but a portion of it may be visible in her eyes as she stares at Venus. (It's a lot.)\u201cYou can come back tomorrow,\u201d The Empress states, enunciating with perfect clarity. In a lower voice, \u201cWearing something else.\u201d", "1560303729000": "The Empress raises her arm and snap-points at the door. She will have none of it.\u201cTomorrow,\u201d she reiterates, all but growling.Noting this, the guards lining each side of the room audibly shift in their armor, reminding everyone of their presence. It may not be a wise idea, but it is as they are trained to do.An irritated hand gesture waves them back. Naoki knows there\u2019s no sense in their attempting to escort Venus out, but she also knows that she\u2019s far too steamed to have any sort of coherent discussion.", "1560650507000": "The Empress remains exactly as she is until the doors close behind Venus, Once they do, she lowers her arm and begins to breathe deeply. With the subject out of sight, she\u2019s able to simmer down to a low boil\u2014a controllable level of anger. Grumbling and muttering expletives, she stares at the door through which Venus left. \u201cHow dare she.\u201d The room is dead silent. Venus said something there but The Empress did not hear. Perhaps she\u2019ll look at the transcript later, perhaps she won\u2019t. \u201cThere will be no more court today,\u201d declares The Empress, standing. \u201cSave the rest of those things for later,\u201d she instructs the listboy, \u201cAnd go.\u201dStalking out the side door, The Empress leaves, with the intention to go blow off steam.After a moment, the assembled guards and courtiers break formation, moving to stand and exit. There is a hushed tension about them. None of them quite understand what happened there, but The Empress was Upset. Rarely does The Empress get upset, and rarer still does she display anger.", "1560651629000": "The following day Naoki sits upon her throne once again. Legs crossed, hands folded in her lap, dressed in one of her favorite sweaterdresses, she is now prepared to speak to Venus.The anger of yesterday is not gone but has been tempered by time, food, and a few vigorous sessions with Koitika. She has considered her thoughts, sorted through them, and decided what she will do. One of the luxuries of being The Empress is being able to take that time, and she\u2019s better off for it. Any conversation yesterday would not have been a conversation at all.", "1560663811000": "\u201cHello, Venus.\u201d Naoki launches right into it. \u201cI apologize for being short with you yesterday.\u201d \u201cI initially wanted to speak to you regarding The Summit, but when you entered, looking like you did, I became exceptionally upset, to the point of unable to hold a discussion.\u201d\u201cSince then, I\u2019ve had time to settle and consolidate my thoughts, so now I will say this, and you will listen:\u201dA brief pause as Naoki searches her pouch. \u201cI have a unique relationship with Kate Green, the woman on the silver coin.\u201d Naoki holds up a silver coin for Venus to see before bringing it back into her palm to gaze at as she continues speaking. \u201cI love her very much, for reasons and in ways that are quite personal and very important to me. If you were previously unaware, now you are not.\u201d The coin goes back into the pouch.\u201cWhen you walked into this room yesterday looking like her, with her hair, her eyes, and so on, that upset me because you are not her. You are so very much not her, to such an extent I found it revolting and highly offensive. Not because it was itself ugly, but because it was a distorted, imperfect perversion of the original.\u201d\u201cNow, I am not asking you to understand any of what I\u2019ve just said. I am not asking you to understand the mortal concept of love or how I feel or why I feel the way that I do. What I am telling you is this: You are going to leave my personal life alone. You are going to leave Kate alone, not assume her likeness, or concern yourself with her in any way. You are not going to bring it up, talk about it, mention her in passing, imply things about it, gossip about it, or do anything at all remotely related to Kate or the relationship I share with her.\u201d Maintaining direct eye contact, Naoki counts these items off on her fingers as she lists them.\u201cYou will say, \u2018very well,\u2019 or \u2018as you wish,\u2019 or something to that end\u2014with a snarky remark if you\u2019d like, and then that will be the end of it, we\u2019ll move on to why I initially wanted to speak to you: The Summit, and we will not come back to this.\u201d Having reached the end of her prepared statement, Naoki gestures with finality. \u201c... I believe I\u2019ve expressed myself clearly but was any of that unclear to you? I want to avoid misunderstandings later.\u201d ", "1560826644000": "\u201cOh. Did you not?\u201d Naoki seems surprised; she assumed that if one had the power to shapeshift, that would be something to pay attention to and consciously control. For a moment she wonders what that must be like but now is not the time.\u201cWell then, in that case, there\u2019s no issue. Excellent.\u201d Naoki nods. Venus took that better than she thought she might.Turning her attention to the bag at her feet, Naoki looks from it to Venus and back. People don\u2019t tend to throw things at her. She makes no move to touch it and instead shoots Venus a questioning look. What is this?", "1561352048000": "Naoki blinks, one eyebrow higher than the other. The idea that Venus brought an apology gift without being prompted seems... suspect, to say the least. \u2018Prideful\u2019 is one of the big characteristics one would associate with demons. \u2018Generous\u2019, not so much.But then\u2026 what is it? What\u2019s in the bag? Conscious of the fact that this would be an excellent way for Venus to enact revenge, Naoki slides the bag a bit closer with her foot and leans to pick it up.Weighing it between her hands, Naoki considers the fact that it really wouldn\u2019t be in Venus\u2019s best health to try something fishy. The only reason she would be pure spite. And while Naoki is aware that they aren\u2019t the very closest of friends, she\u2019s done well by Venus so far and should like to think that this gift is in good faith. That\u2019s what Naoki thinks as she draws open the bag.", "1561589392000": "\u201cOh hoh, look at this!\u201d Pulling the bow from the bag, Naoki stands to examine it properly. There are lots of gemstones \u2014 it\u2019s a bit gaudy, but she supposes they all must serve some purpose. Aiming it off to one side, she gives the string a few experimental tugs. It seems very nice and certainly is very eye-catching in comparison to other bows she's used. Not needing to restring it will be excellent.After looking over it once more, Naoki sets the bow up against the side of her throne and turns her attention to the arrows. With the utmost care, she pulls one out and looks it over. After a brief investigation, Naoki concludes that it certainly is an arrow and she probably shouldn\u2019t fool with it. Placing it back into the bag, she ever-so-carefully ties the bag up and puts it on the floor next to the bow. \u201cThank you, Venus. We\u2019ll hope I never find myself in such a situation, but until then it will grace my mantle.\u201d Naoki almost motions for a page to come to take the items aside, but doesn\u2019t. She decides to go try it out after she's finished here.With that sorted, Naoki nods and moves to the next topic. \u201cNow then. ... I would like to follow up with you regarding The Summit.\u201dPressing her fingers together, Naoki pauses to give Venus a significant look. They both know what happened.\u201cWhat were your overall impressions? I\u2019d like to hear your thoughts on the event.\u201d", "1562034561000": "\u201cMmmh.\u201d Naoki murmurs pointedly in response to Venus\u2019s comments on the demons she deals with. That\u2019s not something she\u2019s going to get into right now.As for the summit not being productive, Naoki shrugs. \u201cIn some sense, yes. But I think it did what I intended it to: it made the metaphorical table of global politics into a literal table, with myself at the head.\u201d\u201cIt coaxed out leaders I would have never met otherwise and set the premise for our relationships going forward. It essentially created the political landscape in a manner that suits me. I didn\u2019t expect to hash out any huge treaties during the event \u2014 those can come later, if at all. The purpose was to make connections and extend my influence, and I\u2019m satisfied with its results in that regard.\u201d\u201cBut I wanted to follow up with you, though, regarding the matter that you brought up in front of everyone\u2026 Has anyone gotten back to you about that?\u201d A seemingly innocuous question that Naoki lends a significant weight to.", "1562208439000": "\u201cMmmmh!\u201d Naoki murmurs enthusiastically. \u201cExcellent!\u201d She\u2019s unsure how sarcastic she intends to be.

It wasn\u2019t disastrous, but if you wanted to pursue assistance from other nations in your fight, there are better ways we could have gone about that \u2014 you should have discussed it with me first. Really, I think your bit would have been better framed as assisting Isra against a common enemy, rather than your poor, desperate homeland begging for assistance from strangers. There would have been more support were it framed more favorably.\u201d Her hands in the air, Naoki shrugs. \u201cI\u2019m not going to throw a fit or demand that you beg forgiveness, but please don\u2019t do it again \u2014 not when it reflects on me on such a scale.\u201d That seems to be all Naoki has to say on the matter.", "1562358382000": "Naoki\u2019s mouth, a thin line, slides from one side of her face to the other, unamused.\u201cI appreciate that you were able to act maturely and conduct yourself with the minimum standard of decorum expected for the event,\u201d Naoki says. \u201cI don\u2019t mean to imply that you didn\u2019t \u2018behave,\u2019 or that doing so didn\u2019t require a great deal of effort on your part.

I\u2019m not even against the idea of you bringing it up \u2014 I just want to know beforehand so it could have been incorporated into my plan.\u201dGetting the impression that Venus is upset, Naoki raises her hands in a show of sincerity. \u201cReally,\u201d she says, \u201cI don\u2019t mean anything else by that.\u201d", "1563199635000": "\u201cMmmh.\u201d Naoki murmurs pointedly, not explicitly in agreement, but certainly not in disagreement.\u201cIt\u2019s something to work on,\u201d she supposes. \u201cBut you\u2019re not doing poorly.

In the present political climate, there are no foreign states she\u2019s particularly concerned with. \u201cFortunately, Isra doesn\u2019t lean very heavily on anyone else. We should certainly attempt to thwart him wherever he shows himself, but I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s important that you warn everyone.

You should probably schedule an appointment if you\u2019d like to see him, though; I haven\u2019t had much luck in just visiting his office.\u201d\u201cBut he\u2019s not... necessarily privy to all the same information Grandma or yourself are,\u201d she adds. \u201cBe sure to check with her before telling him anything in particular.\u201d", "1570998027000": "Empress Naoki sits languid in her throne, reviewing a set of notes given to her by the pageboy standing off to the side. Today, it seems, she is to be meeting with the same Captain \"Johnnie\" O'Malley who sent that letter to her office not too long ago. It says here, that she and her crew arrived in Port Silverion earlier in the week and have now made their way to The Citadel, where they now wait to meet with her. There\u2019s a bit of information provided by a naval officer and the port authority about the captain and her ship \u2014 it\u2019s evidently rather impressive.Naoki looks the information over, nods to herself, and returns the notes to the pageboy. Sitting up to adopt a properly stately stature, she gestures: \u201cSend them in.\u201d", "1571454937000": "As The Captain swaggers in and starts complimenting her throne room, The Empress smirks, amused. Based on the letter she wasn\u2019t expecting Captain O'Malley to be a demure sort, per se, but it certainly does take a certain amount of spunk to make an entrance like that. Either a cause or a symptom of being in power, she supposes.Empress Naoki looks on quietly as Johnnie introduces her crew, and gives slight nods to each of them in turn. \u201cA pleasure to meet you all.\u201d\u201cThere are certainly less interesting ways I could spend an afternoon,\u201d she jests, \u201cBut I make a point of at least humoring those who make the journey to see me, so I\u2019ll hear whatever it is you have to say.\u201d A prompting gesture suggests that she should go ahead.", "1571530518000": "In response to The Captain\u2019s request to speak freely, Empress Naoki offers a half-shrug. What is she going to say, \u201cNo, you must use the formal mode of address in my court\u201d? Just speak.To the gifts, she nods. As the ruler, Naoki is very much in favor of the custom wherein visiting dignitaries bring gifts to rulers they visit. She doesn\u2019t want for such things, but a gift is a gift.The matter of the pirate, however, is a good bit more interesting. One of the reports she recently received from Port Silverion mentioned that some trade vessels were robbed and that they were taking action accordingly, but The Empress didn\u2019t give it any more thought than that. What The Captain here means to say is that the perpetrator was one of hers, and she is offering to extradite him and return the stolen cargo. An interesting play, Naoki supposes \u2014 and admittedly a new one as far as ways to curry favor with her go.\u201cIn that case,\u201d she replies, \u201cI hope that Mr. Rivers will appreciate my infinite mercy in taking him off your hands, and the marked dryness of his cell. Someone will come to pick him up and see to the cargo; thank you.\u201d", "1571596994000": "Accepting the map as it is offered, The Empress looks it over as Johnnie continues to speak. Eyes down, ears up, she splits her attention, nodding in acknowledgment. \u201cMoney, you say\u2026? \u2026 You know how I like money.\u201d It isn\u2019t immediately clear if The Empress is being disingenuous or not, but she absolutely is. It\u2019s been a long time since the promise of gold has swayed her to do a damn thing, and the fact that The Captain here is attempting to appeal to her in such a manner is almost endearing.\u201cIsra very much appreciates partners in trade,\" she begins, handing back the map, \"And the idea of sanctioning a new independent port for trade isn\u2019t at all disagreeable, but the particularities of your suggestion are enough to give me pause.\u201dAnd pause she does, for a long moment as she organizes her thoughts.\u201cWith it being understood that I\u2019ve never visited your Libertalia, the understanding I have so far is as thus: As the inheritor of your father\u2019s pirate kingdom, you\u2019re now making an effort to \u2018go legit\u2019 and transform the pirate den into a respectable free port by opening legal trade routes with states such as Isra. Which is commendable.\u201d\u201cI wholeheartedly approve, but it remains that your port is predicated on crime, does it not? When Isran traders come to buy and sell goods, who would they be buying and selling from? \u2018Former\u2019 pirates, ostensibly. What gold would they receive in exchange for their wares? Stolen gold, ostensibly. And what goods would they buy if not those stolen from some other trade vessel?\u201dThe questions aren\u2019t wholly rhetorical, but The Empress isn\u2019t finished speaking. \u201cI have no issue supporting what you\u2019re doing with Libertalia, but I don\u2019t believe opening trade in the manner you\u2019re suggesting will be quite as simple as one might like. How do you propose that this is framed to the public, and to the traders? Those I choose to associate with earn me enough heckling as it is; for me to announce \u2018Ah yes, now we will be opening bilateral trade with this infamous den of pirates\u2019 would not go over well. Not with those who have lost fortunes and family members on the high seas, and not nearly well enough to justify the nebulous benefits you describe. How do you suggest that such an arrangement is justified narratively?\"", "1571700196000": "The Empress shakes her head, \u201cThat\u2019s not what I\u2019m asking. I don\u2019t worry for the safety of my ships at all. Every vessel that flies The Empire\u2019s Sun (legally) sails under its protection \u2014 under my protection, and I take it very seriously. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I very much appreciate what you\u2019re doing, and I mean that sincerely. Your efforts prevent a lot of bloodshed and lost gold, and that\u2019s very valuable. So much so that I could be convinced to compensate you for the service \u2026 But trying to sell me on \u2018trade protection\u2019 is trying to sell me something I already have, not a reason why Isra should open trade relations with Libertalia.\u201d\u201cI have no doubt that The Imperial Navy can protect The Empire\u2019s trade routes because I built it for expressly that purpose. That\u2019s why there are so many warships growing barnacles down at the docks and why labor is so plentiful in Port Silverion: they\u2019re reserve sailors.\u201d\u201cYour efforts notwithstanding, if Isran ships start getting attacked, I will damn well go out there and protect them myself by commanding the full might of The Imperial Navy to hunt down and \u2018bring justice\u2019 to any so foolish as to believe it wise to fool with Empress Naoki\u2019s ships.\u201dThere is a momentary pause, during which the silence is especially loud.\u201cAnd,\u201d she adds, raising one finger. \u201cI would relish the opportunity; it\u2019s not often that I have the opportunity to go sailing.\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d she continues, \u201cThe issue is not that I fear for my ships. The assurance that they will not be robbed is the bare minimum expected of a sanctioned port. I appreciate the effort you\u2019re making and the assurance you\u2019re giving me \u2014 and I take you at your word for it. Your system seems robust and is very much required.\u201d \u201cBut when you say you\u2019d like to open trade relations, I assume you mean trade, as it is perpetrated by traders \u2014 merchants. The owners of ships who make a living buying goods in one place and selling them in another for profit. The well-to-do sorts who live in large houses, dress in fine silks, and often congregate in The Moonlight Eclipse. It\u2019s their moving of goods that allows producers in Isra to export their wares overseas, and it is they who bring exotic items from abroad to be sold in the markets.\u201d\u201cAnd, with no disrespect intended, they don\u2019t care how \u2018fun\u2019 Libertalia\u2019s port may or may not be. I might for the purposes of visiting, but they make their decisions on the basis of risk versus reward \u2014 on cold, hard gold. Most of the time, seeing as how they value their lives and their ship is the sum of their livelihood, they\u2019ll choose to take the safe routes that net them a tidy profit rather than risking it all for perhaps a larger payout. These aren\u2019t grizzled captains coming together to exchange the goods they\u2019ve appropriated, these are members of the gentry \u2014 soft, portly, and risk-averse.\u201d\u201cAnd why should they visit a port that that harbors criminals in the most literal sense? They would be standing shoulder-to-shoulder and interacting with the very same who practice piracy on the open sea. Perhaps not on them, perhaps not near the port, and perhaps not as a majority, but piracy all the same. Even if it is absolutely certain it will not be eaten, and even if it knows there are carrots there, how many rabbits do you think would venture into the wolf den?\u201d\u201cIf all I tell my people is that there is legitimate trade to be found in Libertalia, yes, a few will go. But then all goods that they may bring back are automatically of questionable legality because it\u2019s entirely possible that those goods, perhaps though the hands of a middleman, were once owned by a trader just the same as themselves. If you\u2019re only enforcing the most basic laws of decency, follow logically that Libertalia is the premier location for pirates to offload goods under the pretense of 'legality', because it's not illegal if no law exists to make it so.\u201d \u201cNot only that, but you can best your last silver that Isran traders will return with illegal goods hidden in among the lumber and minerals. Visiting under the pretense of legitimate trade will enable the more mischievous merchants to import huge quantities of whatever they can buy in Libertalia, completely compromising all of my import restrictions and supplying the blackmarkets of Isra as they never have before.\u201dEmpress Naoki shrugs. \u201cI\u2019d like to work with you, and I may very well take you up on that offer to visit, but based on what you\u2019ve told me so far, I truly don\u2019t see why opening for trade with Libertalia would be a good idea for Isra. There exists the potential for a few people to make a lot of money, yes, but the decision-making apparatus of The Isran Empire has successful businesses of her own and sees no justifiable reason to support yours.\u201dAgain, The Empress shrugs, palms up. There\u2019s no malevolent intent, but The Captain said she was in favor of speaking plainly.", "1572024657000": "Listening, Empress Naoki nods not so much in agreement, but approval. By saying what she did in the way she did, Naoki meant to see how The Captain would respond, and the answer is seemingly to her liking. Captain O\u2019Malley did not take rejection or criticism poorly, and she did not bristle at Naoki\u2019s half-implicit threat. She responds with an appropriate, well-reasoned acknowledgment and doesn\u2019t try to force the issue. Captains are not expected to be skilled in such a manner; this must be the penchant for diplomacy that got O'Malley as far as this and is now carrying her further with the approval of The Empress.\u201cThe core of the issue with open trade is that it would make transport between Isra and Libertalia very very easy where it currently is not, and the problem with that is that you don\u2019t enforce the rule of law.\u201d\u201cBy your own profession, Libertalia a place for people (criminals) to start a new life, regardless of what they\u2019ve done in the past. It\u2019s a refuge, where anyone can walk the street without fear of prosecution, because liberty and freedom and all of that. The fact that you\u2019re legitimizing the place and turning the focus away from crime is good, but you\u2019re not changing the premise upon which order in its society is based.\u201d\u201cThe people of Isra don\u2019t commit crimes because they know that the law will be upheld throughout the land and all who commit crimes are justly punished for it. Crime still happens, but by taking away the reasons to and giving very good reasons why not to, the overwhelming majority never even consider crime in the first place, and order is achieved. If an assassin were to kill someone here in Isra, Isra would disseminate wanted posters and the assassin wouldn\u2019t be able to show their face anywhere. The people do not want a killer running around, but they do want the reward money. Sending wanted posters to Libertalia is a waste of time, because you do not enforce the rule of law and the people of Libertalia have no issue with having a killer in their midst \u2014 because many of them may very well be criminals of some sort themselves.\u201d\u201cIf I endorse Libertalia and make it easy to get there, I would be endorsing a refuge to escape my own law \u2014 easily, without suspicion, for the low low price of passage on a merchant\u2019s ship. An assassin could ply their trade at night and catch a ship out the following morning, escaping as soon as the ship sets off. Smuggling is similar, just the inverse: it would be a way to bring goods into Isra easily and without suspicion. I could check each and every crate, but some would slip through the cracks regardless, and the officials checking are susceptible to bribes.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s in our mutual interest to maintain good relations \u2014 you\u2019re a good person to know, and I\u2019m glad you\u2019ve come. Though I would like to support your goal of legitimacy and rehabilitation,exposing my nation to yours in open trade would be to expose my nation to a criminal refuge, and I\u2019m not willing to do that.\u201d\u201cHowever,\u201d Empress Naoki adds, raising one finger, \u201cIsra will purchase goods produced in Libertalia. The Empire needs about as many raw resources as you might expect, so I would be happy to source some from Libertalia \u2014 wood, stone, and whatever else, by the ton, with your seal. We can work out rates and conduct the exchange through official channels, as not to risk anything untoward.\u201d", "1572217141000": "Empress Naoki nods in response; it is very benevolent of her, and she appreciates the thanks. She makes a mental note to have Robert see to the importing; quantities of material are his domain.\u201cPart of my expectation,\u201d Empress Naoki adds, \u201cJust so that we\u2019re on the same page, is that in the event that a miscreant of particular note to me attempts to hide behind you on Libertalia, you and I will be able to sort things out between ourselves such that there's no fuss and I won\u2019t need to step on your toes to get to them.\u201dOne, two beats.\u201cWe need not speak of that further \u2014 indeed, we probably shouldn\u2019t, but I\u2019m saying as much explicitly here at the outset so that it won\u2019t come as a surprise if it ever does.\u201dMoving right along, \u201cAnd I will release a decree of endorsement recognizing Libertalia as a fledgling state with you as its leader. A state that is on good terms with Isra and with whom Isra will be conducting limited trade. Making note of the distinction between the state and its people, and relating your assurance that Isran ships are safe in Libertalia\u2019s waters.\u201d One ear tilts to the side as The Empress considers if there\u2019s anything else.

Flirting is fine, making implications is fine, even suggesting they go somewhere with a bit more privacy right there and right then \u2014 that would be within the bounds of what Naoki thinks to be acceptable. Quite forward, but acceptable. She\u2019d be a hypocrite otherwise. But for Captain O\u2019Malley to offer to spread her legs and those of her associate as payment \u2014 that crosses the line. That\u2019s the point where it stops being the licentious whims of The Empress and starts being an economy of sexual favors in name as well as practice, where she is thought to give and receive on the basis of reward and payment rather than simply doing whoever she wants. That\u2019s the line where The Empress becomes just as hedonistically corrupt as she's made out to be and the point past which any remaining pretenses of respectability are lost. Which \u2014 being faced by Johnnie and her lieutenant \u2014 is not necessarily to say that Naoki objects to the offer, per se \u2014 but to be so flagrantly candid as that is too far, even for her.Of course, The Empress says none of this and is not so transparent as to be read in such a manner. Rather, she raises a single eyebrow in tentative interest, mildly offended but not enough to say anything aloud.\u201cI\u2019ll see what information I can gather,\u201d Empress Naoki supposes, looking between the two of them. \u201cAnd we\u2019ll go from there.\u201dAs a closing note on the topic at hand, \u201cIt was likely an old traveler\u2019s log; ideally, there will be some actionable information to be found either in their notes or the course of their journey.

There are a fair number of loonies who play that card in an attempt to gain an audience her but if she\u2019s hearing about it, that means her staff has reason to suspect that this one is legitimate. Seeing as how she prides herself on being The Smart King, it would reflect poorly to die to something that was foretold but ignored.\u201cSend them in!\u201d she declares, inserting her bookmark and setting the tome aside. \u201cI\u2019ll speak to them.\u201d", "1580104191000": "The Empress watches her visitor enter and blinks when they collapse to the floor.

One of the Sentinels shouts, but the blue woman teleports forward and is reaching toward her \u2014 !The Imperial Sentinels do their job, moving swiftly from The Empress\u2019s side to just freaking clock the blue woman with the flats of their weapons and slam her ass down to the ground.

Other Sentinels lining the walls move to assist, but there\u2019s nothing more to be done. The Empress, for her part, is stunned. It takes her a moment to process what just happened and what happened as it was happening. She\u2019s disoriented for a moment, but recovers and stands. Sentinels move to stand between her and the assassin, and she leans on one as she recovers her balance. She mutters an expletive. It\u2019s very easy to see why rulers start to send away these oracle types. But was there something to that? Naoki glances to the assassin as they\u2019re carried away to the dungeon. There was substance to those words, but was any of it true? Will it be? \u201cGrief, Misery, and Pain\u2026\u201d Even as she reviews the words in her head they begin to fade.

It\u2019s been some time since Naoki has heard tell of The Black Vale. In the earlier years of her rule, the state was known to be quite insular, of a decidedly isolationist bent. Which is entirley understandable considering its relation with the undead. She has had the unique pleasure of meeting its leader on a few occasions, but they generally tend to remain at home, as she understands. (And Naoki is not one to visit.)If she remembers correctly, Ulfang led an attack against Goraia, back in the earlier portion of its reign, before Isra involved itself. And she remembers well how Ulfang came to assist Isra and The Tillers against that corruption business down in the eastern forest. It was with his aid and expertise that The Enclave were able to contain it in the quarantine zone, where it still exists to this day -- a lingering problem that would be too costly to fully eradicate.He left on good terms then, and Naoki hasn\u2019t heard a peep about him or his nation since. His visit is very much a surprise and it makes her wonder: What\u2019s going on? This is surely not a social call, why does he feel the need to visit?Considering that her last guest was an oracle who foretold Isra\u2019s doom, this does not bode well for Naoki whatsoever.

As infrequent as their meetings have been, they\u2019ve always been amicable, and amicable meetings are her area of expertise.

If your aim was truly to avoid aggression, you could have easily just kept your head down.

And as so long as they are protected by that immunity, they are forbidden from practicing magic of any sort, which includes manipulation of undead. \u2026 There is strong anti-undead sentiment within Isra that I have little ability to stifle. Ratifying friendship and granting The Black Vale an embassy will be an unpopular move in and of itself that will be tacked on to their list of my perceived transgressions and never forgiven. I am not beholden to the whims of my people, but if Isran citizens see your diplomats flaunting local law and practicing magic they themselves are forbidden to use, that will only exacerbate issues for us both.

I can\u2019t speak to the specifics of those, but The Black Vale will augment rather than immediately supplant whatever it is The Enclave is doing over there. You should speak to Daedalus about that.\u201d\u201cAnd,\u201d she adds, \u201cBlack Vale troop movements within Isran territory -- as they relate to quarantine but also in general -- must be planned in advance and cleared with the offices of the Imperial Army. That will probably be the responsibility of your emissaries.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll write all that down,\u201d she supposes, calling for a page to bring her writing materials. \u201cDo you find all that acceptable?\u201d", "1580451255000": "Once she receives the paper Empress Naoki sets about writing down those amendments, with her ears pointed at Ulfang as he speaks.

That much is non-negotiable, but isn\u2019t relevant to your raw goods. It applies mostly to dark magic and necromancy materials, which I will not allow you to sell to my people.\u201d Empress Naoki draws this line physically in the air with her quill.\u201cHowever, I will reimburse in full Imperial tariffs on raw bulk good imports sold by your merchants, up to the limit. The limits are quite high, but if you do manage to hit any of them I will either make a special provision to raise it or purchase the goods on behalf of The Empire at an equitable rate, such that you will be able to sell as much as you can produce. We should have those rates worked out in advance, but doing things in such a manner will avoid a situation wherein independent merchants falsely claim to be yours in order to take advantage of exemptions.\u201d\u201cI think that addresses both of our concerns and would be feasible to implement. There\u2019s no framework or precedent for granting exceptions to Imperial tariffs, merchants usually include them in their prices. Exemptions would involve issuing a decree, granting licenses to your merchants, making changes to tax filing\u2026\u201d Trailing off, Naoki waves a hand dismissively. \u201cBetter to keep track and reimburse periodically.\u201dPending a nod from Ulfang, Empress Naoki is prepared to commit that amendment to paper.", "1580459930000": "\u201cMmm, yes, though I will be signing in ink.\u201dAt the bottom of the amendments sheet, out of concern for Ulfang\u2019s health, Naoki adds a line to the extent that with the consent of both signatories, the agreement can be cancelled at any time with no repercussions.\u201cTimothy, come witness this.\u201d Gesturing, The Empress calls over a pageboy.Then, in full view of all assembled, Empress Naoki of The Isran Empire signs both documents, with a little note on each referencing the other. Her swanfeather quill and black ink are not particularly flashy in and of themselves, but she spends an extra moment on each to draw a little stylized Isran Sun seal with her ears on, which are very cute.She then hands both documents to little Timothy, who in turn offers them to Ulfang. ", "1580530185000": "\u201cI do find painful death somewhat distasteful, yes,\u201d she agrees, looking on as Ulfang seals his end of the contact.It\u2019s more than she would ever ask for such a relatively inconsequential document, but his entire kingdom is on the line, isn\u2019t it? This will leave a significant mark on his kingdom\u2019s history books \u2014 for the better. Reconciling with herself how lopsided most of her interactions and daily dealings tend to be is something she often does and will flex for lack of something better.\u201cI will have copies made and delivered to you before you leave the city,\u201d she says, gesturing toward Timothy and giving him a significant look. He will have copies made and delivered before King von Haren leaves the city.Timothy understands this and nods to excuse himself, glad to be out of that situation. The Empress turns back to Ulfang. \u201cVery good. Is there anything else you\u2019d like to discuss?\u201d ", "1580533037000": "The Empress is silent for a long moment. One of the guards swallows. \u201c...Very well,\u201d she supposes, \u201cI will speak to you.\u201dRising from her throne, Empress Naoki gestures to one of the remaining attendants: Visitation is over. Any who wish to meet with her will have to return tomorrow. They nod and scuttle off.Stepping down from the dais, The Empress walks past Ulfang and gestures for him to follow. \u201cCome.\u201d[Exit to The Empress's Chambers]", "1580710196000": "\u201cYour Highness, Lady Faisine of The Usque is here to see you.\u201d Sitting idle in her throne, Empress Naoki\u2019s eyebrows furrow. \u201cIs she really.\u201d The question is rhetorical and the page boy does not answer. (The Empress has been asking many rhetorical questions as of late and he was instructed never to reply.)\u201cVery well,\u201d Empress Naoki supposes, having no real reason to turn Faisine away. \u201cSend her in.\u201d", "1580787942000": "\u201cLady Faisine.\u201d The Empress states her name.\u201cIt is good to see that you are doing well, I hope.\u201d The remark is vaguely pointed, considering the circumstances of their last meeting, but The Empress doesn\u2019t harbor any particular ill-will toward the other woman and doesn\u2019t add any to her inflection where it is not warranted.\u201cWhat is it that I can do for the people of the Usque today? I am curious to know.\u201d ", "1580955995000": "\u201cTrees being cut down, hm?\u201d The Empress hums in consideration. \u201cIt must be quite the issue if it has come this far.\u201d\u201cIn the short term, I will issue a missive that forbids logging in the arbitrary vicinity of the holder\u2019s choosing. You will be the holder. You will deliver the missive to whatever lumber company it may be, and they will immediately cease logging by command of The Empress.\u201dGesturing to a page boy, The Empress calls for writing materials and upon receiving them, begins drafting said missive.\u201cOnce you\u2019ve done that, return to Isra and seek out Minister Robert Fletcher. With him, work to identify and solidify topographical borders for the area that ought to be protected, and I will then issue an Imperial Decree forbidding logging within the designated area.\u201d\u201cI believe that will solve our issue rather handily, as so long as The Usque does not move.\u201d It\u2019s difficult to tell if The Empress is saying as much in jest or if she actually suspects that the forest might move. Regardless, she looks to Faisine for her reaction.", "1581048934000": "\u201cYes, you will sort all of that out with the tribes and get it down onto a map with Robert\u2026\u201d The Empress continues writing, in a somewhat-slow but elegant script.\u201cThere are plenty of forests that are not \u2018inhabited\u2019 in quite the same way The Usque is. I was unaware that logging operations had extended so far as that -- as to intrude on The Usque, and it is regrettable that such conflict has transpired at all. One would think that if the forest starts fighting back, the enterprising lumberjacks would move their logging operation elsewhere, but I suppose some people just have to be told\u2026\u201dThe Empress reads over what she\u2019s written so far. Finding it to her liking, she reads aloud, \u201cTo the loggers\u2026\u201d\u201cUpon my order, cease logging in this area at once. The Usque Forest and all those that reside within it are under Imperial Protection, and to continue logging in its vicinity is to act in defiance of my word. Comply with this order, and you may continue logging elsewhere -- no consequences shall be levied against you. Fail to comply, and you will be prosecuted accordingly.\u201d\u201cSigned\u2026\u201d Empress Naoki signs the letter in full view. She then hands it off to a page to be stamped with the Imperial Seal and rolled into a scroll. It will be given to Faisine before she leaves. \u201cThere we are. I will speak with Robert and tell him to expect you. It may take some time to properly sort out and implement the restrictions as law, but I believe it worth doing such that this problem does not arise again in a decade\u2019s time. Is there anything else? Will you be needing lodgings or transport?\u201d", "1581135565000": "Empress Naoki exhales sharply at the mention of Trogdor, seemingly amused.\u201cVery well,\u201d she replies, \u201cIf you would have it such.\u201d\u201cIf the loggers give you any trouble, return to me and I will see them sorted out. If you change your mind about transportation or decide to visit the city some other time, both offers will stand. I will insist upon providing you warm provisions from The Handmaiden\u2019s Basket, but then I will wish you safe and swift travels. \u2026 It seems as though you\u2019re in better hands this time.\u201dNaoki nods to the new muscly friend, who seems decidedly less weasely than the last man she saw Faisine with (though by no virtue of his own).Having made that minor dig, Empress Naoki then nods to them both in farewell. \u201cUntil we meet again.\u201d", "1586929769000": "\u201cA date?\u201d Setting aside the report she had been reading, Naoki repeats what Skarlet said.\u201cThat\u2019s a novel thought,\u201d she supposes, putting a hand to her chin to consider the notion. \u201cYou certainly could have as many dates as you\u2019d like,\u201d she agrees. \u201cSimply to step outside the gate and announce you\u2019re looking \u2014 the news would spread like wildfire, without any more effort than that. They\u2019d be lining up for you just as they did for me. \u201cTo my great surprise, I actually had some amount of luck with that approach. Spirited little fellow named Keph, comes around every so often. ... Buckets of fun, he is. But you\u2019ll have to find your own,\u201d Naoki warns Skarlet, brandishing a finger. \u201cYou could try an approach like that, though I\u2019m not suggesting it. It was an extended and a rather troublesome process if I\u2019m to be honest. It was all very impersonal, sorting through the applicants, which is exactly what I think such a search ought not to be.\u201d She shrugs slightly. \u201cIf you wanted,\u201d Naoki cautiously begins, \u201cWe could play up the political angle and see about getting some foreign princes in here for you. They would want to cut right to the chase, though, with talk of alliances and dowries. But we\u2019re above that sort of thing,\u201d Naoki says, dismissing the whole concept with a wave of her hand. \u201cNo, I think what may be best for you is to go back to what you\u2019ve tried before. The Starlight Dawn isn\u2019t the same \u2014 not at all, but it fulfills the same sort of role in society. There\u2019ll be strapping young adventurer-type lads there, and that\u2019s still the demographic you\u2019re after, yes?\u201d", "1588183016000": "Naoki nods. \u201cLet me know how it goes,\u201d she replies, \u201cGood luck, be careful!\u201d Given Skarlet\u2019s abilities and how well The Dawn is guarded, the odds of Skarlet running into trouble are incredibly low, but that isn\u2019t what Naoki means.Watching the doors close behind her, Naoki ruminates on how glad she is to have Skarlet and the strange set of events that led up to her adoption. Now that she\u2019s come into power, that Naoki no longer spends as much time with Skarlet seems almost too stereotypical of a problem to have, and fits in quite snugly along with the rest of Naoki\u2019s regrets.She sighs. \u2026 They ought to have tea or something sometime.", "1464995848000": "From behind one of the more opaque curtains, the curvaceous figure of Madame Naoki enters the room. For this occasion, she has chosen to wear her sheer, wrapping red dress. (Having cleaned it thoroughly since the last time it was used.) It trails behind her, across the carpet as she moves fully into the room with silent steps. Presently, she spots Eli, fiddling as he is with the curtain. For a moment, she simply watches, one eyebrow coked upward. What is he doing? Her tail twitches. An irritating proverb comes to mind. Instead of approaching, she continues moving into the room, and speaks. \u201cSir Eli. Greetings.\u201d She keeps her gaze trained in his direction, and attempts to discern what he\u2019s up to as she moves over to the sunken seating area, and begins to rearrange some of the pillows. ", "1465048084000": "Keeping one eye trained in Eli\u2019s direction, Naoki proceeds to finish her pillow arrangement, creating a stack to form a sort of makeshift chaise lounge chair. Seating herself, she lies on her side, resting her chin in one hand and draping her tail across the top of the chair.\u201cI see. Have a seat,\u201d she gestures to the opposite side of the seating area.\u201cAnd how are things proceeding over there? Any interesting developments? I trust you\u2019ve come with more than simply greetings.\u201d", "1465071787000": "As Eli takes his seat, Madame Naoki remains essentially motionless on her perch, studying the man as he moves. An interesting sort, she thinks. There\u2019s a story to that sword, that much is clear. Perhaps he\u2019s one of those \u2018retired\u2019 military sorts. She idly wonders how and why he worked his way into the employ of that little eccentric gnome, Victor. Eli could just have easily found a position within Isra\u2019s military or governmental structure. Or anywhere else, really. His archetype is a desirable one for many types of organizations. She listens as he delivers his update, and nods thoughtfully before responding. \u201cFair enough, fair enough. I don\u2019t have anything particular in mind for him to work on just now, aside from continuing to develop and fortify the castle. I\u2019d like it to be capable of functioning as a castle, with all of the defensive bells and whistles associated with that, if need be. If he needs any resources to make that happen, let me know.\u201dWhen presented with the gemstone, Naoki sits up, and carefully plucks it from the table with thumb and forefinger. Holding it up to one of the lights, she examines it as a skilled lapidary might, having a considerable amount of experience in gemstone appraisal by this point. \u201cYour sources heard correctly. There\u2019s something about them I enjoy. Perhaps it's the uniform transparency. Perhaps the way they\u2019re cut to be so smooth. Maybe the way they feel in my hand, or the extrinsic value placed on them for the other properties, even though they\u2019re usually quite useless. This one is a nice one. Emeralds are always are, really. Thank you.\u201dNaoki nods her head in thanks, and slides the gem into the pouch on her hip, clinking slightly as it joins its fellows. Afterward, she returns her gaze to Eli, to see what else he might have to say.", "1465101092000": "\u201cIs it.\u201dTaking the gem back out of her pouch with apparent ease, Naoki takes another moment to consider it. Not being gifted with any manner of magical ability or magesight, the gem looks exactly as it did. A small, square-cut emerald, rolling about in the palm of her hand. Enchanted with necromantic magic, apparently. Powerful stuff, too. Not even simply reanimating a corpse, but placing it under her control. She wonders as to the\u2026 realistically? The finesse? Sometimes necromancy results in shambling zombies. Other times, when a high degree of skill is employed, the dead are indistinguishable from the living. What degree of necromancy would this gem result in, is the question. One that might not ever be answered, she supposes. As interesting a thing as this is, she can\u2019t quite see a use case for it. But, she supposes. It will be quite useful if such a situation ever does arise that would necessitate its use. So whatever. Handy. Nodding slightly, she returns it to the pouch. \u201cI see. I appreciate it, though I don\u2019t have any immediate plans for its use. Forward my thanks to Victor.\u201dNaoki turns her appraising glance next onto the man sitting opposite her. Just like the gems, he seems to be a multifaceted sort. Perhaps some inquiry into the man himself would be\u2026 rewarding. \u201cHow about you, though? You strike me as an interesting sort. How did you get involved with Dr. Frankeneblin?\u201d", "1465256586000": "Both pointed ears remain trained in Eli\u2019s direction as he relates his story. And an interesting one, it is. Sir Eli here must have some manner unique talent or skill, to have been selected in that way. Perhaps he\u2019d elaborate, or perhaps she could rub the information out of Victor, next time she sees him. \u201cWhat\u2019s it like, working for him? I can\u2019t imagine it\u2019s the most\u2026 pleasureable work. It must be rather stressful, working with such hideous things each day. Do you ever wish you worked in a more comfortable profession?\u201dShe punctuates this sentence by stretching out luxuriously across her side of the couch, extending her arms upward to reach as far as they can toward one end while pointing the tips of her feet down in the opposite direction. Though the movement itself is nothing is not casual, it has the almost certainly intended side effect of displaying the fullness of her figure. Each curve illustrated and outlined by the tightly fitting dress, the topmost portions of which threaten to rip, very nearly lacking the tensile strength to contain her two most prominent assets. Yet, she still looks to Eli with a politely inquisitive look. Still evidently interested to hear his answer. ", "1465413532000": "At Eli\u2019s mention of \u2018putting the bodies to use\u2019, Naoki\u2019s brow wrinkles almost imperceptibly; a small motion that doesn\u2019t even begin to reflect the intensity of her disgust. Way to kill the mood. Goodness knows she has her own fair share of kinks, but that is not one of them. Defeats the purpose. Worse than acting alone, even. All\u2026 cold and such. An affront to the very concept. Nodding slowly, she straightens; sitting up, and folding her hands in her lap. \u201cI see.\u201d Her tone has dropped all pretense of subtext. Simply speaking the words without any emotion to them.She continues to nod slightly, training a judgmental gaze in his direction. For a moment, she simply sits. Thinking. Considering.But no. There are standards, hidden somewhere between those two pointed ears of hers, believe it or not. And this man does not meet them. Sometimes desperate times call for desperate measures, perhaps, but now that she knows where he\u2019s been, there\u2019s not a part of him that\u2019s appealing. (Which is to speak nothing of the mental image. Massive turn-off.)\u201cWell. You should consider spending some time here in Isra to relax. Just outside the Citadel, there\u2019s a little place. The Moonlight Eclipse. I own the place, actually. And I\u2019ve seen to it that it\u2019s the finest establishment in Isra, and quite possibly the world. My suggestion is, once we\u2019ve wrapped up here, to head over there and spent a couple hours relaxing before returning to Frankelblin\u2019s castle. They\u2019ve got fine dining, music, women, all of that. I think you\u2019d enjoy yourself. Here\u2026\u201dTurning to one side for a moment, in a funny sort of hand movement, Naoki produces a coin. A Midnight Sun Eclipse. Evidently, sleight of hand is something she has been practicing. In a much less practiced motion, she sets the coin rolling on its side across the table. Upon reaching Eli\u2019s sword, it topples, falling on its side with a soft metallic noise. \u201cMy gift to you. Now. Is there anything else you\u2019d like to address, or?...\u201d She trails off, unsure if he has anything else. If not, this hasn't quite been the most productive meeting.\u00a0", "1465464408000": "\u201cOh, is it not.\u201d What she\u2019s referring to isn\u2019t clarified. \u201cFair enough, then. I misunderstood your previous statement. I don\u2019t have any strong feelings about what he\u2019s doing over there with the corpses, then.\u201d Moving to the next topic, she leans over the table some, placing her elbows on her knees to get a better look at the sword, though she does not reach for it. \u201cI do have a child. An adopted child, but a child nonetheless. Skarlet. Though a strange and unfortunate series of events, she was subjected to a severe form of amnesia roughly two years ago. It\u2019s somewhat strange, because she, as a person, is only that old. Only two. She only has two years worth of memories and knowledge. Yet, her body, and skills of language and motor control, are more in line with a woman of twenty. She\u2019s taller than I am. Only by about an inch, and not counting my ears, but if you were to place us side by side, one would not guess that one was the parental figure of the other. It\u2019s somewhat strange. Definitely abnormal, but I love her all the same. She is still definitely a child, and I will continue to support her in a parental capacity for as long as I\u2019m able to.\u201dA short pause as Naoki completes that thought and moves to the next, \u201cI will give Liz the sword in your stead. How would you like me to present it to her? Would you like me to allude to your existence, or?...\u201d She trails off, unsure. This conversation has taken a number of dips and dives, and she hasn\u2019t quite caught up, or decided on what sort of note she intends to end the meeting.", "1465628503000": "\u201cWell. For what it\u2019s worth, it may calm you some to know that Liz is doing quite well. I met her\u2026 a handful of years ago at this point, purely by chance. She was working hard in one of Isra\u2019s traditional legions. Doing about as well as she could have been, so low on the totem pole. I spoke with her a bit, and took a chance. Sponsored her. Sent her to officer training, and she took well to it. Was a Lieutenant for a while, and I recently promoted her to her current position as General.\u201dStaring out one of the windows behind Eli, Naoki reflects for a moment before continuing. \u201cShe\u2019s bit audacious at times. A bit stubborn at times. But her heart is in the right place, and she does good work. For me, and for her city. Very trustworthy, she can be relied upon for important work. You can take some small measure of pride in that, I think. \u2026 I do. \u2026 Is there anything I should tell her about the sword? Usage instructions, history, any of that?\u201d ", "1465801129000": "Madame Naoki nods slowly. This isn\u2019t quite what she was expecting out of this meeting. Readjusting herself in her seat, Madame Naoki crosses one ankle over the other and re-fixes her gaze on the man sitting opposite her.\u201cIt\u2019s been my pleasure. I\u2019ll be sure to relate this information to Elizabeth when she returns.\u201dStanding from the couch, Madame Naoki takes a moment to stretch her back before stepping partway around the table and extending her hand to Eli. When she speaks, the only inflection in her words is one of sincerity. \u201cIt has been a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Sir Finch. You\u2019ve heard my instructions and suggestions, so I\u2019ll not repeat them, but I have just one more. \u2026 Visit again sometime. I\u2019ve not the time to converse at length now, but you seem like an interesting sort of man who might have a lot to say. I\u2019d like to know you better, and next time you come, who knows. You might have a daughter waiting for you.\u201d", "1466179985000": "In one of the tall windows of the Hospitality Den, Madame Naoki stands, mug cupped in one hand. From her perch here, though she can\u2019t quite see above the Citadel walls, a clear view is afforded of the Citadel Gate. As she watches, the bulk of the Dawn Riders return, some leading their griffins, others choosing to ride. Regardless, the majority of them trudge off toward the combination barracks and eyries. Returning home after a job well done. Fewer in number, but ultimately triumphant. That\u2019s sort of the thing about war, she muses, sipping at her drink. Never are battles won without loss of life on the winning side. Each victory is bitter-sweet. Which isn\u2019t\u2026 really\u2026 excellent, she supposes, but it\u2019s also war, and such is the reality of things. Regardless, turning back about and passing back through the veil of layered curtains, Naoki is careful not to fold the hem of her short modal robe as she seats herself in the seating area. Still sipping at her mug, reviews her preparations and mental notes. This meeting- there will be a number of things to cover. A few moments now, while she has the time, should allow her to expedite the\u2026 boring bits quite a lot.", "1466253196000": "\u201cLiz!\u201dPlacing her mug down on the table and rising from her seat, a few quick steps bring Naoki within arm\u2019s reach of Liz. Judging by her outstretched arms, it seems almost as if Naoki is going to go for the hug, but at the last moment, her arms lower, instead opting for the handshake-shoulder clap combo.\u201cWelcome back, it\u2019s good to see you. Have a seat, we\u2019ve got a lot to discuss.\u201dGesturing inward to the sunken seating area, Naoki leads the way over and reseats herself, expecting Liz to choose a position somewhere around the circumference of the sofa. \u201cFirst and foremost, allow me to repeat, welcome back; and congratulations on your victory. Through your leadership and personal involvement, a situation that could have potentially developed into an international disaster of hitherto unforeseen chaos and loss of life. For this, you have not only my personal thanks, not only the thanks of the people of Isra, but the thanks of the civilized world at large. I\u2019m not sure how aware you are of the gravity of the situation you were involved in there, but you will be remembered as a hero for this, alongside the others that took part.\u201d\u201cFor your actions, you, St. George, and your company have all earned all manner of medals and commendations. There will be an awards ceremony sometime next week. Is there anything further I should be aware of that you haven\u2019t had the opportunity to share yet?\u201d", "1466346709000": "As Liz produces the crystal shards, Naoki nods slowly, and begins to articulate her thoughts, \u201cI was actually informed of the queen\u2019s intentions earlier, by one of my other pieces on the field. Preparations have already begun. These crystal bits you\u2019ve confiscated... I think I\u2019ll hand them over to The The Enclave of Isranian Magi   for analysis. Any information we can garner is good information, I would think.\u201dTurning her head to face Liz, Naoki\u2019s volume rises above the somewhat disinterested tone of her last statement, \u201cThat reminds, me, though; we\u2019ve gone and redone the government, Liz! Get comfortable for this...\u201dBending her knees up to bring her bare feet up onto the surface of the couch, Naoki rests her left arm across the top of her knees and gesticulates with her right hand (still holding the mug) as she continues emphatically.\u00a0\u201cSo, the first thing is that Former Prime Minister Sephiran is just that- former. A vote of no confidence was called by Judiciary Governor Ryden. The vote and the discussion preceding it were politics at their finest, but the vote ended up passing.  Ryden was chosen to fill the position, and in cooperation with myself, a wave of governmental reforms were ushered in.\u201dIt\u2019s a good thing Liz isn\u2019t sitting on the opposite side of the table following Naoki's change in posture; she might feel rather uncomfortable if she were.\u201cChiefly, there\u2019s a new body. The Conclave. Sitting above The Assembly, The Conclave is intended to be a gathering of the individuals who actually do things for the nation, as opposed to simply elected representatives of the people. The Conclave has the exclusive right to propose new bills, and The Assembly has the exclusive right to sign them into law. Conclave members are chosen from the Assembly, but appointment to is up to my decision, and I can also veto bills at any stage of the process. There will be Ministers on The Conclave for each major area of the government's concern. Finances, Industry, Immigration, all of those sorts of things. Each of them will be responsible for their own bivouac of responsibilities, and there will be representatives for each of the three branches of military.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve gone ahead and cut a few deals, and we have an Isran navy in the works. They\u2019ll operate out of the river, and I\u2019m inclined to think that I\u2019ve found some highly talented individuals to run it. The third prong, though, will be your Dawn Riders. Land, sea, and air, I figure. I\u2019ve budgeted more funds into your organization, issued orders to prepare for expansion, and split the whole thing off from the primary army. You\u2019ve been promoted, too, High Commodore Elizabeth Finch. You stand on equal footing with High General Cyronin and High Admiral Valerian. Congratulations.\u201dWith a chuckle and accompanying smirk, Naoki\u2019s mug-less hand detaches from her knees to aim a friendly sort of shove in Liz\u2019 direction.", "1466469249000": "As Liz scoots in to go for the hug, Naoki is caught somewhat off guard, but does not protest. She can work with this. Reaching off to one side, her mug finds an unstable resting place atop a nearby pillow, allowing both of Naoki\u2019s arms to reciprocate the embrace, wrapping themselves around Liz\u2019 torso. One arm comes to rest on Liz\u2019s lower back just above the curve of her rear, slightly lower than typical propriety would indicate, but quite within the bounds of accidental placement. Like this, Naoki remains, for however long Liz decides to maintain the embrace. Always ideal to allow the other to disengage, after all. However, once she does, Naoki takes just a moment to transfer the mug from its temporary perch atop the pillow over to the level surface of the table. Only a few dregs of her beverage remain anyway. With the mug safely tucked away, and some progress in the intimacy department logged,  Naoki decides that some more closeness is in order.  Besides, she\u2019s a bit cold in the robe. Barring any quick scooting away or rejection on Liz\u2019 part, Naoki aims to rest her head against the front of Liz\u2019 shoulder, in such a way that would leave one pointed ear just barely tickling Liz\u2019 cheek, and set the natural resting position of Liz\u2019s hand on her upper thigh. An unfortunate - or fortunate, as the case might happen to be - side effect of her motion is that the front of her robe gapes open just a little more than it was designed to. The view Liz is presented does not offer enough vantage for full exposure, but is quite enough to confirm that Naoki is not wearing anything under the robe.Resting the side of her head on Liz\u2019 chest, Naoki speaks softly,  \u201cYou\u2019ve done everything to earn my trust. You\u2019re reliable, responsible, and a good leader. Easily among my favorites, you are. But this promotion\u2026 it will come with more responsibilities. You\u2019ll be expected to attend Conclave meetings, manage more men, and adopt a more administrative role across the board. More stress, really.\u201dAs she speaks, Liz may become aware of the way Naoki\u2019s whole body moves slightly with the tempo of her speech, and the manner in which vibrations are translated not only through the air between them, but directly from one body to the other. \u201cHow are you faring in that regard, by the way? Fighting tooth and nail to save the world must take a lot out of a girl. You are getting enough time to relax between duties, aren\u2019t you?\u201d", "1466615041000": "\u201cAh, but you\u2019ve got to draw the distinction. I don\u2019t mean the distinction between battlefield stress and administrative stress, but rather the distinction between the thrill of battle, finding enjoyment in leadership, solving difficult problems, and the other kind of stress.\u201dAs she\u2019s speaking, Naoki\u2019s tail finds its way around and snakes its way up between Liz\u2019 legs, gently rubbing against the inside of her thigh.\u201cThe bad kind of stress, where you internalize everything and don\u2019t express yourself. Where you\u2019re constantly on edge. When you don\u2019t speak earnestly with anyone, don\u2019t relax, and never feel at peace with yourself. Look at yourself\u2026\u201dNaoki\u2019s head nuzzles back into Liz\u2019 shoulder, rolling from side to side in a massaging motion, causing her ears to flatten and rub up into Liz\u2019 cheek. \u201cYou\u2019re tense. Muscular, but tense. When was the last time you took a few hours just to yourself? When was the last time you were hugged, before just now? When was the last time you made love, or spent any length of quality time with someone bipedal? You\u2019ve been working almost nonstop for years, Liz. You\u2019ve killed more people than you\u2019ve kissed. You\u2019ve spent more time in the saddle than in bed. And don\u2019t misunderstand, I don\u2019t mean to imply that your contributions haven\u2019t been appreciated. You\u2019ve saved more lives than can be counted, and your dedication has seen you all the way up the ladder, and earned you every bit of glory and favor you have. Your nose has been at the grindstone for as long as I\u2019ve known you. ... But that\u2019s no way to live your life, even if you do find enjoyment in the hard work. Sometimes\u2026\u201dNaoki trails off, lost either in thought or the the other woman\u2019s not-quite-tender embrace. However, she raises her head abruptly, turning to face Liz, eager to articulate her latest thought, \u201cSometimes, one just needs a massage! Like you, right now. Let me work that muscular tension out of you. Roll over?\u201dWith one raised finger, Naoki makes a small swirling motion to accompany her suggestion. ", "1466642249000": "\u201cYour personal well-being is not to be so callously neglected, Liz. Mental stress leads to less than full control of yourself. That leads to mistakes. Mistakes on the battlefield lead to death. And that would be less than pleasant for the both of us. To speak nothing of physical stress.\u201dNaoki disengages herself and stands, allowing Liz to reposition. She takes a moment to stretch, raising her hands up above her head and arching her back and tail together to form what is very nearly a full circle. Releasing the pose after a few moments, she begins to crack her knuckles, turning back around to face the sofa. What she sees there inspires a jokingly irritated sort of look, accompanied by a small huff and one hand being placed on Naoki\u2019s hip in mock-disapproval.\u201cCome now, do you really think I\u2019m going to be able to massage your shoulders with those epaulets on? I\u2019m flattered by your confidence in me\u2026 but I\u2019m not that good. Off with your top! I\u2019m going to go get the oil.\u201dWith that, Naoki slinks her way away, bare feet making only the softest of pads across the floor, off behind some conglomeration of curtains, presumably in the direction of wherever the oil is kept. A moment passes in silence before an afterthought filters back through the curtains: \u201cAnd the trousers too!\u201d", "1466698041000": "Presently, Naoki returns to the main area of the Hospitality Den, a small wooden box held under one arm. Standing up on the main floor above the seating area, she takes a moment to look down upon Liz\u2019 prostrated form. Naoki\u2019s tongue runs itself across her upper lip in an almost predatory fashion as she savors the sight. However, why just look when one can touch. Setting the box down on the edge of the sofa, Naoki slowly eases herself down onto the sofa, placing one knee on either side of Liz\u2019 abdomen to straddle her from behind. Seeing as how the pair of them are almost the same size, Naoki\u2019s legs aren\u2019t quite long enough to prevent contact, and as such, the insides of her legs brush warmly up against Liz\u2019 sides, from the sides of her stomach all the way down to where Naoki\u2019s feet rest on either side of Liz\u2019 thighs. However, Liz need not endure the dampening presence of her undershirt much longer. Reaching a hand down between her own legs, Naoki grasps at the hem and begins tugging upward, intending to bring the undershirt up over Liz\u2019 head and remove it. \u201cAlmond oil leaves nasty stains, let\u2019s get this off you\u2026\u201dAssuming that she is allowed to, Naoki proceeds to gently remove Liz\u2019 undershirt and cast it aside unceremoniously to rest in a pile with the rest of her clothes. ", "1466718505000": "With that pesky bit of cloth out of the way, the full expanse of Liz\u2019 back is exposed. Naoki gently slides Liz\u2019 ponytail off to one side, as not to get in the way of the massaging. Reaching over to the side, a few bottles clink about in the box as Naoki locates the massage oil. Dripping a healthy amount onto one hand, she takes another tantalizing moment to rub the oil into and between her hands, warming up the oil, releasing the scent, and keeping Liz on edge for just a moment longer. Soon enough, however, Naoki sees it fit to begin. Spreading her hands, she plants the pads of her fingers on Liz\u2019 shoulderblades. She gives a few experimental kneading motions before pausing. \u201cTake three deep breaths...\u201dAs Liz breathes, Naoki breathes with her, and afterward, subtly adjusts her position to sit more comfortably. Then the massage begins in earnest. Naoki starts by placing the palms of her hands to either side of Liz\u2019 spine, and sweeps them outward, rubbing lightly up toward the shoulders before repeating, moving incrementally downward with each successive effleurage. As she nears the the lower portions of Liz\u2019 back, the tactic changes. Moving back up to the shoulders and using the palms of her hands and the surfaces of her fingertips, Naoki massages around the tops of Liz\u2019 shoulders, rolling around the sides of her neck, and up to the base of her skull. She maintains a slow, yet steady rhythm, syncing her movements to the pace of Liz\u2019 breathing. A few light squeezing motions are employed to loosen up the shoulders, before Naoki\u2019s hands slide their way back down Liz\u2019 spine in one fluid stroke. Spreading out her hands once again, Naoki starts at the base of Liz\u2019 spine and brings her hands up slowly, all the way up to the shoulder blades, and back down again, gliding across the skin. The oil removes the majority of the friction, but Naoki subtly increases the pressure with each consecutive stroke, using her hands to soothe the muscles in both sides of Liz\u2019 back simultaneously. The pressure is applied only in the upward direction, however; toward the heart.Presently, Naoki pauses, removing her hands and sitting up. The clinking of glass would suggest that she\u2019s applying more oil to her hands. She intones softly, her words matching the gentleness of her hands, \u201cHow are you feeling? Have I missed anything so far?\u201d", "1466784095000": "\u201cThen on to the lower back we go\u2026\u201dShimming downward, Naoki brings her area of focus to settle squarely on Liz\u2019 lower back and behind. Another predatory sort of grin crosses her face as she finishes rubbing the oil into her hands. To begin, she places her hands on the sides of Liz\u2019 waist, giving a few experimental rubs but really just testing the waters, feeling out the shape. Gradually, her hands slide down. Down to the hips, and even lower than that in rhythmic, curvilinear strokes, carrying Liz\u2019 underwear down with themWith the posterior presented, Naoki\u2019s hands stroke upward and toward the center, rendezvousing in the small of Liz\u2019 back before again going their separate ways downward. Using primarily the palms, Naoki makes long, fluid strokes down from the lower back to the buttocks, and back up again. Eventually, she transitions into kneading motions focusing on the bottom. Here, the flesh isn\u2019t quite as pliable as one might like. Some combination of muscular tension and tone. This elicits a soft sort of chuckle from Naoki. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of tension in here; your butt is saddle-shaped, Liz.\u201dNaoki begins to apply petrissage to remedy this. Forming an angle with one hand and her other thumb, she kneads the tissue, squeezing it, pressing it, and rolling it about beneath her hands. Each motion is very strictly centripetal, intending to aid the flow of blood up and out toward the heart. She debates utilizing tapotement to more thoroughly work the soreness out, but decides against it after glancing up to see Liz\u2019 facial expression. One of complete submission. Yet another carnivorous sort of smirk crosses Naoki\u2019s face, and she debates cutting the massage portion of their time together short, but again, decides against it. It isn\u2019t as if either of them have anywhere else to be. Instead, she shimmies downward once again, bringing her knees to a stop on either size of Liz\u2019 feet. Reaching upward, Naoki prefaces the third stage of her massage by finishing her removal of Liz\u2019 underwear, sliding them all the way down and off around her feet. They, too, are tossed off unceremoniously to sit with the rest. Then she begins. Starting with upward, flowing strokes starting at the ankle and going all the way up to the thigh and back down again, Naoki moves from the outer legs to the inner in tandem, bringing the tips of her fingers to brush tantalizingly against the erogenous zone between Liz\u2019 legs at the height of each motion. Each consecutive upward stroke is applied with more gentle pressure than the last, and the rhythmic motions seem unending.However, she does not dwell there. Leaving the honeypot untapped, Naoki moves all the way back down the legs, focusing her attention next on the feet. After taking another moment to re-oil her hands, Naoki addresses both feet simultaneously, switching from her palms to the pads of her fingers to make small circles of pressure just beneath the toes. Gradually, she slides upward, around the arch of the foot, up over the heels, and then addressing the ankles. After repeating these motions a few times, Naoki\u2019s hands begin to move once again up the legs, still maintaining that slow, steady rhythm. Then she begins the downward strokes. Starting at the inner thigh, Naoki\u2019s hands slide their way down all the way down to the soles of the feet before sliding their way back up. With each downward rub, the pressure increases slightly before easing off for the gentle upstroke. After a few repetitions, Naoki figures that Liz\u2019 legs are about finished. With a mildly pleased sort of grin on her face, Naoki moves back, disengaging herself to sit properly on her behind near Liz\u2019 feet. Reaching a hand over, she jostles Liz\u2019 behind with a playful shove- really more of a slap, and speaks, \u201cThat\u2019s it for your back. Roll over so I can do the front.\u201d", "1466815070000": "Naoki represses another predatory grin as Liz obediently turns over. What a sight that is. One that Naoki finds most appreciable. And, she supposes, one that her eyes are alone in having the pleasure of viewing- now, or at any other point, past or present. High Commodore Elizabeth Finch! The strong, the stubborn. Hero and decorated veteran of war, whose cunning and ferocity on the battlefield knows no peer. Whose skills, both martial and in command, played a significant role only days ago in what would have been otherwise another great cataclysm. Blushing wildly, absolutely submissive, totally naked, lying on her back, oiled up, and all but begging to be ravished. And, while Naoki\u2019s benevolence is often limitless, so too is her capacity to tease. Standing from the sofa, she sheds her robe, taking a few steps up toward the head of the seat. Moving back up again onto the sofa, Naoki kneels with her knees to either side of Liz\u2019 head. As she reapplies oil to her hands, Naoki looks down to make eye contact, flashing a cheerful smile that contrasts wildly with the tenderness of her motions as she sets in for the third stage of the massage. Sliding her hands around the upper chest, Naoki again appraises the area with experimental rubs and presses before beginning properly, starting with the shoulder well. Between thumb and forefinger, she applies pressure to the point in the middle of Liz\u2019 tendons in the base of her neck to release another node of tension. However, she dwells here for only a moment before moving on down around the shoulders to the clavicle. Pressing gently she spends a moment tenderly stroking at the erogenous zone just below Liz\u2019 collarbone before moving downward once again, sliding between Liz\u2019 breasts to pause upon finding the slight indentation just above her heart in the center of her chest. Here, in this intention, Naoki applies pressure with two fingers from each hand, draining the tension in Liz\u2019 chest up, into her warm hands, and away. For a handful of moments, the ceaseless ministrations pause as Naoki continues to apply pressure, simply breathing in pace with Liz. Presently, she removes her hands, and sits back up. This time, the oil is applied directly to Liz, poured across her chest. While it might be a bit cold at first, Naoki\u2019s hands set in once again to spread their warmth, starting around the shoulders before using a connecting stroke to slide her palms down the chest, and up across the breasts. A few full-handed grasping and kneading motions gradually transition into a gentle caress, and then light pinching, rolling the nub around between forefinger and thumb, always careful not to tug too hard, or push too far. After a few sensuous moments of that, Naoki withdraws, coming back up to the neck and head.  To begin the fourth and final stage of what can plausibly be called a \u2018massage\u2019, Naoki\u2019s hands make long, smooth strokes up Liz\u2019 siders to her shoulders, continuing up to use the backs of her hands to stroke the neck and chin. Moving up once again, the pads of Naoki\u2019s thumbs move in small circles as they slide from the shoulders up the neck to the base of the skull.Running her hands up the neck, Naoki cups Liz\u2019 head lightly in her hands, lifting it slightly off the sofa. Using her forefingers, Naoki presses into the small hollows where skull meets neck, moving in small circles to stimulate the erogenous zones there. Presently, she gently allows Liz\u2019s head to rest back on the surface of the sofa, bringing her hands back up to massage the temples with firm, circular strokes. Next, Naoki lightly traces the outlines of Liz\u2019 jawline, forehead, and nose, before moving to apply pressure to the center of the forehead, another point of tension release. Finally, to conclude the massage, Naoki begins to stroke and rub at Liz\u2019 ears, one of the body\u2019s more sensitive organs. However, like all good things, the massage draws to a close as Naoki removes her hands and sits up again, idly stroking at Liz\u2019 hair but not otherwise continuing the massage proper. For a moment she simply sits, allowing Liz to revel in the relaxation of the completed massage for a handful of moments.Naoki could opt to simply allow Liz to pass into unconsciousness. Goodness knows she needs some rest after all that. But they both know that Liz needs something else even more. Again Naoki stands, making her way back down to Liz\u2019 feet. However, instead of straddling, Naoki assumes a prone position, resting on her elbows and facing Liz.. Naoki uses her hands to part the feet before her, and with them, Liz\u2019 legs. Shimming upward, Naoki moves her body up to occupy the space between the parted legs, tracing one oiled finger up the inside of Liz\u2019 thighs. Wordlessly, she flashes Liz another predatory grin, and begins to address the one portion of Liz\u2019 body that was not covered in the so called \u201cfull body\u201d massage; the part that is most in need of a loving touch. Sometimes, the best way to deal with accumulated stress and tension is to build it up. To bring it all up, gathering it in one spot, in the forefront of one\u2019s mind. To bring it all to balance on the point of a needle, on the crest of a wave. And to leave it there, perfectly balanced, leaning neither here nor there, simply resting at the precipice. And then, just when it seems as if it can balance no longer, to allow it to escape, in great, cascading waves that seem to have no end. Waves enough to wash over one\u2019s entire body, to wash away all coherent thought, leaving one in a nirvanic state of bliss. Freedom of form and mind, oblivious to all external circumstances, simply riding the endlessly cascading waves of pleasure from one climax to the next. And sometimes this isn\u2019t enough. Sometimes this procedure needs to be repeated upwards of twenty times over the next three hours. Which is exactly what Naoki proceeds to do.When Liz comes to, she might notate that a few things have changed. First and foremost, she\u2019s lying on an entirely separate section of the seating area, and is covered from the waist down with a blanket. Instead of resting her head on a pillow, or simply the surface of the sofa, Liz\u2019 head is sitting squarely in Naoki\u2019s lap, who still hasn\u2019t located any clothing to replace her robe. One of Naoki\u2019s hands idly strokes at Liz\u2019 hair, as if her head is some small animal snuggled up between her thighs to be petted. Her other hand holds a book open for her reading. From her position, Liz may be able to look up and read along, and would find it to be a book about military logistics, of all things. Some light reading, apparently. A look toward the window would betray the fact that the sun has long since set, and the coolness of night has once again settled over Isra. Additionally, Liz\u2019 clothing is nowhere to be seen.If Naoki notices when Liz wakes, she doesn\u2019t say so, instead continuing to read away, studying the proper ways to supply an army. ", "1466965637000": "Noticing Liz\u2019 state of apparent consciousness, a faint sort of almost matronly smile makes it's way onto Naoki\u2019s face. It\u2019s rather amusing, she thinks, how a bit of restful sleep has taken Liz from shuddering moans of lust to 'good evening'. And, furthermore, it\u2019s rather cute, how she continues to use semi-formal address in a situation such as this, which stopped being any sort of formal several hours ago. \u201cGood evening, Liz. How are you feeling? Better, I hope. Else I\u2019ll have to try again.\u201dWith this, Naoki\u2019s hand strays downward, from Liz\u2019 head to her chest for a gentle pinch. The book-hand moves off to the other side, to rest the book face-down on the sofa.", "1466984173000": "\u201cGood. You needed that- both parts of it. There was a lot of pent up tension and frustration in you, and it was my pleasure to release it. Though, not as much as I\u2019m sure it was yours, judging by the way you moaned.\u201dWith a sultry sort of smirk, Naoki\u2019s right hand finds its way up over Liz\u2019 thigh and beyond, intending to elicit another one of those moans. There it remains as she continues, lightly teasing. \u201cAs for falling asleep, don\u2019t worry about it. I intentionally drove you to unconsciousness, and you slept well. I\u2019m still not sure if you\u2019re cuter when you moan or when you sleep, though.\u201dWithdrawing her hand, Naoki takes a moment to suck her fingertips clean, maintaining eye contact as she does so. Afterward, she withdraws slightly, and drops her smirk for a more sedate sort of half-smile, crossing her arms under her chest. Her tone also shifts, from the sensuous murmur to the somewhat more reserved, more respectful intonation. \u201cNow, let me ask you this, in all seriousness. I would request an honest answer, so take your time. What do you want?\u201d", "1467005542000": "Naoki nods thoughtfully. She didn\u2019t quite expect Liz to have a particularly excellent response prepared, but she also didn\u2019t quite expect the question to be turned around on her like that. \u201cWell, first, let me say this plainly, since you don\u2019t seem to have picked up on it.\u201d Turning to face Liz directly, Naoki continues with every bit of plain speech and sincerity she can muster.\u201cI care about you, Liz. When we first met, my relationship with you was purely business. You were my in to Isra\u2019s military. You gave me eyes, ears, and in some cases, a hand within the military of Isra. You provided information I didn\u2019t have. But as time has passed, circumstances have changed, and we\u2019ve both matured and moved up the metaphorical ladder, how I\u2019ve considered you has changed. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s not particularly easy to vocalise, but I\u2019m proud of you. I\u2019m not clear on the reasons why, though I suspect that it may be some product of your childhood, but you\u2019ve really applied yourself in a way that few people really do. You have pushed yourself to the very limit; you have drive and determination like few do, and that\u2019s something I find admirable, having had the opportunity to watch and facilitate your ascent.\u201d\u201cAlso: your butt. I like your butt. And the way that you\u2019re muscled and well toned, but offer no resistance as I explore your body.  And the way you moan, and the way you blush when you\u2019re embarrassed, and the dichotomy between how you\u2019re always so serious, so stony and whatnot most of the time, but like putty in my hands, so sensitive, and receptive to each and every touch. I\u2019ve found a new side of you that I doubt anyone really suspected you had, and simply thinking about that, I\u2019m finding, is a big turn-on.\u201dAlmost unconsciously, Naoki\u2019s tail finds its way up between her legs, where it begins to stroke idly. She doesn\u2019t mention it, or acknowledge it in any way, but yet, there it is, getting more and more matted with each passing second.\u201cWhat\u2019s less admirable is how you\u2019ve neglected yourself, and your needs as a person, but we\u2019re working on that. As for what I\u2019d like\u2026\u201dLeaning back, Naoki looks up toward the ceiling as she contemplates her response. This isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s been asked this question, she muses. And her answer has changed. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a question, that one, I\u2019ll be the first to admit. But the first thing that comes to mind is more hours in the day. I\u2019d like more time to do all of the things I\u2019d like to do. I have too many people I\u2019d like to spend time with, and too many responsibilities, and not enough time in each day to do everything I want to. My thought patterns are becoming increasingly related to schedules and time allocation. Like, after you fell into your peaceful slumber, I considered leaving you with a note. In the hours you were asleep, I could have been doing any number of things besides providing my thighs as your pillows. I decided not to, considering the impression that would give, and how important this conversation is in my eyes, but the fact that I considered it seriously\u2026 I don\u2019t like it. Even with the reduced workload I\u2019ve engineered by delegating so much to Ryden and The Conclave, even with the ability to communicate telepathically with the majority of my closest associates, I still don\u2019t have enough time to do everything I\u2019d like to, fulfill my responsibilities to my best capacity, and take time to myself.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s irritating. Foreseeable, but irritating, in that there isn\u2019t much I can do about it. So I\u2019d like more time, on a day to day basis, to do what I\u2019d like to. Or the ability to be in multiple places at once, accomplishing multiple tasks simultaneously. Or some equivalent. I\u2019m not sure. I\u2019d just like to stop having this problem, really.\u201d", "1467067683000": "Naoki shrugs, \u201cThere are a small handful of individuals who assist me with such things. Foremost among them being my dear Kate, Artemis- who you\u2019ve met. Between regular sauna sessions, Artemis\u2019 skill as a masseur- she far surpasses me, and regular intimacy sessions, I like to think that I\u2019m doing quite a good job of managing my stress, really. You shouldn\u2019t feel obligated to repay me.\u201dNaoki\u2019s gaze makes its way down to Liz\u2019 finger, idly tracing its way around on her thigh. She hadn\u2019t been speaking in jest when she said that she found Liz and her behavior to be arousing. This single finger isn\u2019t enough to elicit any manner of reaction, but\u2026 \u201cHowever\u2026  if you\u2019re offering\u2026 be my guest.\u201dTurning half to one side, Naoki flashes a lascivious sort of smirk, and waits to see exactly what Liz means by that.", "1467147696000": "Naoki chuckles a bit as Liz continues, still watching her finger trail down between her thighs. \u201cFair enough. I\u2019m willing to teach you a thing or two about intimacy. Or twenty. You\u2019re going to need to bathe after this, though.\u201dMoving to lie on her back, head propped up with some pillows, Naoki proceeds over the next couple of hours to coach Liz in the basics of the arts amorous and intimate. Having shared her expertise in this manner a few times before, at this point, Naoki pleasantly finds that Liz is a quick study. By the time they\u2019re finished, a trip to the bath is absolutely necessary. One decidedly steamy bath later, the pair finally find themselves back on the couch yet again, having found two more of those robes to cover themselves in. ", "1467163598000": "The silence only lasts a moment before Naoki breaks into a chuckle. \u201cHeh. It was my pleasure, but you have no idea. I haven\u2019t even exhausted the limits of what I can do without tools or assistance. Next week, we\u2019ll go further. Deeper.\u201dLiz is treated to just one more predatory smirk before Naoki relaxes back into the chair and adjusts her demeanor to better tackle the matter ahead. \u201cBut that\u2019s quite enough of that for now. You\u2019re getting a bit raw, anyway. Come sit with me.\u201dPatting the section of couch just next to her, Naok invites Liz in for the follow up snuggle. After allowing her to get settled however she pleases, Naoki continues, having banished the salacious undertone from her voice for a more comforting, almost matronly inflection.\u201cThere is one more thing I\u2019d like to speak with you about tonight. I\u2019ll begin this with a question, which I have asked once before, but I\u2019d like to hear if your response has changed. Liz, what do you know of your genetic family, and the situation regarding your early life?\u201d", "1467253661000": "Naoki nods. The same content, but less anger. That\u2019s\u2026 good, she supposes. After only a moment, she continues, \u201cI have more information. Quite a lot of information, actually. But I\u2019ll not burden you with it if you\u2019d prefer to leave your past where it is- in the past. You\u2019re in the best spot you\u2019ve ever been in, and there\u2019s not any particular need to be chasing your past around. However, it would also be wrong of me to know this information and not offer to share it with you.\u201d\u201cSo. As much as it pains me to, I offer you the choice. The option. I\u2019ll tell you what I know if you\u2019d like to hear it, but it may hurt. I won\u2019t hold it against you either way, and even if you\u2019d prefer not to hear now, it isn\u2019t as if I\u2019m going to forget.\u201d", "1467398195000": "\u201cFair enough. You can stop with the formal address though, Liz. This isn\u2019t a formal meeting, and hasn\u2019t been for a long time.\u201d\u201cLast week, last Tuesday, I received a visitor. \u201cHe seemed to be in his fifties. Tall man. About a half-foot taller than you and I. Kind of scraggly. Bearded, with little braids in it. Blackish, grayish hair. A hard sort of man. One who can act as if they\u2019re noble and chivalrous and all that, but isn\u2019t- really. He identified himself as Sir Eli Finch, and claimed that you are his daughter.\u201dHere, Naoki stops. Even though she hasn't said much volumetrically, what she said is a lot to take. Best to pause here and allow Liz to consider that, she figures.", "1467517217000": "\u201cYou were out saving the world, remember? He said something along the lines of, \u201cIf she knew I existed she would likely hate me, so I wish to spare her that.\u201d\u201dNaoki\u2019s impression of Eli is very nearly spot on. She cannot quite replicate the depth or roughness of his tone, but her impression is otherwise perfect. \u201cHowever, I\u2019m not about to keep something like that from you, even at his request. That\u2019s the sort of thing you should have the opportunity to know. So I\u2019ve told you. He left me something to give to you, but before I do, do you have any thoughts? Would you like me to tell you more about him? Would you like to talk about it?...\u201dNaoki trails off, unsure.  ", "1467761027000": "\u201cWell. Keep in mind the following. Simply knowing about or\u2026 remembering something doesn\u2019t mean you have to care about it. Doesn\u2019t mean you have to let it play a role or have a say in who you are today. You\u2019re a woman, Liz. One who was earned everything she has, and is the sole architect of her own fate. Make your own choices, and remember that you\u2019ll have my support, whatever they may be.\u201dA quick shoulder-squeeze punctuates that last statement. The relationship between the two is strange and multifaceted, and Naoki struggles to apply a term to it, but it seems to be one in which Naoki offers emotional support to Liz, and she\u2019s perfectly fine with playing that role. \u201cWith that said, let me show you this...\u201dDisengaging herself, Naoki rises from the seat, and climbs up out of the seating area as a whole. With silent steps, she moves out of sight behind one of the room\u2019s curtains. For a few moments, she remains there, leaving Liz with her thoughts. However, soon enough, Naoki\u2019s figure makes its way back into the room, holding something covered in cloth whose shape mean that it could only be a sword. (Either that or a toy of some manner, but it\u2019s a sword.)Carefully seating herself on the edge of the seating area, Naoki offers the covered object to Liz, withholding all further explanation. It ought to be interesting to see her initial reaction without any context, and what about the sword she will be able to figure out herself, Naoki figures. ", "1467831967000": "From her position behind and slightly to Liz\u2019 left, Naoki watches as the sword begins to glow, changing before their very eyes. Not very subtle magics, those, she muses. \u201cEli Finch gave it to me, to give to you. As I understand, it\u2019s your family\u2019s heirloom blade.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure if you read elvish, but this here\u2026\u201d She gestures to the wavy script, \u201cThis says Finch. In elvish. I hope you don\u2019t mind, I had a few of my experts have a look at it. They weren't able to discern much. Other than the inscription there, the nature of the magics, and the approximate age of the thing. As one could probably guess, the magics are related to bloodlines. Only coming fully into effect when wielded by one of the intended family. And the blade is several hundred years old. Again, not particularly precise. I\u2019m going to have to find some new experts for these sorts of things, honestly. As for the abilities, Eli, he mentioned fire. Try not to burn the carpet.\u201d\u201cAnyway, as he told me, your name, Finch, is a great ancestral name of some variety, predating the cataclysm. One of your ancestors apparently did something to earn great respect and a reward from some ancient race of elves. Hence, this blade. It seems to work, given how it\u2019s doing the whole light-up bit.\u201dStill seated as she is, Naoki stops speaking. It ought to be interesting to see what it does when she touches it.17-20jfYCmWyp", "1467859584000": "\u201cWell. That\u2019s probably because you\u2019ve never held your family\u2019s ancestral blade before, Liz. That\u2019s ancient elven magic, you\u2019ve got there. Old and primal. There are only a few things and individuals in Isra who have felt that sort of thing.\u201dNaoki states this rather matter-of-factly. However, as she does so, she begins to scoot off to the left, using her arms and legs in tandem to lift her bottom off the floor, and slide subtly off to the left. Her earring glimmers slightly as she does so, likely sending some manner of message to someone. However, her gaze remains fixed on Liz, and her blade. It\u2019s something of a spectacle, she muses. ", "1468056517000": "As the sparks abate and the blade is sheathed, Naoki slides down onto the couch proper, and moves back over to sit beside Liz. As Liz goes in for the hugh, Naoki isn\u2019t quite surprised. That was the sort of reaction she was intending to elicit, after all. After spending so long effectively alone, this meeting ought to be doing an awful lot for Liz\u2019 mental state. Intimacy- in all of its forms, is a fundamental component of companionship, which is in turn something that everyone needs some of. And while griffins may be excellent companions,  there\u2019s something to be said for sentience and Naoki\u2019s plushness. Again, Naoki reciprocates the embrace for what feels like the upteenth time, happy to indulge Liz. One hand gives Liz\u2019 shoulder blade an experimental rub or two, and Naoki is pleased to find it considerably more malleable than it was before the massage. And again, Naoki waits for Liz to break off the embrace first. Considering what she\u2019s just learned, there\u2019s no telling how long she needs it. ", "1468447128000": "\u201cYou do, don\u2019t you.\u201dWith that murmured statement, Naoki realizes the sheer amount of things she\u2019s laid on Liz\u2019 shoulders, between the various 'subjects' they've 'discussed'. An awful lot of introspection is going to be in order for her favorite griffin-rider. Naoki hopes she\u2019ll take it well, and come out the other side in a better state.\u201cWell,\u201d Naoki continues, holding Liz by the shoulders at arm\u2019s length and maintaining eye contact, \u201cYou have a week to do it. Remember what I implied about meeting here next week? Yes. Well. Forget about that. Instead, next Monday, sometime in the earlyish morning, you\u2019re to report to Port Silverion. There, I will meet you, and we will board a ship, and sail to Gauldin. You should bring St. George, a few changes of clothing, that sword- if you feel comfortable carrying it at that point, and whatever else you and he might need to enjoy a week or so abroad. You\u2019re taking a vacation. I\u2019ll see to it that you have no responsibilities to fulfill during the time I\u2019ve absconded with you.\u201dAn afterthought: \u201cOh, and, your garments will be sent to your quarters once they\u2019re clean.\u201d At this, Naoki smirks slightly, betraying only a fraction of her amusement. The mental image of Liz making her way across The Citadel and into the predominantly male barracks with only the provided robe is an... interesting one to consider. For a moment longer, Naoki makes as if to hold Liz by the shoulders. Just long enough for the implications of her last statement to sink in and hopefully inspire one last blush. ", "1468647641000": "Turning back about to begin tidying the room, Naoki responds in an uncharacteristically light and carefree sort of tone, \u201cI don't know! I've only just decided that we're doing this. I haven't gotten that far in the planning yet.\u201dWith the box of massage implements all packed up, Naoki spins about on one heel and saunters off into the curtains, with the box, her voice wafting backward, \u201cUnless you have a preference, maybe we start over on mainland Gauldin, and hit Carmella on the way back. I don't know how quickly we\u2019ll sail, through. Might not have time for all that. Depending on how long we stay, prevailing winds, and all that. We'll have to see. Your preparations shouldn't change, though,  I wouldn't imagine.\u201dThere\u2019s a pause as Naoki pokes about in the back. Stowing whatever business needs to be stowed and preparing to leave. Presently, she returns, seemingly unchanged save for one item- the return of her small black pouch, bouncing along on her hip. Approaching Liz, she speaks again, pacing about to place her behind Liz.\u201cSo. Unless you\u2019ve got anything further, I might be willing to allow you to go about your business.\u201d This statement is punctuated by Naoki\u2019s fingers finding their way down to grab a handful of Liz\u2019 behind; the literal representation of Naoki\u2019s joking metaphor. One might note, her grip is firm, but warm. Which could be a metaphor for something, if the reader would care to read into it. Naoki herself slides forward, pressing her chest into Liz\u2019 back and resting her chin on Liz\u2019 shoulder, even going to far as to raise her ears and one eyebrow inquisitively. It had sounded like Liz was leaving, but prompting for closing thoughts or questions never hurt anyone. Her grip isn\u2019t as tight as all that.", "1468891468000": "Naoki smirks a bit to herself as Liz is startled. That was exactly the sort of reaction she was looking to inspire. So cute. After sharing one more embrace, Naoki returns the salute with a lopsided grin, and waves to Liz as she exits. \u201cSee you later, Liz.\u201dAfter spending a few minutes to collect her belongings, Naoki also departs the Den, headed for destinations unknown.  ", "1471685000000": "The response from within the Den is far from immediate. About a minute or so after Liz and Crovan have entered, one pointed ear pokes up over the lip of the seating area. For a moment, it swivels about slowly, locating the source of the disturbance. Once it does, however, the rest of Naoki\u2019s head follows suit as she pokes the top half of her face up over the lip of the depressed seating area. One eye half-open, the other half-shut, and her hair frizzy and quite disorderly, it\u2019s clear that Naoki has only just awoken from her aforementioned nap.Poking her nose up over the lip, she addresses the pair of them, \u201cYou\u2019re back.\u201d This is stated plainly, but not without a hefty helping of residual sleepiness.Naoki takes a moment to raise one hand just barley up over the lip to rub at her eyes and then smooth the hair on the top of her head- right between the ears. Once the hand disappears again, she seems for all the world to have become totally refreshed- peppy, even. Slinging a smile in their direction, she addresses the pair again. \u201cWhat are you standing around by the door for? Come over here, have a seat!\u201dWith that, she inclines her head to her left, their right, indicating the seating area in the center of the room in which she is currently seated. A few things have been changed since Liz\u2019 last visit. First and foremost, the table is gone. Where? Who knows! But there is no table, only empty space where the table once was. Additionally, Naoki- for her nap, presumably, seems to have assembled a sort of\u2026 nest, perhaps. She seems to have taken the majority of the Den\u2019s pillows, cushions, and blankets and arranged them into a cozy sort of construction, in which she currently sits, covered up to the neck in blankets. There may be more changes, or perhaps... preparations, but they aren't apparent as of yet. ", "1472862888000": "As Liz settles in next to her in the fort, Naoki adjusts herself to accommodate her, shifting to the left. Once Liz has settled in, Naoki moves the blanket from beneath to wrap around her shoulders and cover Liz. Next, Naoki begins to gently trace one of her hands down Liz\u2019 side, underneath her shirt and down to slide the tips of her fingers between Liz\u2019 bare hip and her garments, holding her in a sort of one armed hug across Liz\u2019 lower back. Here, however, Naoki stops, waiting to see how Liz might react. However, Naoki\u2019s face betrays none of her shenanigans, looking for all the world as if she\u2019s simply awaiting Liz\u2019 response with curiosity. The blanket ought to cover both of their bodies sufficiently to visually conceal Naoki\u2019s movements from Crovan. ", "1473196174000": "Watching the proceedings, Naoki shakes her head slightly. Oh, the wonders of inebriation! This situation is playing out almost as if a poorly written work of erotic fiction. But then again, so does most of what Naoki does, she supposes. Regardless, she had intended to ease into things with a bit more tact, a bit more teasing, a bit more finesse. But it seems like Drunk Liz knows what she wants, and it\u2019s apparently between Crovan\u2019s legs. And\u2026 Naoki supposes that she doesn\u2019t have much a problem with that. Their \u2018goals are in alignment\u2019 or somesuch. Rather than proceed aggressively, Naoki continues down the gentle path, sliding about such that she\u2019s kneeling behind Liz, and sliding her other hand in between Liz and her pants, gingerly caressing. Though she is still mostly covered by the blanket and obscured from Crovan\u2019s view by the fullness of Liz\u2019 chest, one might find that if they chose to look, Naoki would be clad in nothing beyond a two piece set of lingerie that would seem, oddly enough, to be constructed out of white feathers. The fluffiest and most pure white feathers one has ever seen, at that. Comparable to the wings of an otherworldly holy being, even.", "1474192736000": "As Liz begins to retch, Naoki\u2019s hands find their way up out of her pants very quickly and instead move to propel Naoki away from Liz about as quickly as she can move.Which is to say, quite quickly. Once all is said and done, and Liz seems to be about finished for the moment, Naoki finds herself- clad as she is in nothing beyond those feathered undergarments, halfway across the room, sort of half-crouching, eyeballing the proceedings from a safe distance. The look on her face is one of incredulity, irritation, and mild surprise; sentiments that are also displayed in the slow lashing of her tail. Under her breath, perhaps not quite loud enough to be heard over the sound of Liz\u2019 chucking, Naoki mutters, \u201cFor goodness\u2019 sake, Liz.\u201dIn response to Crovan\u2019s inquiry, she stands upright- apparently not overly concerned with her relative lack of garments, and speaks, \u201cYes. Down the stairs you came up, the first door on the right, going down.\u201dSingling Liz out with one pointed finger, she continues, voice taking on a stern edge, \u201cYou. Once you\u2019re quite finished, go help him clean up. When you\u2019re both clean, come back up here. Leave the soiled clothing in the bath, and I\u2019ll have it cleaned and returned. I\u2019ll\u2026 see about the mess here.\u201dShe gestures with a vague wave of the hand to the remains of her fort in which Liz and Crovan are seated, intending to suggest that she will take care of the spill.The pair would find the bathroom to be quite a luxurious affair, done up primarily in white marble with pale blue ornamentation, and is easily large enough to fit quite a few individuals. They would find that it has everything one might need to clean one's self, and quite a few other tools beyond that, should one care to go digging about in the cabinets.\u00a0", "1474680149000": "Watching as Liz collapses, Naoki doesn\u2019t bother to mask her irritation, furrowing her brows and glaring as Liz\u2019 comatose form. She couldn\u2019t even bother to take off her soiled clothing. Grumbling quietly to herself, Naoki slinks over to the sofa where Liz is lying and assists her by removing the dirty shirt, which she proceeds to utilise to wipe the majority of the sick off her face. Afterwards, the shirt is dropped unceremoniously to the floor beside the chair. Without any further procedures, Naoki turns about on one heel and proceeds through the curtains at the back of the room into the area beyond. There she remains for the space of a few minutes before returning, a few items in hand. The first, a simple wooden cup, halfway filled with a funny sort of off-whitish liquid. The second, a small, well made but otherwise unremarkable wooden box, of the sort that one might expect to find jewelry or other small items in. Seating herself on the arm of the sofa nearest to Liz\u2019 head, Naoki proceeds to eyeball Liz. After a minute\u2019s worth of ogling, Naoki decides that Liz isn\u2019t nearly as cute when she\u2019s drunk as she is when she\u2019s embarrassed, and resolves to attempt to dissuade her from further drinking in the future. For the time being, however, it doesn\u2019t seem like she\u2019s going to be waking up. With this in mind, Naoki proceeds to open the box with one hand and dip the other finger in the cup. One would find- if they would care to look, that the box is segmented into four portions, each filled with a different color of some manner of clay. One blue, one red, another yellow, and the final black. Dragging her wet finger across the black portion, some of the pigment comes off, clinging to her finger. Very carefully as to avoid getting it on herself, Naoki then drags her finger across the area between Liz\u2019 nose and upper lip. Two careful strokes later, Liz is now the proud owner of a painted-on-mustache. Next, Naoki dips her next finger first in the cup, then in the blue, and moves downward to Liz\u2019 upper chest. Like this, Crovan would find Naoki upon his presumable return to the room. Still wearing the feathery lingerie, painting on Liz\u2019 comatose form. ", "1474773524000": "While one pointed ear swivels in Crovan\u2019s direction as he enters, Naoki\u2019s focus remains on her canvas. As he approaches, he would be able to see rather clearly that Naoki doesn\u2019t seem to be painting anything in particular, but rather creating abstract patterns. Tracing the contour of Liz\u2019 collarbone with the blue, before switching to the black to add some wavy lines trailing down her chest. Without a word, Naoki uses her free hand to slide the box of pigments and the cup over toward Crovan, gesturing to Liz\u2019 lower half- still covered in pants. What she intends ought to be fairly clear, but how Crovan responds will be somewhat telling, she thinks. ", "1475086769000": "Shrugging slightly, Naoki continues her work. \u201cSuit yourself.\u201dLeaving Crovan to do as he sees fit, Naoki proceeds to complete her pattern, furnishing Liz with a sort of necklace. Due to the way she\u2019s lying on her back, Naoki isn\u2019t quite able to reach around and complete the circle, but the front half of Liz\u2019 chest is more or less completely painted. Special care is taken when painting around and over Liz\u2019 more sensitive bits, Naoki intending to make her squirm a bit in her sleep, but no extra time is spent there, as that would ruin the color. After a handful of minutes, it seems like Naoki\u2019s work is more or less complete. Though she could continue down the arms and toward the legs, Naoki opts not to, instead nodding quietly to herself- apparently satisfied, and standing. With two swift strides, Naoki closes the gap between herself and Crovan. Completely. Standing at her full height, Naoki\u2019s eyes are roughly on level with his, and only a few inches away. As she maintains eye contact, Crovan would probably become aware of something warm, fleshy, and fingered creeping its way down the front of his towel to grab a handful of whatever may be down there. Her grip is firm but warm. Simultaneously, if not stopped, something fluffy would begin drawing small circles on the small of his back- a sensation he may find to be ticklish. \u201cSo,\u201d she begins, softly, but considerably more casually than one may be expecting considering the position of her hand, \u201cHow are you?\u201d", "1475211373000": "Crovan would find it somewhat difficult to take too much of a step back, considering how Naoki is gripping him. And though she allows him a bit of leeway, she takes another half-step forward to match, adjusting her grip, even kneading slightly, and smirking all the while- clearly and unabashedly enjoying watching him squirm. \u201cFair enough,\u201d she offers, barely a whisper. His attempts to cover himself are ignored and largely futile- she isn\u2019t letting go. He could attempt to remove her hands, but simply it isn\u2019t going to help when her hand is wrapped as it is.To further deepen his predicament, Naoki utilizes her tail to slide the towel off the rest of the way from  behind, sending it downward to the floor. Holding him close, Naoki leans forward, causing the feathers of her upper garment to press into the front of his chest. Silently, her face only a few inches from his, she quirks one eyebrow upward in an inquiry as she simultaneously squeezes with the gripping hand. ", "1475686952000": "Naoki\u2019s smirk widens visibly at Crovan\u2019s squeak. What an adorable little noise. However, she doesn\u2019t squeeze again. Not yet. Overuse will break a toy. Looking on as he composes himself, Naoki\u2019s expression is one of expectancy- as if she\u2019s expecting him to do or say something. After standing there for a moment, with Crovan\u2019s package in hand, Naoki supposes that he\u2019s simply going to stand there. Though some of her momentum was lost in the stall, Naoki doesn\u2019t seem discouraged. Releasing him, she takes another half-step forward and to the side with one leg, pivoting slightly such so that one of her feet is just between Crovan\u2019s own. The skin of her inner thigh and leg brushes- nay, is pressed up against Crovan\u2019s own, warm and unimaginably soft. Likewise, her feathered lingerie comes into contact with Crovan- also warm, even through the feathers. Leaning closer such so that her lips nearly graze Crovan\u2019s right ear, Naoki whispers, \u201cMay I?\u201d", "1475750113000": "With this permission granted, Naoki stops wasting time with foreplay. Sliding the foot between his farther forward, she hooks it to one side before pushing abruptly with the palms of her hands against his bare chest. If executed properly, this motion ought to trip Crovan directly backward, into the pile of pillows she had positioned him by. After giving him a moment to land and reorient himself,\u00a0Crovan would find Naoki\u2019s expertise to be the best bar none- assuming that Crovan has never been bedded by Cahryss, The Demonlady of Lust  . Through her masterful understanding and practice of the art she makes sexuality, Naoki sees to it that the pair of them are enjoying themselves to a great extent, though she remains dominant throughout the proceedings. Crovan gets what he wants, but only how she deigns to give it to him and is made to reciprocate how she sees fit. As far as the content and the \u2018how\u2019 itself, Naoki keeps things relatively simple, but quite varied. Never the same position twice, often utilizing the suspiciously convenient furniture and walls of The Den to provide leverage. On and on she continues for hours, seemingly insatiable and uncaring of any limits Crovan might have. However, once all is said and done, several hours have passed and Naoki has seen to it that he and she both are well and truly satisfied- emptied and filled, respectfully. After lying next to him long enough for Crovan to pass out, Naoki rises and takes a few paces across the floor to select her feathered panties from where it was tossed. Moving back to Crovan, Naoki carefully slides it down over his face, as to cover his eyes and nose, but not wake him. Likewise, she takes the bra and affixes it to Liz' face like a set of goggles. Snickering and dripping, Naoki leaves the pair of them to rest, exiting The Den. Crovan will probably be a bit sore for the next few days and may be unable to attain satisfaction to the same extent with any other woman. Liz will probably wake with a bit of a hangover, and Naoki's drawings all over her upper body.", "1477453614000": "The girls would be kept waiting for about fifteen minutes or so before the door opens, and Madame Naoki steps into the room. On this occasion, she would seem to be wearing a relatively simple sort of pinkish red blouse with peplum, and black trousers. After making sure that the door closes firmly behind her, Naoki saunters her way over to the seating area and seats herself across from the other women.\u201cHello Jun, hello Arya. I apologize for the delay, I was in a meeting. How are you both doing?\u201d", "1477645438000": "Listening, Naoki raises an eyebrow in Jun\u2019s direction but does nothing further. She\u2019s doing that bit where she\u2019s being melodramatic, and Naoki feels it better to leave her be than to bring it up and possibly initiate a conflict. Turning her attention to Arya, Naoki nods solemnly in agreement- it is a shame, yes, certainly- she doesn't need to be told that. However, as Arya's plan is mentioned, Naoki quirks one eyebrow upward and tilts her head to one side- apparently somewhat puzzled.\u201cAlright.\u201d Naoki gives Arya the benefit of the doubt,  \u201c\u2026 And how do you intend to do that?\u201d", "1477916712000": "Nodding a bit in acknowledgment, Naoki listens and contemplates her response for a moment before speaking. \u201cWell. \u2026 Isra has those resources. Healing magic isn\u2019t quite as rare as all that, among mages. I think that in reading a report last month, about seventy percent of all the mages of The Conjunction are competent in some form of healing magic, and a fair number have specialized into it. I\u2019ve heard that basic healing magic a fairly easy and practical thing, so I can see why.\u201d\u201cBut the thing about that is that I\u2019m already trying to minimize loss of life.\u201dHere, she pauses, fixing Arya with a somewhat flat look before continuing, \u201cThis war has been in the making for months. I\u2019ve already scoured Isra for any and all who are willing to utilize their skills of healing- magical or not, to assist the wounded. Some were willing to go directly into battle, and are actually enlisted with some of the legions. They wear green armbands to distinguish themselves. Other individuals were not willing to risk their own lives, and have joined the Medical Brigade, which is part of the greater Logistical Sustainment Corps.\u201d\u201cSo, you\u2019re going to have some difficulties if you intend to run around Isra to recruit for your organization, and I\u2019m not willing to reallocate any of the Medical Brigade to your command. Most of them wouldn\u2019t be exceptionally thrilled to be ordered to heal soldiers that- after being healed, fully intend to get back up and go run an Isran soldier through. Some of whom may be friends of relatives of the healers in question.\u201d\u201cBeyond that, it also seems somewhat counterintuitive to me\u2026 If you hypothetically have enough resources to heal both parties in an engagement and allow each of them to get up and go stab the other party until they end up back in your hospital, you would just be prolonging the engagement. \u2026 I could see it if you were going to charge the soldiers- because that would be business, but then that sort of defeats the purpose of a humanitarian organization.\u201d\u201cAs another thing\u2026 if you do do that- heal Goraian soldiers and allow them to get back up and continue fighting, you would become a target.\u201d Tilting her head downward, Naoki fixes Arya with a sober, humorless look, intending to convey that she is not being facetious at all. \u201cHowever!\u201d she cuts in before a response can begin, \u201cAllow me to state this, to clue you in, as it were. \u2026 This isn\u2019t a war against Goraia or the people in it. It isn\u2019t a war against the people of Medan or even the Goraian army. You may call me a politician for saying this, but this is liberation. Ideally, the only individuals who would even be so much as captured are the high-ranking figures of the Goraian government- those who have ordered the atrocities to happen.\u201d\u201cBecause the people- they\u2019re not bad people. It hasn\u2019t been very long. Most of the people, most of their soldiers, don\u2019t believe in it- believe in the state. They don\u2019t have any loyalty to the government or their superiors. They\u2019re fighting because if they don\u2019t fight, they\u2019ll be imprisoned, tortured, killed, or whatever else.\u201d\u201cAs such, this war, this liberation, this endeavor won\u2019t be nearly as difficult as it would be otherwise. The soldier to fear is the one who defends their homeland to their last breath, because if they don\u2019t, their wives, families, and daughters- the things he cares about, will be taken away.\u201d\u201cAlso to be feared is the he who seeks vengeance against those who have already taken what he cares about away, such as the Medanese refugee, but that\u2019s beside the point. What I\u2019m working my way around to is that in orchestrating this war, I\u2019ve given very specific, nonstandard orders. For example, before every battle begins, we will be announcing something to the effect of \u2018If you surrender, we will treat you properly.\u2019 And then we will. We will take captives wherever and whenever possible, and will heal them all, regardless. We will make it very easy for defectors, and difficult for their commanding officers. Ideally, this would be a bloodless liberation, but I\u2019m not idealistic enough to believe that. I have done what I can do and will continue to do what can be done to minimize loss of life and damage to Medan, but when one\u2019s opponent makes use of mind magics and threatens their soldiers into fighting, there\u2019s only so much that can be done.\u201d\u201cSo I\u2019ll offer this feedback, and then give you a few suggestions. First of all, I think it would be exceptionally foolish for you to travel into Goraia alone or unarmed, regardless of your intentions, and even more so to take a bunch of non-combatant healers with you. Odds are, based on what I\u2019ve heard, you\u2019ll be enslaved and forced to do as they bid- healing, or comforting the soldiers in other ways.\u201d This is offered in the most serious tone, with a cautioning and concerned look. Even though Naoki isn\u2019t particularly close to Arya, she still wouldn\u2019t like to see her among the rescued sex slaves. \u201cAnd, even on the off chance that they allow you to do what you intend without molesting you, you\u2019ll be working in indirect opposition to the goals of my legions, and that\u2019s simply not wise.\u201d\u201cFurthermore, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll have much luck trying to organize the sort of thing you\u2019re describing, mostly because all of my human resources are already in play. You\u2019re not really going to find many qualified and willing individuals in Isra. However, if you can assemble the sort of thing you\u2019re suggesting, perhaps by enlisting the aid of Gauldin or The Land Tillers where I have been unable to, I am willing to support you financially out of my own pocket- under the understanding that you\u2019re not going to needlessly prolong the hostilities.\u201d\u201cBeyond that\u2026 It\u2019s a little bit late for this sort of thing. As we speak, scouts have entered Goraia and have begun to relay data. The First Legion and Second Legions have already been deployed, and are en route to their respective destinations. I myself will be departing via teleportation tomorrow morning, and I expect the invasion to begin properly later that day.\u201dOffering a small sort of shrug, she continues, \u201cSo, I think you\u2019ve got a few options. Firstly, you could go try to petition some other nation or a private organization to provide the healers you need. If you do, I\u2019ll see to it that you get the other things you need, and are assisted however possible. Secondly, you could simply come with me tomorrow, and practice your healing individually, on the spot, with the healers I already have. Doing that would probably offer you the most opportunities to save lives, including those of the captives we take. Thirdly, you could also go join up with the Medical Brigade as they come along behind the legions, and fix up soldiers that are sent back, and see to it that the captives we take are treated well and kept in good health. To be completely frank with you, the current manager of the Medical Brigade is a bit of an idiot, and I don\u2019t need to justify staffing decisions to anyone.\u201d A not-particularly-subtle offer. With this monolog delivered, Naoki supposes that she should probably stop, and does, leaning back somewhat in her seat, and crossing her arms under her chest. ", "1478131043000": "In response to Arya, Naoki nods but raises a finger with the intention to imply that Arya should hold on for just a moment as Naoki rounds on Jun, a question forming on her lips, \u201cHold on there, Jun. Let me ask you for just a moment\u2026 Why are you at all concerned with maintaining neutrality in this situation?\u201dThough the look in her eyes states very plainly that Naoki has a lot of thoughts on the subject, Naoki does not continue, instead, waiting to see what Jun has to say in defense. ", "1478788138000": "Realizing that she woke Forni, Naoki takes a half moment as Jun and Arya are addressing him to calm herself and collect her thoughts before responding to Jun, \u201cI\u2019ll just offer this, and leave this matter at that. \u2026 If your friends don\u2019t take kindly to you taking up arms against things that you find condemnable, perhaps they\u2019re not the right friends to have.\u201dAs stated, Naoki leaves it at that, folding her hands in her lap and leaning back a bit in her seat, offering Forni a better vantage from which to peer. There\u2019s no need to convince Jun, and Naoki would rather not escalate the situation needlessly. Besides, she\u2019d much rather discuss Forni. He\u2019s an excellent topic. ", "1479394430000": "Listening to Jun and Arya\u2019s comments, Naoki smirks slightly. She finds it somewhat amusing that these two, the original holy duo, what with all of their chastity seals, affinities with heavenly powers and whatnot, have nothing but compliments, handshakes, and implicative comments for Forni. She wonders whether this says more about the girls or Forni. After the pair of them have finished with what they have to say and with shaking Forni\u2019s tentacle, Naoki glances downward, smirking slightly and somewhat pleased with how things are proceeding. However, before she can offer a comment of her own, to applaud Forni for his apparent skill in regards to women, Arya launches a question, and it has the effect of pulling a metaphorical curtain over Naoki\u2019s demeanor. The smirk fades instantly and her gaze glazes over, becoming somewhat blank. After a moment like this in silence, Naoki drags her head back up to level that blank sort of gaze at Arya, eyeing her with the sort of look one gives a distant friend or relative when you\u2019ve not spoken with them in a while and they ask about your pet, which died three years previously, or about a family member that has been exceptionally sick and you\u2019re trying not to consider the matter because thinking about it is painful, but there they go, asking about it. \u201cShe\u2019s not well. \u2026 Hasn\u2019t been well. Bedridden. Staying at the Chalet.\u201d This, Naoki offers in her blandest, most monotone voice, and her expression matches. Beyond this, she does not elaborate further, instead simply sitting there, looking back at Arya.", "1479795308000": "In response to the group's responses toward what she said, Naoki exhales slowly deeply and turns her glance downward to stare back at the eyes looking up at her. At this moment, Naoki\u2019s responsibilities, the weight of the world, seems to weigh more heavily than ever on her shoulders. Between the upcoming war, the combined stresses of managing a nation, and Artemis, her constant companion of ten years, never more than a room or two away, not being there\u2026 It\u2019s a bit much, all at once. And as therapeutic as it may be to try to tell someone about Artemis and her affliction- just to tell someone, both about the affliction and how lonely and broken Artemis\u2019 lack of presence makes her feel, now probably isn\u2019t the time.  Jun and Arya probably don\u2019t want to hear about it anyway, so Naoki finds herself welcoming change in subject Jun provides, and attempts to refocus her thoughts on what sort of amusing thing Forni might say in response to the stated question, and how Jun might react to that, or what Jun might do if she were to lean  forward suddenly. ", "1480060785000": "As Forni vibrates and scoots his way about, Naoki bites her lip but holds her tongue, making a mental note to investigate the extent of his abilities to vibrate at a later date. Then, he jumps, which startles Naoki but not quite to the same extent that Jun is startled. Giggling slightly, Naoki looks on as Forni begins to wriggle his way up Jun\u2019s arm, and derives amusement from the expression on her face as he does. As Jun speaks, though, Naoki\u2019s eyebrows truly begin to raise, and one ear twitches, as if unsure. Did she just ask Forni for a demonstration of his skills? She did. More than okay with this turn of events, Naoki turns her smirk from amusement to salacious and sidles her way over toward Arya in the spirit of inclusiveness. After all, Forni isn\u2019t as large as all that, and Naoki has some things of her own to demonstrate as well. She comes up from behind on Arya\u2019s left, placing her right hand on Arya\u2019s left shoulder, and looks around the shoulder to get a better look at Jun and Forni.Arya and Jun both, if they find themselves clearheaded enough to, might notice an amount of magic seemingly coming from Naoki, of the demonic but not at all threatening variety. At the same moment, the atmosphere of the room would seem to change slightly, to become slightly hotter, slightly heavier, and very probably translating those characteristics onto the room\u2019s occupants, along with somewhat increased sensitivity of the flesh and a certain sort of\u2026 open mindedness and sense of need intended to make one more receptive to carnal suggestions.However, the atmosphere is not at all overpowering. With the smallest amount of conscious thought put into the matter, one could, if they noticed it, resist its suggestions and retain a clear head. However, that doesn\u2019t seem to be Naoki\u2019s intention in the least. As she looks on around Arya\u2019s shoulder, she would, if not dissuaded, begin to rub the aforementioned shoulder gently, and curls what would presumably be her tail down around the inside of the other woman\u2019s leg in a rather sensuous manner. She intends to remain primarily an observer for a short while longer, and runs her tongue along her upper lip as Forni continues. ", "1480416691000": "If at any point, Naoki manages to catch Forni\u2019s eye and his eys only, the look she would give him would seem to say 'Yes, it\u2019s ok with me, do it, lather her up and screw her silly'.Naoki can be very expressive, sometimes.In any case, Naoki finds herself still quite satisfied with how things are going, but not in any particular rush. Even if all this meeting results in is some massaging and the shared utilization of Forni\u2019s skills, Naoki thinks that that would be alright, as far as she\u2019s concerned. That would be enjoyable enough -- Forni is no slouch when it comes to such things, and it would open the door to future meetings. However, Naoki isn\u2019t really one to settle for less than the ideal. \u201cYou know,\u201d Naoki begins, speaking softly to Arya, \u201cI\u2019m a very good masseuse.\u201dAs if to reinforce this, Naoki steps forward slightly and to one side to stand very close behind Arya, and pulls her hand backward simultaneously, intending to bring Arya to lean backward slightly onto her chest, the warmth of which would be felt easily through the light fabric of Arya\u2019s shirt. The angle at which Naoki is standing would -- if Arya leans back into Naoki and turns slightly match the angle, face her somewhat away from Jun and Forni, to where Arya would be able to see them by turning her head or eyes to the right, but not by looking directly ahead. Simultaneously, Naoki dials up the demonic magic a tad, intensifying all of its effects slightly but not altering it in any perceptible manner. Next, Naoki places both of her hands on the tops of Arya\u2019s shoulders where they begin to transition into the collarbone. Like snakes, they slide up toward the neck and then back down, taking advantage of Arya\u2019s choice of shirt to slide their way under, and into direct contact with the skin. They too, seem to be quite warm, and soft besides. In this manner, Naoki resumes the massaging motion, though the areas which she is able to reach are rather limited due to the way the pair of them are standing such that Naoki has to reach up and around,  and how the majority of Arya\u2019s back would presumably be pressed into Naoki\u2019s bosom, and thus inaccessible. Still, this doesn\u2019t seem to stop Naoki from delivering the beginnings of what she intends to be a truly excellent massage.\u201cWould you like to lay down\u2026?\u201d comes the question. The way in which it is asked seems to leave room for an alternative, but it is unstated. ", "1481338451000": "Breaking out into a bit of a smirk as Arya seems to be getting into it, Naoki continues her ministrations right up until the point where Jun starts yelling and Arya pulls away. At this point, Naoki\u2019s hands freeze in place while her ears wince at the sudden loud noise. She had been listening carefully to Arya\u2019s murmuring, and it\u2019s somewhat startling. Still, she recovers quickly enough and turns to observe as Jun smacks into the door.After Jun seems to have stopped and is sitting on the floor, Naoki lowers her hands to her sides slowly, exhaling deeply as she does so. The look on her face is one of exasperation and disappointment. Exasperation with Jun for being so difficult in this regard, and disappointment that she\u2019s gone ahead and ruined- or at least thrown a wrench in what was going to be an excellent massage for Arya. She could have just quietly excused herself and left, rather than causing a fuss and startling everyone. Still, Naoki doesn\u2019t have anything in particular to say. Jun doesn\u2019t seem to be badly hurt and she\u2019s far more qualified to treat herself than Naoki is, and Naoki doesn\u2019t have any comments she\u2019d like to voice aloud. So she simply crosses her arms under her chest, leans to rest primarily atop her right leg, and pouts her lips a bit, still eyeing Jun with some level of displeasure, but not so overtly as to be taken particularly seriously. In this manner, she stands silently, her effects on the atmosphere in the room still in place, but toned back down a tad. ", "1482472095000": "Naoki requires no further prompting. Turning away from the door, she once again aligns Arya in her sights and begins to sidle over to her. \u201cOf course. Just because some people\u2026!\u201d she calls in the direction of the door, \u201care prudish and not comfortable with themselves doesn\u2019t mean that the rest of us should wait. Go ahead and take your clothes off and lay down over here, it has a hole for one\u2019s face.\u201d Using her tail, Naoki gestures toward another item of furniture in the den, off a short way to Arya\u2019s left. It seems more or less like a couch, but an especially large one in length and width, without armrests. And, as stated, it does indeed have a hole for one\u2019s face, as well as a mild indentation where one\u2019s chest would lie, though whether this indentation came as a feature or is simply the result of use is unclear. Further, it also has a glass bottle mostly filled with some yellowish liquid sitting atop it, capped with a cork. In any case, the couch is of the high standard of quality that Naoki maintains, and seems to be more or less the most comfortable way possible to lay with one\u2019s face down.Though she doesn\u2019t address Forni directly, Naoki gestures over toward the aforementioned couch, suggesting that he be an active participant in the massage, and in the process, flashes him a grin, looking very much like the cat that\u2019s about to eat the canary. Moving toward the couch herself, Naoki also begins to disrobe. Why her top needs to come off to deliver a massage isn\u2019t explained, but it comes off regardless and joins her trousers in a small pile off to one side of the couch. From atop the couch, she takes the bottle, uncorks it, drips some onto one hand, re-corks the bottle with some difficulty and sets it aside, before beginning to rub the liquid between her hands a bit. Massage oil, presumably, though the bottle is not labeled. ", "1483409106000": "Never one to pass up a good ogle, Naoki reciprocates Arya\u2019s appraisal. For as accurate of a description Artemis provided, it is Naoki\u2019s opinion that observing the article itself firsthand is vastly superior. Smirking slightly, Naoki notes with some amusement that it\u2019s not very often that the other person is more eager than she is before she\u2019s even begun to properly tease them. That\u2019ll be the theme then, teasing, she decides. In any case, once Arya is laying down, Naoki doesn\u2019t have anything in particular to say, so she opts simply to proceed. Having adequately gotten the massage oil onto her hands, Naoki proceeds to put one knee up on the table, and from there, move onto the table. She positions herself in such a way that she straddles Arya, with her knees on each side Arya\u2019s hips, her feet resting near Arya\u2019s knees. Such as it is, it\u2019s impossible to avoid contact, so Arya might note that Naoki is quite warm. Perhaps unnaturally so. Simultaneously, Naoki dials back considerably on the portion of the magic granted to her which allows her to set the mood so perfectly. Down to a level that one might consider warm, but not quite hot. It wouldn\u2019t do for Arya to give in before the fun really starts, and Naoki figures that she has much more experience managing individuals without any sort of influence than the alternative. Additionally, Naoki makes a point of holding her tail up so that it does not bump Forni. After pausing for a moment to allow Arya an initial reaction/shudder/what have you, Naoki adjusts herself slightly to be a bit more comfortable, and proceeds to inform Arya, in one of her lower voices, \u201cI\u2019m going to begin, take three deep breaths.\u201dAt this point, Naoki places her hands on Arya\u2019s back, on her shoulder blades such that her thumbs are pointed upward toward the base of Arya\u2019s neck, and her fingers are off to the side. In this manner, she proceeds to breathe with Arya, attempting to ensure that the other woman is relaxed. For as much as she intends to tease, the massage isn\u2019t going to work very well if Arya is teetering on the edge the entire time.", "1484821391000": "Remaining still as she breathes with Arya, Naoki takes no further action until the breathing is complete. However, once it is, and after a short pause, she begins by sweeping her hands out from the base of Arya\u2019s back, rubbing at the shoulders. After a short while of this, she adjusts her focus to include more of the back, and the shoulders, using the pads of her fingers to massage the shoulders up toward the neck and base of the skull. From here, she proceeds back down to the back, placing the entire surface of her hands on either side of Arya\u2019s back, and rubbing up from the bottom all the way up to the shoulders, slightly increasing the pressure exerted with each successive motion. Then, she proceeds into a bit of petrissage. Between her fingers, Naoki kneads portions of skin in the general vicinity of the shoulders. This having taken a fair few minutes and being a very thorough process, Naoki finds the oil on her hands to be lacking. Turning halfway about, she motions at Forni, indicating the jar of oil where it sits on the floor next to the couch, suggesting that he bring it to her. Regardless of if Forni moves to comply or remains as he is, Naoki shuffles backward on her knees, coming to kneel over Arya\u2019s feet. \u201cGoing to proceed to the lower portion now,\u201d Naoki informs Arya.Now that the massage has moved below the back and is - for the moment- in an intermission, Naoki also opts to initiate a bit of conversation, keeping her tone light and low and her inquiry rather simple, \u201cWhat have you been up to lately? I haven\u2019t seen you around.\u201d", "1486641603000": "\u201cMmmh,\u201d Naoki responds. That was about what she expected. It\u2019s a rather respectable way to lead one\u2019s life, as she sees it. Defining one\u2019s self primarily through altruism is about as simply \u2018good\u2019 as is possible, and it\u2019s rather enviable, Naoki thinks, that Arya doesn\u2019t have quite as many strings attached, where acting in favor of one hurts another indirectly. Healing wounds is simple like that. She considers suggesting that Arya tells a tale from her travels, of which she likely has a few, but Naoki opts not to, given that there\u2019s not very much massage left, and she wouldn\u2019t like to hear only half of a story. Instead, she continues. Hooking one finger into each side of Arya\u2019s underwear, Naoki slides them down to just above Arya's knees. In a stunning display of self-control, Naoki offers no comment and takes no lewd action, but only proceeds with the massage, placing the palms of her hands on either side of Arya\u2019s lower back, and sliding them down up and over the hips and buttocks, down to the upper legs, and then back up. Then down again, and back up, shifting slightly each time as to properly massage Arya\u2019s rear. As she does so, Naoki pipes up again, \u201cDuring my meeting with The Demonlady of Lust, in addition to Forni here, she also provided me with some gifts of my own, which I think you\u2019ll enjoy\u2026\u201dAs Naoki trails off, Arya may notice some shifting demonic energies in and around masseuse, gathering up in preparation for some action. ", "1489088380000": "Her smirk widening, Naoki takes Arya\u2019s murmurs of consent for what they are and wastes no time in getting right to it. Over the course of about twenty seconds, by channeling demonic magic through the tattoo on her inner thigh, Naoki gains seven new appendages, six of which are long, sinuous tentacles emerging from the area around her shoulder blades. The six of them are all but identical: essentially the same color as their owner\u2019s skin, beginning thick at their point of origin and tapering down to points after perhaps eight feet of length. The six tentacles lack any particular features such as suction cups, ridges, lumps, or anything to that extent, and are actually quite smooth, though will turn out to be surprisingly strong for how smooth they are. The seventh appendage, meanwhile, seems to be the reason that Naoki needed to take off her bottom to deliver the message. At present, it is about the size of Naoki\u2019s forearm and defies polite description beyond that.Of course, Arya wouldn\u2019t quite be able to see any of this, as she\u2019s still face-down. Other than Naoki\u2019s hands withdrawing a moment beforehand, Arya would have no warning before a tentacle grasps each one of her wrists and ankles, and hoists Arya right up off the table and into the air. Not quickly, mind you, and not roughly, as this is all still in the spirit of the massage. Once up in the air, Arya is turned from a horizontal to a vertical orientation, and Naoki takes a few steps away from the massage table, as for it not to be an obstacle. Utilizing the two remaining tentacles as support, Naoki draws Arya\u2019s backside closer to her own front side, presses her chest into Arya\u2019s back, and adjusts Arya\u2019s limbs into something of an airborne spread eagle position for easy access. Reaching around with her own hands to begin massaging Arya\u2019s breasts, Naoki leans forward to smother the paladin's lips in her own as the seventh appendage makes its presence known between Arya\u2019s legs.Over the course of the next couple of hours, Naoki would continue with what she would call \u2018the massage\u2019. It would involve copious amounts of demonic magic, more unnatural appendages than one could reasonably shake a stick at, and would leave no no tension of Arya\u2019s unrelieved, no depth of hers unplumbed. Though the bottle of oil remains where it was left on the floor, lack of lubricant is far from an issue and may be able to be attributed to some facet of the lust magic inherent to the tentacles. The entire time (when her mouth isn\u2019t otherwise occupied) Naoki sports a peculiar sort of expression, the likes of which she rarely wears: a combination smile-smirk of genuine and unmasked enjoyment. It\u2019s quite gratifying, Naoki is finding, to make use of these gifts to make Arya, with her purity and chastity and whatnot, moan in such a manner. Additionally, with her \u2018aura\u2019 on at its theoretical maximum (How did that happen?), these activities ought to be generating quite a substantial amount of harnessable lust for The Demonlady, The Circle, and Forni, Naoki thinks.Speaking of Forni, he is, for this time, left largely to his own devices. Naoki is somewhat preoccupied and assumes that he will have the best sense of where (and into whom) to insert himself for maximum effect, and so only gives him very general instructions.Only after Arya stands on the brink of unconsciousness and her legs have given out does Naoki feel that she has completed the massage. After bringing Arya all the way up, holding here there for a few minutes more, and then bringing her down once more (for good measure), Naoki brings her down in a literal sense, placing Arya very carefully onto the cushions in the depression located in the center of the Den. Immediately afterward, Naoki utilizes a single tentacle to draw a blanket up over Arya, as not to let her get cold.Knowing she\u2019ll have a few moments to do so, Naoki seats herself on the floor off to Arya\u2019s right, and withdraws all of her extra appendages, leaving only Naoki herself, sitting naked amongst small piles of semi-demonic bodily fluids, and breathing heavily. More than anything, she seems satisfied with her work. ", "1491783941000": "As her breathing slows, Naoki smiles. Out like candles, the both of them. On a few particularly carnal occasions, Forni has expressed satisfaction with the \u2018meals\u2019 she\u2019s provided him, but Naoki will be interested to hear what he\u2019ll have to say about this. He must have gorged himself. Without much of a conscious thought on her part, a single sinuous tentacle emerges from Naoki\u2019s back, coils its way up her forearm, and into her hand. Beginning to stroke it, she revels in the sensation. Such a powerful feeling, so much more than anything she\u2019s been able to experience before. The pleasures associated with these bodily magics are exactly what Naoki had initially hoped to attain by dealing with The Demonlady of Lust, and in that respect, she finds herself satisfied. In the short term, however, Naoki is not quite satiated. Not yet. This fact, she finds unusual as she realizes it. Acutely aware of how much time has passed, and what all she has been up to in that time, she should, by all accounts, be quite satisfied and asleep with the rest. But instead, Naoki feels as if it\u2019s time for another. Time for more. Her eyes drift toward Arya\u2019s sleeping figure, and she smirks. Arya wouldn\u2019t mind some sweet dreams, would she?Quietly, Naoki moves over onto a cushion just next to where Arya and Forni rest. Reclining into it, Naoki feels no need to cover herself, still simmering hot with lust as she is. Sliding her sinuous tentacle over to the left, it slips under the hem of the blanket and into its destination. Naoki bites her lip in an attempt to stifle a moan, so surprised by the intensity of the feeling.All still in the interest of mutual gratification, Naoki tells herself. Still mutual. Perhaps a bit biased toward her own, in this case, perhaps, but she was doing all of the lifting earlier. Arya won\u2019t mind this, surely. Not when it feels this good.And in this manner, Naoki does her best to see to it that Arya\u2019s sleep will contain only the very best sort of dreams. Naoki does, of course, take care to see that such things are done about as discreetly as they can be, and hopefully do not wake Arya or otherwise interfere with her much needed slumber.However, Naoki herself does not sleep, as sleeping would mean stopping, and if these magics allow her to continue tirelessly, why shouldn\u2019t she? Her tail dangles off the far side of the cushion, the tip twitching occasionally. On the occasions that Forni growls particularly loudly, Naoki\u2019s ears turn to investigate, before going back about their business. In the hours that pass, Naoki idly contemplates a few matters (most of which are entirely indecent) and silently experiments with what sorts of exotic things she\u2019s able to do with these appendages of hers. If she can sense Arya beginning to stir toward wakefulness or otherwise suspects that Arya might be waking up, Naoki would slow before fully withdrawing. Otherwise, however, Naoki remains as she is pending further developments. ", "1494267612000": "As Arya wakes, Naoki looks on with a smile of her own. Watching Arya wake up, look over, and give her that smile - a smile Naoki doubts anyone has ever seen before, it speaks to a particular part of her, and it isn\u2019t the tattoo. As such, Naoki\u2019s smile is warm and genuine, conveying passion and affection, as opposed to a smirk implying impending penetration.While maintaining eye contact, Naoki replies in an equally soft tone, \u201cIt was my pleasure,\u201d relishing the last word.However, instead of moving to address Arya\u2019s next inquiry, Naoki instead moves toward Arya. Sliding underneath the blanket, she shifts all the way over to Arya\u2019s side to press up close. Now that Arya is awake, Naoki thinks, lots of things are back on the table, and cuddling seems like an excellent idea to her.After situating herself, Naoki sighs, and only sits for a moment before tilting her head slightly to one side to continue, \u201cSeveral hours have passed, the sun isn\u2019t to come up for a few more yet.\u201dWith an upward inclination of her chin, Naoki indicates one of the Den\u2019s windows. Though a curtain covers it, it\u2019s easy to see that there isn\u2019t any sunlight outside, and no muffled sounds filter through the walls, as The Citadel is still asleep.", "1495410155000": "Warm, and without anywhere else to be, Naoki is content only to lay quietly and share the moment- at least for a time. However, as Arya\u2019s hand begins to explore, Naoki opens her eyes, glancing over to the lusty woman beside her. Oh, how the tables have turned! In the interest of seeing just how far Arya will go, Naoki decides that this time, she\u2019ll have to work for it.Raising her arms up to rest on either side of her head and moving her knees apart, Naoki shivers slightly as she surrenders herself to Arya and her wandering fingers. The tattoo on Naoki\u2019s thigh shifts from black to red as she bites her lip, flashing an impish smirk and tenting the blanket up above Arya\u2019s hand. This time, no tentacles move to lift Arya; if she wants to get up, she\u2019ll need to do so herself, and it\u2019s Naoki\u2019s intention to lay right here until she does.Quite enjoying the attention so far and curious to see how the righteous paladin will choose to continue from this point, Naoki resolves to remain as she is and find out.", "1497777845000": "The hours and minutes pass Naoki by uncounted, so occupied is she with Arya and the treatment she\u2019s receiving. However, as the two are pausing for a few moments to rest, the first few rays of dawn slip through cracks in the curtains and cast themselves on the west wall. It is only at this point, having seen the sunshine lying spread on her back, that Naoki is mildly surprised to see that it is now sunrise, and remembers that there is, in fact, more to the world aside from this cozy corner of The Den. Hazily considering the details of the wider world, Naoki decides that she\u2019s not interested in it right now. Idly, she considers the concept of simply staying right here- up here in the Den, forever. It could be done. Fairly easily, it could be done. But in considering the specifics of how all she might like that to work, Naoki is reminded of her obligations to others and the world as a whole. In addition to her usual items, there is also the small matter of the imminent war. That will need to be dealt with, she begrudgingly supposes. But she won\u2019t necessarily need to be present for that for a while yet. And she certainly isn\u2019t going anywhere in this state. Moving her hair to one side as to be able to see properly, Naoki tilts her head up to take stock of herself as well as the state of Arya, and their immediate surroundings. Things seem virtually the same as a few hours previously, but considerably messier. \u201cThe floor below is a bath, what say we move down there, hm?\u201d Reaching with one hand, Naoki pokes the side of Arya's chest teasingly, with the intention of trying to gauge how she's feeling at this point. One would find the bath to be a large and luxurious marble affair with pale blue ornamentation. The room is centered around a central, circular basin embedded into the floor large enough to seat perhaps twenty comfortably. The insides of the basin(s) are tiled in deep blue, lending a sense of depth to the water, which is kept warm. In addition to the restroom off to one side, the room also features a few cabinets, some pegs- presumably for hanging clothing on, and a secondary basin, off to the left of the first and roughly a quarter of the size.", "1501040448000": "Rather than following Arya directly into the bath, Naoki first makes a detour to one of the room\u2019s cabinets. Bending to reach into it, she pulls a glass bottle filled with a purplish liquid. Sliding gradually down into the tub, she shivers. It\u2019s convenient not having to undress, she thinks. Turning an ear to listen, Naoki considers the question for a few moments before responding, \u201cA few hours, is the short answer.\u201dStanding waist high, she removes the cork from the bottle and begins to pour its contents out into the tub slowly. It smells of lavender - bath oil. She then continues, \u201cI intend to travel via portal once my presence is required. Or perhaps go soon and spend some time aboard the ship. I\u2019m unsure.\u201d She doesn\u2019t seem particularly enthused about the topic.Having poured the entirety of the bottle into the bath, Naoki corks it and sets down alongside other assorted bathing implements at the end of the basin. Over the course of the next few minutes, the oil diffuses throughout the water, adding a few essential oils and the aroma of lavender. Task complete, Naoki settles in, seating herself a portion of the way around the edge of the tub to Arya\u2019s left, as to sit across the diameter would be a significant distance. As she sighs, Naoki\u2019s ears visibly relax, as if deflating. After a moment, she remarks, \u201cIt\u2019s a shame Forni is still asleep. \u2026 He\u2019s very helpful in bathing, what with all his little tentacles and all.\u201d", "1520989830000": "One of the many features afforded by The Hospitality Den's special construction is such that from within, one is able to clearly hear any approaching up the stairs, on account of their creakiness. As such, Naoki\u2019s footsteps betray her approach before she\u2019s able to open the door.Entering, she immediately closes the door behind herself and eyes each of her guests in turn.\u201cI didn\u2019t know this was a formal event,\u201d she teases, cracking a smirk. \u201cIt seems I\u2019ve come underdressed!\u201d And indeed, The Empress would be underdressed for most social events, wearing only thigh high stockings and two pieces of exquisite but entirely (intentionally) ineffectual lingerie. Slinking her way over to Robert, she reaches out to test the fabric of his sleeve between her fingers. She isn\u2019t surprised to find it genuine.\u201cVery nice outfits, though,\u201d she says. Seemingly genuine praise.\u201cPut them away.\u201d With one sharp finger, The Empress indicates the wardrobe, the command clear.", "1521103725000": "The Empress\u2019s smirk widens. Robert\u2019s still trying to play it cool, of course, but Dixie\u2019s reactions are excellent. She\u2019s still young, naive, and beautiful, if not quite unspoiled. This will be much fun. Though, the dress\u2019s sacrifice was unnecessary.\u201cIt was,\u201d The Empress agrees. \u201cIt would have been fine just to take it off, there was no need for that.\u201d Her tone is casual and largely unconcerned. For Naoki, today is Tuesday.With the same casual flippancy, The Empress waves a negative in Robert\u2019s direction while she  looks at Dixie deeply and thoroughly. \u201cNo, thank you.\u201d After she\u2019s finished, The Empress runs the tip of her tongue across her upper lip and winks at Dixie\u2014just for fun, before stepping away.\u201cI have magic,\u201d The Empress states bluntly, placing her hands on her hips. \u201cExcellent magic.\u201dHer tone leaves little doubt as to what sort of magic she\u2019s referring to. \u201cWould it be quite alright with each of you for me to use it on you?\u201d she asks, looking between the two of them.", "1521175769000": "\u201cOh, you will,\u201d The Empress assures Dixie. Though, the way she says it, it almost seems like a threat.Turning abruptly on her heel, Naoki moves through one of the curtains into another portion of The Den. \u201cThis way,\u201d she calls. Upon following her, Robert and Dixie would find themselves in another \u2018room\u2019 of sorts, walled in with similar hanging curtains. If the sense of grossly superfluous luxury and wealth was not strong enough already, it may become so at this point. From the carpet to the bed sheets to the golden chandelier, every item in the room is of the highest grade available, intended to provide the ultimate in comfort and look good in doing so. Proceeding into the room, The Empress spends a moment to poke about and ensure everything is in order after the last cleaning. Depending on where their eyes are, Robert and Dixie may notice that the rose tattoo on Naoki\u2019s inner thigh has shifted from black to red.Everything seems to be fine, and The Empress nods to herself before turning back around. \u201cRobert.\u201d She points. \u201cOn the bed. On your back, limbs spread.\u201d\u201cDixie, over here.\u201d Standing next to the bed, The Empress indicates a position on the floor to her immediate right.", "1524158827000": "\u201cMany things, Dixie, many things...\u201d Reaching under the side of the bed, Naoki gropes about, looking for something.\u201cHowever,\u201d she continues, pulling out one end of a red skilen rope, \u201cThe first thing I intend to do is teach you how to tie a knot. Look here.\u201d\u201cWhat we want to do is tie poor Robert down, but not in such a way where it will squeeze his extremities off. So we\u2019ll take the rope and his ankle\u2026\u201dGrabbing one of Robert\u2019s ankles, she yanks it closer, as to be easier to work with. Ignoring whatever comments he might have, she continues speaking to Dixie.\u201cFirst, we loop it around right here, above the joint. If you tie around the joint, you run the risk of breaking him. Then bring the rope under, across itself like this, another loop, then cross it back, up through here, down through there, and arrround for a third loop in the other direction like\u2026 this. And then pull the slack through here.\u201d\u201cTying it like this makes it such so that no amount of pulling on his part will pull tighten the rope or loosen the knot.\" To demonstrate, she yanks the rope a bit. \"Once we\u2019re finished with the other knots, we\u2019ll come back and tie the other end here at the right length, so he\u2019s centered.\u201d\u201cNow,\u201d she says, \u201cYou try his arm. I\u2019ll help.\u201d Motioning, she gestures to the adjacent corner of the bed, under which Dixie would find an identical rope.", "1535929867000": "\u201cNeedlepoint?\u201d The Empress sits on the side of the bed to give Robert a few experimental tugs. It seems like he\u2019s ready. \u201cIs that what they\u2019re calling it, these days?\u201dTaking Dixie by the shoulders, The Empress maneuvers her about to the foot of the bed such that she might look down upon Robert. Standing behind her, Naoki slips one hand between Dixie\u2019s legs and uses the other to ever-so-gently push on the small of her back, bending Dixie forward until she would be gagging\u2014were she not so skilled with needles.\u201cThere we are\u2026!\u201d Naoki says, pleased with things so far. \u201cJust like that.\u201dThe Empress takes the hand on Dixie\u2019s back away and leaves her to it for a moment, gently teasing with her other hand. Then, Dixie would feel something touch her. Something that didn\u2019t quite feel like a finger. Then something else begins to slither around her thigh\u2014and it definitely isn\u2019t The Empress\u2019s tail. Should Dixie move as if to get up and look behind her, The Empress\u2019s hand would be there on the back of her head to hold her down. \u201cAh-ah-ah\u2014you stay there until the job is done.\u201dThey would remain on this lesson until Dixie is successful, at which point they would proceed to An Introduction to Tentacles. While Dixie recovers, The Empress would then teach Robert obedience and self-control. After that, it would be time for some more rope exercises, followed by Tentacles 102, this time with Robert participating. After Snack Break, The Empress would administer an assessment, challenging them both to put what they\u2019d learned into practice.Neither Robert nor Dixie would remember anything past the assessment, but evidence suggests that the night continued for some time after that. How The Empress fit all of these activities into a single night is anyone\u2019s guess, but a good guess would be \u201cvery responsible use of time magic.\u201d The two of them would wake sometime the following day, tucked in together in the bed. The Empress is nowhere to be found, but she had breakfast sent up. Next to the bed on two little stands, there are two little trays of food. Scrambled eggs with bacon, a biscuit, and plenty of water.At some point during the night, The Empress found Robert lacking and decided to remedy the issue with magic. It was one of her best ideas in a while, but at the time she did not give any thought to the potential permanence of the spell or how Robert\u2019s pants might or might not fit the following morning. In addition, Robert sustained some bruises and will likely feel sore for some time.Dixie, for her part, came out relatively unscathed. She will be sore, definitely, (both of them may be well suited sitting on cushions for the rest of the week) and likely also rather bloated, but otherwise none the worse for wear. The two of them would be free to eat, dress\u2014perhaps clean themselves first, and show themselves out.", "1572382894000": "Khepri is provided with tea and biscuits and told that The Empress will see her shortly. After almost an hour, a new pageboy comes to tell Khepri  that The Empress will see her now, and would she please follow him. Rather than heading a few doors down to The Throne, the pageboy leads Khepri on a jaunt to the back portions of The Citadel that aren\u2019t explicitly prepared for guests. He leads her up a goodly number of stairs to a room in one of The Citadel\u2019s smaller spires. Pushing the door open, he gestures for Khepri to enter while he himself remains in the hallway.Once over the threshold, the elevated doorway provides an excellent vantage from which to see that the room is round, occupying the entire floor of the tower. Tall windows spaced evenly around the outside let in much of the midday sun as to better illuminate the gross display of wealth held within. \u2018Hanging fabric\u2019 seems to be the theme, with generous swatches of shimmering gold, night-dark black, crimson, scarlet, maroon, and all other tasteful shades of red of hanging from silken ropes tied to pillars place around the room. Much of the fabric is transparent, but that which is not obscures the majority of the room, leaving only the third closest to the door visible. The shag carpet is an inoffensive shade of gray, which helps to offset what would otherwise be a stifling sense of heat from all the warm colors. As it is, the room certainly feels warmer than the stone of the hallway outside, and maybe it is a few degrees warmer inside.In the center of the room, there is a depressed dining area \u2014 small and circular, appropriate for perhaps five at most. A plush couch covered in rich, wine-colored velvet rings around a table of cherrywood, and the whole affair is accessible via a small set of stairs facing the door. And sitting there on the far side of the couch facing the door is none other than The Empress Herself.She, too, is in keeping with the theme, with partially transparent fabric hanging off her very person \u2014 a slinky little black and red dress. A garment of velveteen black is overlaid with a sash of diaphanous red and accented by intricately patterned silk covering the best and one leg. The whole ensemble comes close to being modest, but ultimately misses the mark.By the time the door is open all the way, Empress Naoki is on her feet and climbing the stairs to meet her guest, having left a half-eaten brownie on the tray with what few of its fellows remain. She eyes her guest as they approach, a friendly but distinctly smug look on her face.\u201cGreetings,\u201d The Empress says, none too formal in her address. \u201cI apologize for the climb, my throne room is being cleaned.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0(It isn\u2019t.)", "1572655986000": "\u201cNot just for looking good, then,\u201d Empress Naoki remarks, considering what her guest\u2019s wingspan might be. They have an exceedingly\u2026 paticular set of features that are very much exactly that: features. It\u2019s more than a little bit distracting; though the slightest bit beastlike, she\u2019s gorgeous by all conventional standards, and Naoki suspects that she tends to be very successful in her ventures \u2014 much like a certain someone.One, two beats.\u201cBut come, sit!\u201d Gesturing, Empress Naoki turns to go back down the stairs. \u201cIntroduce yourself, have some brownies, tell me why you\u2019re here and what you have to say!\u201d\u201cYou strike me as a likable sort,\u201d she adds as she seats herself, \u201cAnd you have my full attention. ...

She nods in confirmation: she certainly does know of Paradise, and the recent news of its disappearance occurs to her just as Khepri mentions it.Despite the fact that Paradise was not a de jure territory of Isra and her life is no different for it being gone, Naoki developed a certain fondness for its residents, similar to that she has for her own citizens. Some \u2014 like Kauri \u2014 were, prior to being stranded on the island, and many now are, having been rescued and resettled into Chimera Commons. So Naoki was disappointed to hear Paradise disappeared but must be nothing in comparison to what Khepri must be feeling. To have lost her home, and to be adrift in such a manner\u2026 It\u2019s horrible \u2014 Naoki knows. It\u2019s not a topic she raises in discussion, but she\u2019s older than The Free City, and it will suffice to say that she knows. That, on top of the Paradise bit, compounded by how much Khepri reminds The Empress of herself, makes a play toward her compassion trivially easy to pull off.Though she\u2019s momentarily taken aback, Empress Naoki quickly nods. \u201c... I certainly do,\u201d she responds, giving the matter no further thought.\u201cIf you\u2019d like (and we will, later), we could go through the song and dance of asking about your skills, figuring out what you can offer me, working out an agreement, and all of that, but I won\u2019t hold you in suspense for a moment longer: you needn\u2019t worry if The Empress will have you \u2014 she will.\u201d\u201cBy my power as Empress of The Isran Empire, I will see to it that you are found an appropriate position. If one does not exist within my court, I will create it,\u201d The Empress declares, pressing her finger into the tabletop.\u201cYou\u2019ll not leave here without a purpose and home that suit you,\u201d she says, leveling the same finger at Khepri. By the tone of her voice, it\u2019s unclear if that\u2019s intended an assurance or a threat. The Empress seems all but incensed about what she sees as a great injustice, to an extent she rarely is driven to. The last time she was bothered to such an extent resulted in the invasion of Goraia, but hopefully, this matter will be relatively enjoyable by comparison.", "1574134493000": "\u201c...

Failing that, you could deliver messages, brew tea, serve as an Imperial Praegustator, feed me grapes one by one as I luxuriate in the shade of my box at the arena watching gladiators compete in bloodsport for my amusement \u2014 or any number of other things. I employ children of twelve; we\u2019ll find something for you to do,\u201d Naoki assures Khepri.\u201cBut that would be a waste of your talents,\u201d she continues, waving the thought away. \u201cWhatever they may be.

She would rather like to hear of Khepri\u2019s participation in The Hunt, and the prospect of hearing the golden bird sing is an attractive one \u2014 but not now. Instead, The Empress murmurs approval. \u201cIt is regrettable that I have no courtesans, and you will grace my court by being the first.\u201d Intended as a genuine compliment.\u201c...Of course, you have a fine idea of what your responsibilities will consist of,\u201d she continues, \u201cand I will be looking forward to a demonstration of your knowledge.\u201d The look Empress Naoki gives Khepri at this point leaves little doubt as to exactly what she\u2019s signing up for. But she does not suggest Khepri begin immediately, as there\u2019s more to be discussed.\u201cBut I will caution you: I don\u2019t hold court daily. I\u2019m unsure what sort of arrangement there may have been in your Aerie, but I have not so much a court of advisors as a cabinet of ministers.

Which is not to say that all the frivolous practices of royalty are shirked,\u201d Naoki clarifies, \u201cBut you will be left with a great deal of free time.

If it\u2019s my lap of luxury that you\u2019re to be living in, I wouldn\u2019t like to be receiving seconds.\u201dWith a vague hand gesture, The Empress feels like that's a fair ask. She doesn\u2019t want her new birbslut to go touring the fine beds of Isra whenever she\u2019s busy with Imperial business; The Empress\u2019s Courestean should be exactly that \u2014 The Empress\u2019s, and she shouldn\u2019t have to share with anyone.\u201cThat said, it\u2019s not something I would toss you out over. Sometimes, people are concerned that I\u2019ll have them fired or jailed over minor infractions, but not so in this case.

The line would stretch all the way down the stairs, as it did when I asked for suitors. Instead, why don\u2019t you take it upon yourself to scout for talent as it were? Somehow, I suspect you\u2019d be good at that \u2014 and I don\u2019t mean that as a slight.\u201d The task is not one that The Empress herself would be found doing, but Khepri seems a discerning sort, capable of vetting candidates on her own.

Swiftly rising from her seat, Naoki steps barefoot up onto the table and closes the distance between them in a single stride. The height advantage puts Khepri's face at chest-level \u2014 exactly the right height to do what she has wanted to do since their meeting began!Slowly, gently, with every ounce of skill and finesse she\u2019s accumulated in her years, Naoki strokes Khepri\u2019s outstretched wing.Once. Twice! Then the other one \u2014 to see if it\u2019s as soft as the first.After the third stroke, Naoki realizes what she\u2019s doing and steps back just as swiftly, nearly sticking her foot in the brownie tray. After a moment, she clears her throat and mumbles a half-apology; she probably should have asked.\u201cRegardless,\u201d Naoki continues, \u201cThere\u2019s a bed back there.\u201dStepping off the table and starting toward the curtains in the rear, she calls over her shoulder. \u201cAnd you can leave your dress there!\u201d", "1581225038000": "In this case, Naoki allows herself to be led. It is a strange feeling, not because of the feathers, but because it is usually she who does the leading. All but never does she allow her partner to set the pace or push her around like this, but in this case, it\u2019s just so\u2026 easy.It\u2019s easy to have her dress slipped off, to be disrobed in such a manner. It\u2019s easy to be pushed back onto the bed, to be set upon, and to be led to the heights of ecstasy by one who, by every estimation, is entirely qualified for the position that she has just secured.It will not always be as such, and there are still surprises in store for dear Khepri, but for now\u2026 with the lazy afternoon sunlight streaming in the window, warming Naoki\u2019s bare skin and reflecting every which way off the feathers of her new newest friend, it all seems very right.One could grow used to this sort of treatment very easily, and Naoki has every intention to. Getting a courtesan was the best idea she hasn\u2019t had in at least a month. Some days as The Empress are difficult, filled with difficult choices, bureaucracy, death, and so on. On other days, beautiful women come to her door to request the honor and privilege of serving her. The latter makes the former bearable, and on blessed days such as these, Naoki finds that it\u2019s good to be the king.", "1581907204000": "An indeterminate amount of time later, Naoki arrives. She has traded her towels for a robe of a deep crimson hue, which looks quite warm. It comes down past her knees and does admirably to cover her, but remains an aggressively informal garment. Along with this, her hair has been styled impeccably, drawn back into an elaborate braid of similar shape and color as her tail.She shuts the door gingerly behind her, and it clicks shut, locked. Ulfang isn\u2019t hard to spot in amongst the warm colors of The Den, so in her matching slippers, Naoki meanders over.Standing next to him, she looks out the window. The city continues to hustle and bustle below them, wholly unaware. She asks, \u201cThoughts?\u201d", "1581914094000": "At his last comment, Naoki shoots Ulfang a side-eyed glare that is neither irritated nor displeased. That was the correct answer.Otherwise, she nods, watching a cart cross the Plaza. \u201cUnderstandable. Similarly, I would likely look out across your Vale and think it a rather lonely place.\u201d\u201cYours is a hard throne for a hard man, and I am the inverse. I rather like the plush; it\u2019s soft, warm, and difficult to be hurt by. If I aim to relax, there is nothing better.\u201d Looking over at Ulfang, Naoki considers him for an extended moment. \u201c... You and I are opposites in many ways, but I am glad we are not at odds.\u201d\u201cBut I am not one to leave a job unfinished; the massage table is over here\u2026\u201d Leading the way across the room, Naoki pushes aside a curtain to reveal the furniture in question. In keeping with the theme, it is a finely made, ornate piece of furniture, commissioned, no doubt. Unlike the chairs back in the Lounge, the table was not necessarily built with anyone in particular in mind but was constructed to significantly larger dimensions than it would need to be to accommodate the average human lying flat atop it. The surface is a thin mattress of some variety, covered by a red silken sheet, carefully cut to accommodate the face hole. It comes up to about the level of Naoki\u2019s stomach, and helpfully even has a few little stairs built-in. The underside has large shelves which are partially filled by towels, albeit not large ones.Running her hand along the top of the table as she walks past it, Naoki proceeds to the cabinet at the far end to select an oil. Sorting through, she picks a few she likes and calls over her shoulder, \u201cWould you prefer lavender, rosemary, or the same mint?\u201d", "1581919805000": "\u201cVery well.\u201d The lavender and rosemary go back into the cabinet. Turning around, Naoki inspects Ulfang nevertheless, never once having been coy about her ogling since assuming power. It would be in poor taste to comment aloud, but Naoki\u2019s ever-present aura of smugness intensifies just a bit.But then that makes it her turn, Naoki supposes. The robe comes off with stunning ease, leaving her in naught but her undergarments: black, lacy, partially transparent slips of fabric that leave some to the imagination, but not much. Quite tasteful, but also functional. Naoki is content merely to place her robe atop the cabinet, giving Ulfang about as much of a show as he gave her and a similar amount to be seen.But enough preamble. \u201cLay down then,\u201d Naoki gestures, taking a bit of oil into her hands and beginning to warm it. ", "1581923299000": "The width of the table makes standing alongside it impractical, so Naoki places the oil near Ulfang\u2019s shoulder and ascends the stairs. The view isn\u2019t bad from that angle either, but Naoki is taking the massage thing seriously. Nudging his legs together, Naoki kneels, straddling him, such that she might reach his back. Her arms only barley stretch far enough to reach his shoulders, but she tries to pick up where she left off, rubbing and kneading in her tender manner. However, Ulfang is just so damn big that this can\u2019t be accomplished without all sorts of saucy friction between her thighs and his sides. Her legs are long, but not long enough to straddle an absolute unit of this magnitude without touching him. She tries to continue regardless, but a glance downward tells her that neither one of them will last long enough to complete the massage at this rate.\u201cHmmh.\u201d Naoki furrows her eyebrows and considers the problem before her. \u201cAh.\u201d She stands. Standing, Naoki can straddle Ulfang without rubbing, but she isn\u2019t about to throw out her back trying to give a massage bent over in such a ridiculous position. Rather, she steps up, onto Ulfang, and begins massaging him by pressing the soles of her feet into the tense muscles of his back and kneading out with the ball of her heel.\u201cNow admittedly,\u201d Naoki says, careful and deliberate in both word and step, \u201cI am not nearly as practiced in this method of massage. ... But your back is an absolute atrocity that needs any relief it can get, and this will help.\u201d", "1582006455000": "Ulfang\u2019s remark earns him swift admonishment in the form of a bap to the back of the head from Naoki\u2019s tail.\u201cYou hush, you\u2019re not here to make smartass comments. \u2026 Be smaller next time.\u201d This is not a denial, per se, but it\u2019s not his sass she\u2019s interested in. Regardless, the massage continues, a bit faster, and with a bit more force than before. It isn\u2019t as though Ulfang is fragile \u2014 she could probably jump up and down on his spine and that would help. Still, there\u2019s a distinction between hard musculature and tension, and working the tension out of Ulfang\u2019s back is satisfying, in a limited sense. He was very much in need of it, and that one time that she walked all over him will be something fun to reference later.But after a time, Naoki stops and steps off to the side. \u201cI could continue,\u201d she says, \u201cBut how\u2019s that for now? Your back ought not to creak anymore, at the very least.\u201d", "1582610343000": "As she looks down upon Ulfang, Naoki\u2019s expression says \u201cDon\u2019t push it,\u201d but her popped hip and the mischievous way that her tail is curling suggest that she\u2019ll permit it.\u201cOh, I can see that your legs are throbbing,\u201d she quips, \u201cAll three of them.\u201dBut prodding the offender with her foot seems only to exacerbate the problem \u2014 as she hoped it might. In a novel variation on her initial strategy, Naoki swings one leg over and kneels straddling Ulfang\u2019s midsection. She then wraps her tail once around and gives a few experimental strokes, watching Ulfang\u2019s face to see what he thinks of that. \u201cYou won\u2019t be left wanting,\u201d she assures him, \u201cAnd seemingly neither will I. Just leave it to me.\u201d The last clause comes off as a bit pointed, because it is. Making silent eye contact, Naoki points one warning finger at Ulfang. She trusts him, their goals are one and the same, and she doesn't expect any trouble, but he would do well to maintain the same degree of self-control he has displayed throughout the day if he expects to be offered this opportunity again.Leaning forward, Naoki plants her hand squarely in the center of Ulfang\u2019s chest. It\u2019s warm to the touch. Using him for leverage, she pushes herself back, back, back\u2026 All the way back and all the way down, until she\u2019s seated comfortably in Ulfang\u2019s lap. There, she wiggles around a bit to get comfortable and smirks the most devilish of smirks. This will be her throne tonight.It ought not to surprise Ulfang that Naoki is skilled in her hobby of choice. What may come as more of a surprise is her enthusiasm, and the seemingly boundless stamina she displays over the course of the night. Time and time and time again and she keeps going. On the massage table, on the futon, over the table, on the floor. She insists on variety but does not tire, equally as enthusiastic the ninth time as she was the first. She is insistent upon taking all that Ulfang has to give down to the very last, and is not subtle in so expressing. When questioned, she reminds him of the purpose of his visit. It isn\u2019t as though he has anything to complain about. ", "1462161852000": "For a moment or so, the guards simply stand there, considering Ryden with two pairs of steely eyes. After a small handful of moments, they nod in unison, and the one on the right says, \u201cVery well,\u201d before shifting his spear to his left hand and using his right hand to push open his section of the double door, a motion mirrored by the other guard a second later, resulting in the doors opening in a very uneven fashion.Regardless, the doors open, allowing Ryden passage past this final barrier and into the office itself. After he enters, the guards shut the doors behind him to allow the occupants of the room a level of privacy. Predictably, Madame Naoki is sitting at her desk toward the far end of the room. The desk itself is piled high with documents, scrolls, and other such bits and pieces of paperwork. A quill - still wet - sits in its holder, presumably where she placed it to give her full attention to this visitor. She herself sits in her high-backed chair, arms folded across her chest, eyes directed toward the door- and toward Ryden. The upper portion of her body is covered by a cream-colored, cabled cashmere cardigan, over what would seem to be a relatively simple black dress. The rest of her body, including her additional furry appendage is currently out of sight below the desk. Artemis  stands to her immediate right, cooly regarding the newcomer.Naoki\u2019s expression is fairly neutral, as expressions go, as she considers him. An interesting sort, he seems at first glance. Apparently here to inquire about a position within her new government, if he can be believed. Perfectly willing to hear the man out, she gestures to the chairs that sit before the desk, wordlessly inviting him to sit down and introduce himself.", "1462167653000": "Madame Naoki nods, somewhat impressed with Ryden\u2019s knowledge. It is, of course, correct, but she hasn\u2019t yet distributed advertisements or professed her search publicly. His information must be either primarily inference, or sourced from someone within one of her inner circles. Also interesting, he doesn\u2019t seem to have reacted in any discernable manner to her ears. Either he was aware before his arrival- her physiology was hardly a secret at this point, or he\u2019s able to take those sorts of things in stride quite well. \u201cIt is a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Sir Greyiron, and you are quite correct.\u201dWith a tilt of her head, arms still crossed, she indicates the mounds of documents present on the desk between them. \u201cI am still in the process of making major alterations to Isra\u2019s governmental structure. Repealing outdated legislation, removing inadequate officers and replacing them with new ones, and generally tweaking things to suit my taste. The previous Lord, Lord Ildesias, he didn\u2019t delegate very many matters, leaving Isra largely without commanding officers presiding over the major departments of government, the various lieutenants instead reporting directly to him, the Lord. I find such structuring to be highly inefficient, and lack the patience to micromanage each and every sargent. He found the arrangement to be tiring to the point of forcing his retirement. As such, there are a great number of positions with Isra\u2019s government that I am seeking to either fill, replace, or create.\u201dShe tilts her head to the side to consider one of the many papers on the desk, this one in particular containing an overall listing of the matters she intends to attend to today. Among them, a listing of a handful of high authority positions are listed, in the context of beginning to search for individuals to fill them. After taking a moment to peruse the list, she returns her gaze upward to levy another appraising look at Ryden. \u201cWith that said, what manner of services are yours to offer? What manner of position are you looking to be appointed to, and what manner of experience do you have that would qualify you for such a position?\u201d", "1462187398000": "After listening to the extent of Ryden\u2019s statement, Naoki nods, and returns her focus to the list. It seems as if her age-old problem had not seen it fit to leave her during the transition. People seeking to be employed still don\u2019t know what they\u2019d like to do. Would it kill them to come in with a plan? A solid idea of what field they\u2019d like to work in? Just once, even. Though. She supposes, a great deal of success could be indirectly attributed to her ability to place individuals in positions that suit them. She probably shouldn\u2019t be quite so irritated at one more- seemingly skilled employee-to-be. It allows her to- as he stated, make a more educated decision about where Ryden would best be suited. However, it\u2019s still yet another major decision to be made today, one more for the heap. \u201cHm.\u201dShe glances up at the bearded man sitting across the desk, and back down to the list. It\u2019s rather untidy, as lists go, covered with small notes, alterations, crossed out terms, and corrections. However, this untiness is no product of Naoki\u2019s own script, but rather a side effect of the list being so exhaustive, and having been iterated upon many times over the course of the last few days. A few portions of the document are unobscured and legible enough to be read. In her dancing script, they read as follows. (In no particular order.)Fire WallaceEnclave check-inRe-attempt negotiation with GoraiaJustice Department \u2605Contract warding expertAssess status and inhabitants of dungeon\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Find a term less archaic than \u2018dungeon\u2019 to usePromote LizHave lamps moved into officeSpeak with Indil and Alden about appointment when they return \u2605 Also JunEnsure Citadel accommodations and security are suitable \u2605Dinner with Takhana \u2605Locate suitable secretary\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Also new TreasurerSpeak with CyroninHave someone investigate rose emblemsThe list continues further, but there is only so much one can read, upside down and inconspicuously. Again considering both the list and the man that sit before her, Naoki figures it best to give Ryden an inquiry to respond to. With a larger sample size, and by extension, a deeper understanding of his character, Naoki thinks that she may be able to more accurately place him. \u201cRiddle me this, Sir Greyiron. You\u2019re evidently a recent arrival to Isra. I would have heard of you by now if you were not. How recent of an arrival are you, and how much do you know of Isra, its history, its culture, policies, and other such related topics?\u201d", "1462191967000": "\u201cHm. Well, I\u2019ve not the time to impart upon you the full history of Isra or the detail of its policies, but you should understand at least this abbreviated version.\u201d\u201cIsra, at the time, only called \u201cThe Free City\u201d, was founded roughly five years ago in this plain. It was founded by a mixed group of deposed leaders, merchants, soldiers, and other associated citizenry from all walks of life who were seeking a superior and more free life than they had been allowed in whatever land they had come from. I was among them, a hanger- on, without any particular significance.\u201dMadame Naoki selects from the items on her desk the quill that she had evidently been using earlier, the ink on the tip having dried by now. Between two of the fingers on her left hand, she begins to spin the quill about, causing the feathered end to bob rhythmically with the tempo of her speech. \u201cIn the years since, the city was named, Isra, and has grown into the highly populated and prosperous city we stand in today. Since its conception, Isra\u2019s primary governing body has been an Assembly, of one hundred Ministers. The current total is somewhat smaller- only eighty-three. Ministers are chosen by a combination of public elections, appointment by officials, and conscription by the Assembly itself in a complicated set of rules and ratios that I can\u2019t be bothered to explain right now. Regardless, it is through this democratic body of The Assembly that all major decisions must be made. My station as Lady only allows me a limited degree of direct authority over the high level administrative decisions of Isa. However, discluding the largest of matters, such as war, major changes to the governmental structure or laws, I am able to make mostly unilateral decisions, though they may be repealed or anger the Assembly later.\u201d\u201cAs far as policies go, Isra\u2019s focus so far has been most closely aligned with the concepts of freedom, libertarianism... tolerance, neutrality\u2026\u201d She counts on her fingers as she lists the concepts. \u201cAnd free trade, I suppose. There\u2019s more to be said about the nuances of each concept and how it is applied literally, but again\u2026\u201d Naoki gestures to the list, implying that she still has just as many things to do as when they started this conversation. \u201cOne of the concepts that hasn\u2019t yet been emphasized, however, is security. I\u2019m not sure how much time you spent observing the streets on your way in, or the roads on your travels, but there are far more threats to Isra and its people about than I would really prefer. Criminals, bandits, monsters, debatably hostile bordering nations, spies, the list goes on. On and on, longer than it really should be. And, to be fair, the city guard does an admirable job of keeping the worst sorts out, monitoring the road, and protecting merchants, but not as thorough a job as I would like. Our military is adequate enough that I don\u2019t actively fear large scale invasion or anything of that sort, but it is sometimes the death-by-a-thousand-cuts, or the issues that eat a nation from the inside out that are the most deadly. The sorts of things I can\u2019t sic a platoon of griffin cavalry on to make them go away.\u201d\u201cAs such, I\u2019m looking to find individuals to be part of a new department of the government. One primarily concerned with defense of the interior, criminal justice, oversight of other departments, and other similar sorts of tasks. A department to ensure that I can focus on the external affairs, rather than the internal threats. Based on what you\u2019ve said so far, I\u2019m inclined to consider you for possible involvement with such a department.\u201dThoroughly tired of sitting so rigidly upright, Madame Naoki reclines into the depths of her seat, leaning down into the cushioning and continuing to twirl the quill in one hand. \u201cSo let me ask you another question. Or rather, ask you for a definition. In your own words, as many as you\u2019d care to use, tell me what the word \u2018justice\u2019 means to you.\u201d", "1462199541000": "Again, Madame Naoki nods thoughtfully, considering his statement fully before responding. \u201cHm. Well, to be honest with you, I\u2019m looking for neither of those things. Rather, simply an individual who can be given a handful of open ended directives, such as \u201cguard the border\u201d, \u201cuphold the laws\u201d, \u201cprevent crime\u201d, and \u201croot out corruption\u201d, and fulfill those directives in a manner that I find suitable, independent of any specious moral concepts. My singular concern is that the job be done well, to the satisfaction of all involved. I have little patience for what is \u201cright\u201d or \u201cwrong\u201d in a moral sense,\u201cgood\u201d or \u201cevil\u201d. The only concept that manners to me in this circumstance is the security of the people who have chosen me to lead them. An individual ought to be able to sleep soundly in Isra, and not feel threatened as they walk its streets. While I do not entertain the unattainable notion of completely eliminating the concept of crime, I think that I am rightly displeased with the frequency and regularity with which it occurs in Isra, and I believe that by putting a larger emphasis on security, overall quality of life will improve.\u201d\u201cWhich is the great underlying goal, of course.\u201d\u201cI asked the question primarily to see if you would go on an hour long rant about morality and ethics and the role of the government in the lives of its people. Seeing as how you did not, that\u2019s good enough for me. I\u2019m not looking to appoint a philosopher; I\u2019m looking to appoint a leader and a lawman. Which is, conveniently enough, what you would seem to be.\u201dAs she concludes that statement, Naoki sits back up, and manages to extract a blank bit of parchment from the piles. Placing it squarely before her, she shifts the quill to her other hand, dips it into a bottle of ink obscured somewhere among the mess, and begins to write. \u201cI won\u2019t inquire further into your past or the circumstances that brought you here today. I\u2019m willing to give you the benefit of the doubt, and offer you an appointment of some sort within this new department of government we\u2019re forming. There will be hoops to leap through, an Assembly meeting, and mounds of paperwork to legitimize the whole affair, but you\u2019ll have a position in the end, assuming everything goes as I will it to, and you don\u2019t turn out to be some elaborate sort of spy or deceiver. In the intervening time\u2026\u201dPlacing the quill back down on the desk, she reaches next with her right hand to her left, placing index and thumb around her left fourth finger. However, there\u2019s nothing there to grasp at; simply a light crease suggesting a ring was once worn there.The habit of authenticating documents with a stamp of her signet ring is a habit that isn\u2019t so easily broken, it seems. And, until her new ring is finished, one that she won\u2019t be able to practice. Though she supposes that she could technically send for a traditional stamp bearing Isra\u2019s insignia, she cannot be bothered to do so, instead opting to simply sign the document with another flourish of the quill, before placing it on the desk before Ryden. \u201cTake this. It is a document that establishes you as a guest of mine, and authorizes you to peruse the fortifications and other security installations of Isra at your leisure, discluding access to the most sensitive areas. With this in hand, guards should allow you to observe their work, and answer any reasonable inquiries you might direct their way. I suggest, over the next week or so, that you spend your time touring Isra. To properly oversee a city, you must first know the city. However otherwise qualified you may be to hold such a position, you lack the primary qualification: knowledge of your domain. Take a few days, walk around, familiarize yourself with the city, its people, the going\u2019s on, all of that. Attempt to locate any areas of security that require immediate attention, and begin to formulate plans regarding what sorts of policies or alterations to the structure of Isra\u2019s defenses may be in order. You could even consider preparing a formal report on the topic.\u201d\u201cWhile you\u2019re doing that, I will handle things on this end to establish the department you\u2019re going to be appointed to, and work out the kinks in how it will all function. In perhaps a week or so, depending on how quickly the Assembly functions, I will be prepared to offer you a position formally.\u201d\u201cWith all of that said, do you have any questions, or do you need anything from me to complete that task? Funds, lodging, new attire, any of that?\u201d", "1462272142000": "Yet again, Madame Naoki listens, and nods, taking the offered hand and shaking it. Her grip is firm- firmer than one might expect, but warm, as everything in the room tends to be.\u00a0As if on cue, the sun decides that it is high time to be high, and aligns with Isra\u2019s sun insignia on the window stretching up behind Naoki\u2019s seat. The resultant rays of light begin to cast a matching sun insignia on the checkered floor, signaling mid-day. \u201cVery well. That all sounds like a good way to get started. Depending on your station- and it\u2019s beginning to seem like you\u2019re going to be heading this venture- you\u2019ll probably end up with a seat on the Assembly. High ranking officials tend to. It\u2019s not as if the Assembly is full and someone else would need to resign. As for the funds and board\u2026\u201dOnce again, she dives into the perilous piles of paperwork that lie stacked upon her desk, before emerging victoriously with a small bit of parchment about as large as the palm of her hand. After checking the card front and back to ensure that it doesn\u2019t have anything of great secrecy notated upon it, she rises from her own seat and places it on the far side of the desk for Ryden to take. \u201cVisit this establishment. I\u2019ll see to it that they provide you what you need. My channels here in The Citadel haven\u2019t yet been established;  the only bed within these walls that I could offer you is my own, and it\u2019s a little bit early for that sort of thing anyway.\u201d She inclines her head in the direction of the insignia creeping its way across the floor.\u00a0", "1462409922000": "Madame Naoki nods as Ryden exists, satisfied. Another seemingly competent agent come seeking to be placed into her service. It\u2019s pleasing to see that that particular trend hasn\u2019t disappeared with the transition. The matter seemingly handled for now, Naoki returns to the task she was working on before Ryden\u2019s entry. Which was\u2026 what. Dammit. Having lost track, Naoki selects something from the top of the pile and begins to apply herself to figuring out just what exactly needs to be done and doing it. As she does so, the purple gemstone embedded into her ear begins to glow with an ever-increasing intensity. At first, she continues to write, but soon places the quill down to lean back in her chair and divert the entirety of her attention to the telepathic communications. Whatever is going on is evidently somewhat troubling, as her eyebrows draw closer together and her mouth forms into a thin line. After perhaps a minute of this, she sits back up, locates a blank piece of parchment, and begins to write again, in slow, careful strokes. ", "1462419353000": "Madame Naoki glances up from her work to see Ryden approaching again, but returns her gaze downward as he begins to speak, still scribbling away at the parchment on the desk. The attentive posture of her ears gives indication, however, that she is not ignoring him, and once he\u2019s finished, she nods slowly, still concentrating on the document. \u201cI\u2019m aware, yes. Well, I should clarify - I\u2019m aware of the situation in the plaza, but not the extent of the corruption within our ranks. I\u2019ve already gone ahead and declared a low level state of emergency. The majority of Ministers are asleep, and this is a matter that needs to be dealt with only with the highest level of expediency. I\u2019ll have no trouble justifying this tomorrow. To that end, however\u2026\u201dWith a small flourish, she signs her name to the document, and slides it across the desk to Ryden. \u201cThat document is a direct order that removes the current head of the guard from power. This sort of thing was  his responsibility to prevent, and his complete failure to do so makes him unfit to hold his post.\u201dWith another application of her signature, Naoki completes a second document, and places it atop the first. \u201cThis document grants you emergency authority to temporarily take command of the guard. Not the military, mind you, just the city guard. Unfortunately enough, the majority of my trusted commanders are out of the city and therefore unable to assist, so it looks like you\u2019ll be getting your position a bit sooner than we initially anticipated.\u201dWith that document finished and presented, Madame Naoki returns her quill to its holder and takes a deep, sighing breath. She was aware that Isra\u2019s guard wasn\u2019t quite the group of shining paragons that she would have liked them to be, but this level of corruption is far in excess of both her expectations and what she is willing to tolerate. Admittedly, Ryden\u2019s waiver did not actually compel the guards to comply with his orders, but to blatantly ignore her signature is inexcusable. After composing herself, she stands in a slow, deliberate motion, leaving one palm spread on the desk. The expression on her face is not one of anger or rage, simply cold, quiet displeasure. \u201cAnd this is me standing up to deal with the situation personally. If the guards will not respect my signature, they will be made to respect the underside of my boot. Take those documents and follow me. It\u2019s time to send a message.\u201dWith that somewhat ominous statement made, Madame Naoki takes a moment to collect a few belongings from the desk, place them into the pockets of her trousers, and strides from the room, knowing Artemis will be right behind her and expecting Ryden to follow. On the way out, she also beckons to a pair of The Citadel\u2019s honor guard, instructing them too, to fall in line behind her. ", "1462701359000": "Rather than waiting to receive a response from within, the guards flanking the doorway simply push the doors inward, in a more synchronous manner than their last attempt. They were instructed to expect Lieutenant Finch\u2019s arrival, and allow her entry immediately upon verifying her identity. At her desk at the far end of the room, Madame Naoki looks up as the doors open, and, upon recognizing her latest visitors, raises a hand in greeting to the pair. \u201cElizabeth! Welcome back. I see you\u2019ve brought a friend. Come, have a seat.\u201d She gestures to the pair of guest chairs sitting before the desk, and rises from her seat, extending her hnad across the desk- presumably to be shaken.", "1462724144000": "Madame Naoki\u2019s gaze bounces back and forth between the pair of them. She had sort of been expecting one or the other to say something. Perhaps for the dwarf to introduce himself, or for Liz to begin her report. But fair enough. She can work with less than that. Leaning over the desk slightly, she takes Dardan\u2019s hand in her own, and gives it a quick shake. Her grip is firmer than one might expect, but warm. Though, it probably isn\u2019t particularly hard to keep one\u2019s hands warm in her office- the whole room is ten degrees warmer than the hallway outside. Figuring it best not to prolong the awkwardness, she doesn\u2019t spend any longer than is necessary on the handshake, and returns to her seat. Seeing as how Liz hasn\u2019t performed introductions, she figures it best to go ahead and do them herself. \u201cI am Madame Naoki, Lady of Isra. This is my companion, Artemis.\" She gestures to her right, indicating @artemisbefore continuing, \"Allow me to welcome you to Isra. It\u2019s a pleasure to make your acquaintance\u2026?\u201d", "1462806158000": "Madame Naoki listens carefully as Dardan speaks, but what she finds far more interesting than his words, are his drawings. Not only is she usually one for the written words and the value and knowledge and all that nonsense, his works exceptional. Charcoal is quite the medium, she muses. After taking a short while to appreciate each bit of parchment, she focuses on the most practical of the lot- the map. \u201cHm. To the south, on the coast. Right in the middle of that terribly dangerous forest. As I recall, during Isra\u2019s initial map making, cartographers were sent into there. But when the majority of them didn\u2019t return, and the ones that did came not with completed maps, but stories of the horrors of the forest, the entire area was written off as incredibly dangerous, and of little note beyond its inherent perils. Lumber was obtained from elsewhere, and we never presumed that anyone of note would be living within- especially not such an apparently strong civilization such as yours. In hindsight, we probably should have scouted it aerially before now, but what\u2019s done is done, I suppose.\u201d\u201cRegardless, it\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, Dardan Wavebrand. I look forward to getting to know you and your people more thoroughly in the days ahead. To that end, do you have any suggestions? I would like to suggest that Dolburimm and Isra open more formal diplomatic relations, but wouldn\u2019t like to seem overly forward about it. Are you qualified to speak officially as an ambassador, or would you suggest some manner of meeting, or?...\u201dAfter she\u2019s said that, Naoki realizes, that probably wasn\u2019t the best question to ask. If what she has been told is true, this is the people of Dolburimm\u2019s first interaction with a foreign power. There would be no reason for them to have standardized procedures. Heck, he might not even know the word \u2018Ambassador\u2019. Regardless, she figures it best to let her statement stand. What she was told may be wrong, and it would be awkward to correct at this point. If he seemed unsure, she would suggest procedures, she resolves. Additionally, she appends a small, telepathic note to Elizabeth, \"Don't worry about it, and continue to call me what you'd like. I'm somewhat irreversibly associated with the title 'Madame' at this point, don't worry too much about the formalities when they're unnecessary.\"", "1462894283000": "At the mention of a feast, Madame Naoki\u2019s face lights up.

I\u2019m not sure when, or where, or what will be served, but a feast will happen. And going forward, more feasts will be held. I wonder if it would be reasonable to construct a hall specifically for holding feasts in\u2026\u201dShe trails off, likely considering feast-related logistics and procedures before snapping back into the present and considering Dardan\u2019s inquiry with a raised eyebrow. \u201cWe don\u2019t lose many individuals at all in the logging industry. The majority of Isra\u2019s lumber comes from the forests to the north, around the feet of the Norkari Mountains, and to the east, bordering the Land Tiller\u2019s State. Neither forest is particularly dangerous, if all proper caution is given. A couple wolves or a troll here and there to the north, occasionally a wyvern to the east, but nothing so extreme that I would say that lumber is dangerous to acquire. .. I would presume that the same is not true around Dolburimm. I\u2019m unfamiliar with \u2018Tormand\u2019, but it would stand to my reasoning that the forest that would seem to surround Dolburimm is no more friendly to your people than it was to our explorers\u2026 Would I be thinking correctly; could you elaborate?\u201d", "1463071482000": "Dardan\u2019s response elicits a somber sort of \u201cHm.\u201d from Madame Naoki. A highly interesting bit of information, that. She takes what he says at face value. There are strange things afoot than \u2018spirits of the dead\u2019 haunting a forest. Whether the stated mythos regarding their presence is true or not is essentially irrelevant to her, the important parts as far as she\u2019s concerned are chiefly the spirituality of the Dolburese people, the (admittedly quite vague) details regarding their forest, and the insane markup Naoki will be able to sell them lumber for. \u201cWell, fair enough, I suppose. Lumber is definitely an export that could be arranged, if all goes well, your people shouldn\u2019t be forced to venture into Tormand\u2019s Wood quite as much. Or, at least, you\u2019ll have a supplementary source of lumber from imports. I would assume that Dolburrim would be willing to offer various products of the sea and perhaps shipbuilding knowledge in return, and that all about sounds fine and agreeable to me.\u201d\u201cHave you- or your council of Thanes, or however, have you put any thought into how you might like to approach- or not approach the rest of the world? There are other nations around. To the east, Land Tillers' State . They\u2019re a pleasant sort, in my opinion. Very in tune with the land, and nature, and all that. Their farming methods are very good. There are also some other nations, I suppose. None of them quite as pleasant, in my opinion, but worth considering, if only in the context of forming a political strategy. \u2026 Though, I suppose such things may be more appropriately discussed with your brother, or the group of Thanes as a whole\u2026\u201dShe trails off, again likely thinking ahead. However, only a few moments are spent contemplating the future before she snaps back and again addresses Dardan.\u201cWell, that seems like a plan enough for me.

A pleasure to meet you.\u201dMadame Naoki\u2019s desk is uncharacteristically clean. Aside from an in/outbox piled high with assorted documents, a stack of blank parchment, her writing supplies, and a beautiful rose held in a small vase, the desk is utterly empty. Spotless, even. The dark wood shines slightly, reflecting light from the towering window behind her. The Lady herself is dressed equally simply, in a one piece black dress with lacy ornamentation down the sides. Her tail is held at an upward curve to the left, and a pleasant sort of polite smile graces her face. Her information on Lord Crovan is somewhat lacking.

I\u2019m afraid that I\u2019ve not heard much of you, Lord Crovan. You have a settlement to the north east, as I understand?...\u201dShe trails off, expecting Crovan to go into some level of detail about what exactly he\u2019s lord of before getting on with what he has to say. ", "1465001458000": "Noaki listens and nods slowly as Crovan speaks his bit. Idly, she laments how there aren\u2019t quite enough words to accurately describe her position as it relates to his. \u201cLord Crovan\u201d sounds more prestigious than \u201cLady Naoki\u201d without any context, simply due to gender bias and such. It isn\u2019t as if she can use the word \u201cQueen\u201d either, because Isra isn\u2019t any sort of backwards, outdated monarchy. There isn\u2019t a word to describe a democratically elected female leader of a significant nation, and that irks her. Maybe she could see about adopting a new word. Or perhaps increasing the size of her holdings. When Crovan delivers his proposal, however, Naoki is caught somewhat off-guard. Her eyebrows raise, and her mouth forms a small \u2018o\u2019. Interesting. She nods thoughtfully, mulling the matter over before continuing. \u201cAn interesting proposition, and assuming that no extraneous circumstances are at play, one that I would be very willing to take you up on. Tell me a bit more about your lands\u2026 \u2018The Winterlands\u2019. I\u2019m going to have to present this to The Assembly for approval, and it would do me well to know a bit about them before then.

With curious motion of her other hand, a quill is procured seemingly from thin air, and she begins to write as she continues speaking. \u201cI figure, we do it like this. After we\u2019re finished here, we\u2019ll definitively define The Winterlands on a map, based primarily on where you consider them to be. Those lands will be added officially to Isra\u2019s territory, and you will be installed to lead them. All of this, by the way, this will be mounds of paperwork. Mostly for me, but to install you as a regional governor, you\u2019re going to have to go through the standard government employee registration process.\u201dThe quill dances across the page almost as quickly as she speaks, making notes of what all she will have to do to make the plan she\u2019s proposing into reality. \u201cThat will give you a seat on The Assembly, which you could choose to attend in person or send a representative to sit in your place. It is a bit of a trek, after all\u2026 Which is why we\u2019ll build a road! It shouldn\u2019t be too much trouble to extend a fork of the eastern road up to Castle Winter. I obviously have no idea, but that seems like it would be prudent. We\u2019ll look into it later.\u201d\u201cAfter that, I can send a garrison over there for you, and see to it that your holdings are kept in good shape. For as excellent a strategic position as it is, and as brave as your men are, I don\u2019t quite think that one hundred men are enough to mount a successful defense should Isra be invaded by a force large enough to threaten it. To this end, I will deploy one of my personal agents to accompany you back and see that you\u2019re set up properly. They\u2019ll oversee the placement of the garrison, any renovations that need to be made to your castle, the opening of the mines, and all of that.

I have one desire: to be your personal bodyguard.\"Madame Naoki is taken somewhat aback as her hand is kissed, but rolls with it. What truly perplexes her is his request. That\u2019s a\u2026 unique reason to travel to Isra. After hesitating for a moment, she responds, \u201cWell\u2026 It\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, but I must ask. Why? We\u2019ve only just met. Why travel to Isra to become my bodyguard when you have no idea what sort of person I am? Are you a high profile bodyguard by trade?\u201d", "1465255050000": "Naoki nods thoughtfully as Aradlur speaks and Artemis relays her thoughts telepathically. Artemis, as she tends to, makes an excellent point. There are many individuals who are considerably more qualified to be personally responsible for her security, the most qualified of whom remains standing to her right. After thinking for a moment to select the right words, Naoki responds to Aradlur in a carefully measured tone.\u201cWell. As flattered as I am, I\u2019m afraid I must decline your offer. Having been a prominent businesswoman before ascending to Head of State, here, I find my security needs already amply provided for. I would be happy to accept your services in another way. My Sun Marshals are always appreciative of skilled individuals, and the Judiciary Department is in constant search of properly qualified individuals, but the prospect of becoming my personal bodyguard is not on the table.\u201d", "1465432416000": "Madame Naoki watches as Araldur abruptly leaves. After the doors swing shut behind him, she sits quietly for a moment, somewhat confused. Who was that? They didn\u2019t even give their name. An assassin, perhaps? Pretty awful assassin, if that was the case. Did he really expect her to accept his service without question?\u201c...

Information doesn\u2019t flow as freely as all that in those parts of the world, so this is the first she\u2019s hearing of it. She nods in acknowledgement. The Brotherhood could have met with a far worse fate, after all. As he continues, her eyebrows raise in surprise. Like Crovan\u2019s hand-kissing, this is the first occasion on which an individual has kneeled before her. (Outside of the bedroom, that is.) The second thing that comes to mind is the uncleanliness of the floor. That bit of the floor, those tiles right before her desk, haven\u2019t been cleaned in a few days. And goodness knows how many boots have been there, and where they\u2019ve been. That\u2019s not to say that the floor is\u2026 unclean, but\u2026 If this becomes a trend, she\u2019ll have to get a small cushion or something, Naoki resolves.Regardless, she addresses the matter at hand, putting on her most dignified tone of voice to address Adrian von Heschburg , \u201cI would be honored to accept your service, Sir Adrian. Reseat yourself.\u201dAfter waiting a moment for him to rise and retake his seat, Naoki continues, \u201cThere are too many in this world that seek to bring harm to others, and too many that rely on others entirely for their protection from the first group. I will gladly accept your assistance, of a man I\u2019ve heard to be well-versed in the ways of war, in protecting the people of Isra from those would see it fit to do them harm.

Do you have any more specific preferences or unprofessed areas of expertise that you\u2019d like to articulate now, or would you rather I simply place you where you are most needed within Isra\u2019s army?\u201dAs something of an afterthought, she adds, \u201cThough, if you\u2019d prefer a decidedly less exciting line of work, perhaps some manner of public office or other civil appointment, that\u2019s perfectly acceptable as far as I\u2019m concerned.

Keep things relatively versatile, is all.\u201d\u201cTo accomplish this goal, do whatever is necessary. File for transfers, request funds, have new training ground built, recruit new men from elsewhere, whatever needs to be done. I\u2019ll see to it that your requests are approved and the bureaucratic side of things is expedited to enable you. Keep me up to date on your progress, and I would appreciate being told your end goal before you begin, but do you have any questions so far?\u201dApparently finished with the document, Naoki turns her gaze upward to consider Adrian with golden eyes.", "1466263887000": "\u201cHold on just a moment...\u201dAfter spending just a moment to scan her newly completed document for errors, Madame Naoki signs her signature to the bottom of the document with a quick flourish of her quill, rolls it shut, and stamps it with a wax seal.

On this rather unremarkable day, she is wearing an off-shoulder white blouse with bell sleeves, and presumably some manner of lower garment, though it isn\u2019t visible through the desk. As the doors open and Jean enters, she glances up from whatever manner of document she would seem to be reading, and nods slightly to acknowledge his presence before gesturing to the guest chairs, inviting him to seat himself. As he presumably does so, she concludes reviewing the parchment, and sets it off to one side. For a moment, she simply considers him,. An interesting sort of thing, he is. Halflings tend to be, she supposes. Idly, she wonders if the sideburns technically count as a racial feature in the same way the pointed ears do.

Wise of him, she muses. She pauses for a moment before continuing, \u201cAnd, aspirations aside, what manner of qualifications do you have? There are lots of farmers in Isra, and it would be foolish of me to appoint any old stable boy with a silver tongue to such a position. Do you have any formal education, or any prior experience in the field beyond owning a farm? You\u2019ve only just been elected to the Assembly, and have yet to prove yourself as a member of the government. I don\u2019t know of your abilities or proficiencies.

Why should you be appointed, instead of any other candidate?\"", "1468444839000": "The third option, of course, is that Naoki is fully aware of Jean and his activities, and only asked to hear it from his mouth. There\u2019s always a difference between what the files say and what the subject says. Discrepancies. Phrasing. Omitted portions. Hearing about someone describe their own accomplishments is telling about the individual in more ways than one. And, Naoki thinks, if she\u2019s about to appoint Jean to manage Isra\u2019s industries, she had better know him pretty well. Following his explanations, she nods. More of the same powerful words and sumptuous-sounding plans, but this time he\u2019s made a case for himself. Naoki had been part of that initial demand on the Plains\u2019 farms. The Midnight Sun has- and still does, even, demand a rather significant quantity of goods from the farms around Isra. As of late, more and more of that demand has been met by foreign imports, granted, but Jean\u2019s wagon trains most probably played a part. Naoki may have even negotiated with some of Jean\u2019s fellows, though she doesn\u2019t recall meeting the half-man himself before. She also notes how Jean has conveniently skipped over any mention of formal education. Of which at least some is necessary to fulfill the position, she notes. \u201cAlright, Lait. You make a solid case for yourself. However, I see one issue. Politics work is- and take this from me, far more than simply contacts, a nice-sounding plan, and \u201cunique charm\u201d. If it were not, I wouldn\u2019t need anyone to help.\u201dHere, she inserts a smirk. \u201cCharm\u201d is something she has in spades.However, it fades quickly, and she continues, \u201cThose things are important, don\u2019t misunderstand me, but there\u2019s a bit more. Notably, being able to work as part of a larger team- in your case, The Conclave, and the nitty-gritty work of reading documents, filing paperwork, and that sort of thing.\u201d\u201cBefore I consider offering you an appointment, I need to know that you\u2019ll be willing to work as part of the team even if your own individual vision does not agree with the vision of the team. Or my own, or those of the Chancellor, or the popular vote, or whatever else the overriding case may be. And also that you\u2019ll be willing to learn the proper ways to do your paperwork and such. There\u2019s a surprising amount to it, I\u2019ve found.\u201d\u201cAssuming you find yourself willing to do those two things, and barring any as of yet unseen issues or complications- (if you turn out to be a massive addict or a foreign spy or something like that,) I would be willing to offer you the portfolio.\u201dWith that said, she leans back in her seat, arms folded, eyeing him to gauge his response.

Perhaps it would be easiest to knock him off now, and spare the frustration later. She considers the notion, but decides against it for the time being. Perhaps later. For now, some new policies are in order.

A pleasure to see you both.\u201dAs the two come forward and seat themselves, she shifts slightly in her seat, intending to disguise how intently she\u2019s observing the pair of them. Their body language says a lot, in this instance. Crovan, for his part, seems to be keeping things mostly cool so far. Nothing terribly readable yet. Liz, on the other hand, seems to be highly uncomfortable with something. Walking as if she\u2019s cradling an insertion of some sort, and is doing her best to hide it, and blushing furiously. That would be pretty hot, Naoki muses to herself in an entirely private though, but highly unlikely. It\u2019s more probable that she\u2019s uncomfortable in some way. With this in mind, Naoki resolves not to give any too lecherous looks, and ask her about it later, if it persists. \u201cWell, with the aid of our scryer, I was watching over your metaphorical shoulder, so I\u2019m aware of the basic details, and you two will be expected to present a full report at tomorrow\u2019s conclave meeting anyway, so the short version if you would be so kind, along with anything that can\u2019t be said before the whole Conclave.\u201dMoving one hand up to rest her chin in her palm, Naoki awaits one or other of them to continue, and deliver a truncated version of their report.

By all accounts, the little excursion proved uneventful. She didn\u2019t expect it to be. The only interesting bit of information to be had is such that Goraia seems to intend to send and receive diplomats. One of the next things Naoki would need to do is find someone to send over there, but there doesn\u2019t seem to be anything much else to say about the matter at hand. Silently, Naoki notes Liz\u2019 continued flushing, and considers attempting to steer today in another direction. \u201cThat\u2019s fine enough news. I\u2019m sure it was good experience for the soldiers.\u201d In a seemingly seamless segue, she continues, \u201cWhat do the two of you have planned for the rest of today?

Naoki's eyebrows rise in a combination of surprise and amusement. She was gearing up to take the lead, but it seems as if Liz has already consciously accepted what she wants, and is moving to obtain it herself. A silent round of metaphorical applause for her, Naoki muses. Fair enough, though. If Liz intends to be so selfish handle it herself, then so be it. Naoki will adopt a supportive role, \u201cAlternatively or additionally, if you two would like to stop back here, perhaps after dinner, I\u2019ve not had a good chance to socialize with you yet, Lord Crovan. And I think I might like to.\u201dThere\u2019s a certain edge to her tone. One that states plainly that she hasn\u2019t chosen to use all of the words she could, but not so much of an edge as to make one feel uncomfortable.

So you two go ahead, and meet me back here- actually, up in the tower, once you\u2019ve stuffed yourselves. I\u2019d hate to be left out of anything fun.\u201d Despite her apparent fatigue, Naoki seems to do an admirable job of making her subtext clear, adding a slightly more openly lecherous smirk, and fixing the pair of them with an appraising sort of glare, as if planning ahead.That ought to add a fun subtext to their dinner, Naoki thinks. It would be interesting to see how the pair of them individually bear Naoki\u2019s intentions in mind through the meal.

But still, her response is satisfactory, and Naoki response, \u201cOther than the aforementioned nap and perhaps a stiff drink?\u201dNaoki shrugs. \u201cNo, not particularly. You\u2019re finished with the report, and there\u2019s not much more to discuss unless either of you have a topic. You two go ahead.

Idly, she wonders how things would have progressed- if at all, between them without her intervention. After considering for a moment,  she decides that it would be much quicker, and very-much-more fun this way. (Especially for her.) In a morbid turn, Naoki reflects that we all only have so much time to spend, and there\u2019s no sense in wasting it with overly complicated and unnecessary courting processes. A bit of a jump start would be appreciated later, more likely than not. And, reflecting further, she really ought to be doing the same thing. \"Soon,\" she resolves, for what seems like the hundredth time. Regardless, it\u2019s nap time, not introspection time.

Sitting her, in her guest seat, a member of a long lost and forgotten species, essentially demanding that all of Isra get up and leave because they\u2019d like to move back in. You know, actually. Thinking about it, this is a problem. If this little guy is legit, with an appropriately sized ego, this is a massive issue! Goodness. One that should be prepared for. Silently, without fanfare or visible indication, Naoki begins to reach out, issuing hundreds of preparatory orders in parallel. As she does so, she responds verbally to Demosthenes, \u201cWell. I personally was not involved in the construction of Isra, but I\u2019ll take your word for it.\u201dIn reality, she had conferred with Grandma once before on the topic. At the time, it was simply something interesting to be aware of, but then again, here it is, sitting in front of her desk.\u201cAnd then, what all would you like Isra to do?

She eyes Adrian with a look that- while it isn\u2019t overly hostile, is most definitely displeased. Hansel isn't given more than a glance's worth of acknowledgement. One would also note the robed figure of Grandma, standing to Naoki\u2019s right. \u201cSo. What of the fortress, and the legion I granted to you stationed within it?\u201d Tilting her head slightly, she prompts Adrian for a response.

Each clause, each sentence she speaks is punctuated with an emphatic movement of her arms and hands as she continues, \u201cI\u2019m giving you those things so that you might lead the legion to be a functioning component of Isra\u2019s military defense, and keep our northwestern border locked down.\u201dRising from her seat, Lady Naoki doesn\u2019t strike a terribly intimidating figure. Five feet, nine inches worth of plushy, sweater-covered curves.

Here I am, sitting here under the illusion that you were doing what I expected! I thought that our northwestern border was fine, but no! It\u2019s apparently been largely unguarded this entire time. With a little note that would have taken you five minutes to write and a silver piece to have delivered to me, I could have sent someone competent to do what I thought you were doing this entire time.\u201dReseating herself, Naoki takes a moment to visibly reestablish her decorum. After she does, she looks silently across the desk at the pair of them and considers for the space of a few moments what she ought to do with them. After she seems to have reached a conclusion, Naoki\u2019s earring glimmers for a moment more before she nods and speaks to Adrian, her tone not leaving much room to argue, \u201cHere\u2019s what you\u2019re going to do: after we\u2019re finished speaking, you are going to be escorted to The Citadel\u2019s infirmary, and they are going to treat you. Afterward, Grandma here will accompany and assist you in further investigating the red magic, and in finding your lost comrades. After that has been concluded in some manner or another, you will return here.\u201dWith one finger, she points downward, intending to imply that Adrian should return to this very office once he\u2019s finished.

Claiming to have had things fully under control and then continuing on in the next sentence to say that he was literally in a trance and completely beholden to the will of this silly \u2018Voice\u2019 he kept going on about strikes Naoki as less than sensical and not at all reassuring. As such Naoki scoffs her mightiest scoff of disgust, before continuing in her own voice, \u201cAnd what if it didn\u2019t. What then, Adrian. Who would have had to deal with the consequences then?\u201dGrumbling to herself, Naoki\u2019s earring glimmers as she reaches out to Takhana Veil, and requests to have special surveillance placed on Adrian and any of his Brother comrades, and asks to be informed of their activities periodically.

At the squeal, however, and the pattering of small feet, Naoki not only raises her head, but places down her quill, and preemptively slides her chair back to accommodate the child that so rapidly scampers her way up into her lap. Placing one hand on Little Naoki\u2019s lower back and the other on the backside of her head, Naoki doesn\u2019t seem particularly bothered, only pleased and perhaps mildly surprised. Beginning to stroke the back of the girl\u2019s head and in the process, scratch behind her ears, Naoki address her namesake- again in much the same tone she would use when addressing an adult, not choosing to increase her pitch for the child\u2019s benefit, \u201cI did; it\u2019s good to see you. How are you, what have you been up to?\u201dSimultaneously, Naoki acknowledges Alden with another small wave and a nod in his direction. Part of her is curious to see what all he\u2019d like to talk about, he having scheduled the meeting but not elaborating much on the topic, and having brought his daughter.

They apply to all the rest.\u201dFor a moment, Naoki considers leaning forward to draw attention to one of the papers on her desk. Among them, there are plenty of fun examples of applied mathematics. Finance papers and such. But at the same time, Naoki is comfortable, and it seems like Little Naoki is as well, nestled there in her pillows. So Naoki remains as she is, leaning further back into the chair. \u201cI\u2019ll look forward to it,\u201d Naoki murmurs in response. \u201cHave you come across anything you haven\u2019t been able to understand yet?\u201d", "1475209879000": "Nodding in regards to the trigonometry comments, Naoki finds herself forced to agree. The geometric mathematics didn\u2019t quite agree with her in the same manner that the purely numerical sorts tended to early on. Continuing to nod as Little Naoki goes on about history, Naoki spends a moment to consider and carefully word her response. \u201cWell. \u2026 It\u2019s important to remember, in the context of reading history, that perspective plays a large role. There\u2019s a saying that goes, \u2018History is always written by the winners.\u2019\u201dAfter allowing Little Naoki to consider that for a moment, she continues, \u201cThe people who write the books are people, and people have opinions, biases, and varying perspectives. Those opinions and biases make their way into the writing and often vilify one party in favor of glorifying another, and furthermore, no single perspective is \u2018correct\u2019, really. They\u2019re just... perspectives, and aren\u2019t all quite the same, even if they depict the same events. Also, the books don\u2019t cover all of the circumstances that lead up to each decision being made.\u201d\u201cTo draw a metaphor, it\u2019s like looking through a stained glass window- like the ones in a church. What you can see is not all that there is, you can\u2019t see it very clearly, it\u2019s all distorted, and someone looking through another window might think that different things are happening.\u201d Unsure of how much of that explanation Little Naoki will be able to follow and absorb, Naoki does her best to pay attention to the sensation the child\u2019s face in her cleavage and try to discern at what point in the explanation she loses her namesake, if at all.  All the while, Naoki continues to rub and scratch at the girl\u2019s ears, almost absently at this point. ", "1475351940000": "\u201cMmm\u2026\u201d Naoki murmurs noncommittally, shrugging a bit. \u201cNot really, no. They\u2019re not lying, per say. Here, cover your eyes.\u201d With one hand, Naoki gently guides her namesake\u2019s face back into her chest, intending to obscure her vision.Once Naoki is fairly certain Little Naoki can\u2019t see what she\u2019s doing, Naoki opens one of the drawers on her desk, and after a moment of rummaging around with one hand extracts an interesting sort of paperweight, made of blown glass. It exists in the shape of a perfect teardrop, evidently intended to balance on the larger end. To enable such balancing, a weight has been placed within the otherwise clear glass. Alden would be able to see rather clearly as Naoki places it on the desk, that the weight exists in the form of two rectangular prisms, aligned parallel to the other. One of them is silver, and the other gold, both opaque. Carefully, Naoki positions the paperweight in the middle of the desk, directly between her and Alden. She then turns it such so that the silver side is facing her and Little Naoki and the golden side is facing Alden. As it is, neither would be able to see the other side, the other weight. With it positioned as such, Naoki taps the child in her lap gently, indicating that she should turn around. Pointing to the paperweight, Naoki\u2019s question is simple. \u201cWhat color is the square inside?\u201dAfter Little Naoki gives her answer, Naoki then addresses Alden, \u201cAnd what color is the square inside, Alden?\u201d Gesturing slightly in his direction, Naoki intends to imply that he should feel free to complete the lesson if he would like to.", "1475393147000": "Smiling, Naoki rewards her namesake by beginning to pat the top of her head. It\u2019s a bit of a strange movement considering where the top of her head is, but Naoki doesn\u2019t seem particularly put off by it. \u201cYes. But it\u2019s also important to remember that it isn\u2019t always possible to see both sides. If you had written a book about it, you would have said it was silver. If your father had written a book about it, he would have said that it was gold. But if neither of you was able to move the paperweight to see the other side, you would both think that the other is wrong. Real life works in the same way sometimes, and most of the time, the authors of books try to do all they can to provide an accurate account or information. But sometimes, you can\u2019t see every side of a situation- in the same way, that you can\u2019t see the gold and the silver at the same time. With this in mind, you should always seek information from multiple, diverse sources. Multiple sources provide multiple viewpoints, multiple perspectives, and having a thorough understanding of as many perspectives as you can enables you to make the best decisions you possibly can.\u201dSliding her patting hand back behind the girl\u2019s ears and beginning to scratch, Naoki leans back into the seat and wraps her other arm about Little Naoki\u2019s midsection, hugging her close in an attempt to calm her- perhaps have her stop bouncing. \u201cNow hold on to that for a moment while I see what your father needs.\u201dWith this, Naoki levies an inquisitive eyebrow in Alden\u2019s direction, prompting him to begin with whatever it is he\u2019s come to her office for. As enjoyable as it is to teach Little Naoki things, Big Naoki\u2019s curiosity is getting the better of her- it isn\u2019t often that Alden requests to speak with her.

I\u2019ll send for it.\u201dA moment passes in relative silence as Naoki\u2019s earring glimmers- a visual indication of her telepathy in use. All the while, Naoki continues to idly scratch at her namesake\u2019s ears, as one might with a more traditional feline.

In a sudden and perhaps uncharacteristic show of affection, Naoki tilts her head downward to plant a quick kiss on Little Naoki\u2019s forehead. Though it was very much a spur of the moment decision, Naoki does her best to play it off casually, following it up with a few more head pats and only blushing slightly. \u201cThat\u2019s an excellent name. It might cause a bit of confusion in that you\u2019ll be High Marshal Alden Marshal\u2026 but at the same time, it\u2019s somewhat fitting.\u201dAlmost as if on cue, a young pageboy enters the room after knocking once. Shuffling his way up to the desk, he does his very best not to question what all is going on, instead deciding to simply do as he was asked- depositing his stack of papers on the desk before turning about to leave. Nodding to the page as he exits, Naoki reaches over to take one off the top, bringing it closer for Little Naoki to see. \u201cThese are citizenship alteration papers. They can be used to officially change the details of one\u2019s citizenship, like one\u2019s name, address, or marital status. In this box, you put your current name. In this one, you put what you want to change. In this case, it\u2019s \u2018legal name\u2019. Then over here, you put what you want to change it to. Leave the rest of the boxes alone, and then sign it down here near the X.\u201dWith one hand, Naoki slides some papers on her desk to one side, making room for Little Naoki to place the form on the desktop. Then she takes her quill- an extravagant bright blue feather of some sort dips it in some ink, and offers it to Little Naoki, apparently intending for her to fill out the form herself. Alden would find the rest of the papers to be exactly the same as the first, and a second quill to be present off on one side of the desk. ", "1475640273000": "Returning the hug, Naoki is- for only the space of a moment, struck with a sharp pang of anguish. Though her namesake probably wouldn\u2019t be able to see it, she may be able to feel it as a single tear drop rolls off Naoki\u2019s chin. However, Naoki plays it off casually, rubbing her sleeve on her face and proceeding to adjust herself in the seat to better allow the child on her lap to write on the desk. Watching over her shoulder as Little Naoki fills out the paperwork, Naoki nods with approval once she\u2019s done. \u201cYou did. Excellent work.\u201dFor this, Little Naoki is awarded several more head pats. Taking the other six sheets of paper from Alden, Naoki gives them all a cursory once-over, but they all seem to be in order. Stacking Little Naoki\u2019s with the rest, Naoki sets the whole stack off to one side of the desk.\u201cI\u2019ll have these sent to the treasury department. Once they process them, you will be mailed a notice that states that the change was successful. Once you receive that, the process is complete, and your names will have been changed legally.\u201d", "1475740032000": "\u201cIt was my pleasure, Alden.\u201d Evidently, even though Alden technically has a last name now (or will once the paperwork is processed), Naoki seems disinclined to use it. As she is hugged, Naoki reciprocates, substituting the kiss for a final few ear scratches. \u201cI\u2019ll do you one better,\u201d Naoki responds, leaning over the desk and wagging a finger. \u201cWhat\u2019s today\u2026 Tuesday? \u2026 Yes, Tuesday. Tomorrow is Wednesday, and I will be busy. But on Thursday, my afternoon is free. So what if- just after lunch on Thursday, you come over here, and I\u2019ll give you a tour of The Citadel?\u201dAfter pausing to wait out the girl\u2019s initial reaction, Naoki adds an addendum, \u201cWith the understanding, of course, that you\u2019ll have to bring any of your brothers or sisters who might want to come, and only if your father says that it\u2019s ok.\u201d", "1475843760000": "\u201cUntil then.\u201dWaving to the pair as they depart, Naoki spends the space of a few minutes in contemplation, simply sitting, gazing off toward the closed doors. After reaching a conclusion of some sort, she nods once to herself and stands. Another few moments are spent in putting her desk back together, putting the quill in its holder, capping the ink bottles, and moving the citizenship alteration forms into her outbox. Apparently satisfied with this, she nods to herself again and decides that she\u2019s about as ready as she\u2019s going to be to speak with her next visitor- apparently there\u2019s a queue. Rather than having the guards beckon her next guest in, Naoki opts to receive whoever it is personally. Striding down the length of her office, she turns about to push one of the tall double doors open with her backside, and eyes up the small crowd gathered on the bench outside. Singling out Aia Heijra with a pointed finger, Naoki inquires, \u201cYou\u2019re next?\u201d Assuming an affirmative response, she turns the point into a beckoning motion, \u201cCome in, then.\u201dAfter seeing the woman in the door, Naoki would cross back over to her desk and reseat herself behind it, prompting the other woman to take a guest seat and begin with whatever it is they need to say. ", "1475917909000": "Looking on quietly as the woman seats herself and presents her gift, Naoki nods every so often to indicate that she\u2019s following. As the specifics of the gift and its uses are revealed, she nods more readily,  offering the woman a grateful sort of smile. However, when the woman refers to her simply as \u2018Naoki\u2019, her eyebrows furrow slightly. Though she isn\u2019t usually a stickler for official proceedings and impeccable etiquette, it\u2019s awfully presumptuous of this Varan woman- whom Naoki has only met in the past minute or two, and hasn\u2019t even introduced herself to drop the title, Naoki thinks. For goodness\u2019 sakes, Alden used the title, and he\u2019s known her for years. However, not one to be truly aggravated by such small transgressions, evidence of Naoki's irritation disappears almost immediately. Without too much more to say, she simply responds with, \u201cYou have my most heartfelt thanks.\u201dAs an afterthought, she adds, \u201cI think I\u2019ll have it made into a cloak,\u201d figuring that to be the best way to get the most out of the fabric. Smaller, individual garments would not protect the entirety of her body in the same way that a cloak might.With this stated, Naoki finds herself unsure. That could be all this woman has to say. It\u2019s a fairly significant gift that makes sense to be presented personally, but at the same time, this woman doesn\u2019t seem the sort to come all the way down to her office simply to give a gift. Varans aren\u2019t the most romantic of peoples, Naoki thinks. Figuring that this would be a reasonable way for the woman to transition into either her next order of business or her exit, Naoki continues, \u201cI didn\u2019t catch your name, though, Ms....?\u201d", "1475986390000": "\u201cAh, yes, I\u2019ve heard of you.\u201d Extending her hand over the desk, Naoki offers it for shaking, \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you, and allow me to thank you again. If you ever find yourself in need of my assistance, don\u2019t hesitate to ask. However, until such time as we meet again- hopefully under equally pleasant circumstances, I bid you farewell, and wish you the best with the rest of your day.\u201dAfter Aia presumably shakes her hand, Naoki offers the woman another smile, and a wave in farewell. ", "1485565044000": "In what has become a well-practiced motion, the guards standing to either side of the double doors leading into Lady Naoki\u2019s office push said doors inward, giving the visitors about as wide of a berth as they can, given the circumstances. Cassandra and Ravanys would find that on the whole, Naoki\u2019s office is mostly empty and rather warm, as it tends to be. Down at the far end of the room, in one of the large alcoves behind the desk, there is movement. Two figures, their backs turned to the door, are sitting at a table, shuffling papers about and occasionally making notes. One of the individuals seems to be markedly small, with blonde hair flowing loosely and the other has the hook of a brown cloak up over their head. Neither speak or seem to have any particular reaction to Naoki\u2019s visitors entering the room. Lady Naoki herself is seated in the high-backed chair behind her desk, reading a book. After a moment, presumably during which she finished whatever paragraph she was reading, she places a bookmark in it and sets it aside to give her visitors her full attention. However, she says nothing, only looking to the pair of them expectantly. ", "1485838461000": "Sitting there as she is, Lady Naoki nods in both of their directions as they bow, and smirks a bit to herself as Cassandra struggles for words. It\u2019s somewhat endearing, she thinks, that it seems as if Cassandra here can walk the walk, but not talk the talk in a very literal sense. Thinking back, Naoki doesn\u2019t recall Crovan saying anything significant in regards to his sister. The only information Naoki has was sourced by Emahra, following her not-an-investigation, and Takhana, in her normal operations. What they had to say was hardly shining praise, but Naoki opts to give Cassandra the benefit of the doubt, as she often does. Meanwhile, her companion isn\u2019t showing any cracks, moving in the \u2018proper\u2019 ways and seeming very much a professional. Probably would do a significantly better job were she in Cassandra\u2019s current position. She doesn\u2019t quite seem one to be from the Winterlands, so Naoki presumes that she must have experience from somewhere abroad. The pair of them, standing as they are, remind Naoki of herself and Artemis, which isn\u2019t exactly pleasant to consider, so Naoki ceases to contemplate such matters.\u201cIt is a pleasure to make your acquaintance,\u201d Naoki offers, playing along with the regal tone they\u2019ve set.After a momentary pause, she continues, \u201cI have indeed met Lord Crovan. In fact, I\u2019ve gone so far as to reach an agreement wherein his holdings have become a portion of Isra.\u201dShe opts to omit the others manners in which she has known Crovan. However, that seems to be all Naoki has to say. Having been intentionally ambiguous, she raises one eyebrow slightly, interested to see how Cassandra proceeds. ", "1485890329000": "Ah, yet another job seeker. It\u2019s been awhile since she\u2019s had one of these sorts of meetings, Naoki muses. Some things don't change. After listening to what Cassandra has to say, Naoki nods her acquiescence and gestures toward the chairs. \u201cI accredit a significant portion of my success to my ability to delegate, and the skills of those who work toward my goals. I am always seeking competent and willing individuals to strengthen further and expand The Free States. Be seated, and tell me about yourself, your skills, your experiences.\u201dLeaning back into her seat, Lady Naoki uses her left hand to pluck a quill from her desk and begins to twirl it in her hand as she directs an ear in Cassandra's direction.", "1487432945000": "\u201cHmmh,\u201d a noise Naoki makes to pause a conversation until she sees it fit to continue. It\u2019s her opinion that anything related to fashion trends would hardly fall into Crovan\u2019s set of duties, but the essence of what Cassandra is getting at is clear enough. Here is an asset Naoki has yet to have the opportunity to make use of, a noblewoman. The majority of Isra\u2019s governmental officials have been present since Isra\u2019s foundation, members of that original group of refugees who possessed some manner of skill that would be mildly useful in such a context. Over the years, of course, some have come and gone, but only some. Of the current group, few could plausibly be considered noble, the most notable of which Naoki has put into place herself. Even then, there aren\u2019t enough to count on two hands, and only Crovan possesses something that could plausibly be categorized as a noble house. There is no noble class in Isra. Which is fitting and probably very intentional, Naoki supposes. She certainly wouldn\u2019t be one to start granting power based on bloodline, and it would be unacceptable to recognize some families as superior to others. But. With that in mind, cultivating a group of loyal, high-class families could be quite useful as another way to exert influence. But that would be a much longer term sort of plan. For now, Naoki resolves to begin by setting up Cassandra. \u201cI think that you may not immediately be well suited to a high office, as you yet lack most of the requisite contextual and leaderships skills needed to head any sort of department. You could plausibly do well not in a leadership position, but perhaps as a diplomat, but I\u2019m not yet comfortable enough with you to send you about to speak in my name. It would be best for you to begin by establishing yourself. You seek to make a way and a name for yourself independent of your brother, so why not begin by doing just that.\u201dUsing her free hand, Lady Naoki slides a blank bit of paper to sit before her, dips the quill she\u2019s been twirling, and begins to write as she talks.\u201cThere is no hereditary transfer of power here in Isra, only the opinion of the public. If you give the public a reason to dislike you, you will be disliked, and find it more difficult to accomplish your goals as a result. Begin to consider your actions through the eyes of the everyman, and be cautious not to anger him. If you are well liked and respected prior to attempting to, say, win an election\u2026\u201d Trailing off, Naoki raises her arms up to either side implicatively, letting the results speak for themselves. After a moment, she turns back down and resumes her scribbling. \u201cRight now, your slate is blank. Those with particularly strong opinions about your brother may associate those feelings with you as well, and those you\u2019ve already met will have their own opinions, but the public does not know you. As such, you\u2019ll begin by constructing a house here in Isra. Constructing, specifically, not purchasing, for two reasons. The first is that I don\u2019t believe there are any suitable residences current available, and the second would be to seed awareness of yourself. Ensure that the workers are treated well, come by to observe their progress a few times, and perhaps treat the lot of them to something at the job\u2019s completion to ensure that they come away with a positive impression.\u201d\u201cThen, once you\u2019ve moved in and properly established yourself in the city, begin to look into business. Ideally, you would learn to manage such things yourself, but you probably ought to hire an expert at least to begin with. I'll lend you some of my people to use until you find your own. Your first business goal will be to establish a reliable income for yourself. I\u2019m sure that House Winter will be willing to cover your expenses to an extent, and I may be persuaded to fund the rest, but you do not want to be reliant on the charity of others in the long term. One option is to purchase an existing business, the other is to create one of your own. Ideally, you want to get into a stable market, one which will always see business. Whatever you decide to do, you want to personally involve yourself in the business to an extent. Be present, be pleasant, and earn yourself the respect of your employees.\u201dPlacing her quill back into the holder, Naoki spends a moment looking over what she\u2019s written before turning up to look Cassandra in the eye and ask, \u201cAt that point, you will have accomplished your goal of becoming someone notable in your own right, and be in a good position to advance further. Have you followed all of that?\u201d", "1487544326000": "Smirking slightly to herself, Lady Naoki replaces her quill into its holder. She wasn\u2019t quite sure what sort of reaction to expect out of Cassandra, but this is satisfactory. She seems impressionable, Cassandra. This ought to work out well.Naoki proceeds to slide the paper she had been writing across the desk, turning it for Cassandra to read. It would seem to be a collection of details relevant to the plan Naoki has just laid out. Information about the people Naoki intends to allow Cassandra use of, options for accommodations in the meantime, where to purchase materials, and other such things. In response to Cassandra, Naoki nods. \u201cYes. The walls were built generously. Though it is an issue I\u2019m considering, lack of space in the city won\u2019t be a problem for you. I would suggest looking toward the west side of the city.\u201d", "1488316663000": "As Cassandra contemplates and begins to internally lay the groundwork for her plans, Lady Naoki is content to simply sit. Leaning back slightly, she takes another moment to consider the pair of them, sitting there. How they might fit into the order of things, and how Cassandra\u2019s effort might be best directed. It\u2019s a consuming sort of topic to consider, simply due to the potential breadth of variables and ideas. After allowing a comfortable few moments of silence to pass, Naoki pipes up, \u201cIn any case, unless you have anything further you would like to discuss, I think we\u2019re about done here.\u201d", "1488774528000": "Lady Naoki\u2019s chin rests in her palm as she sits silently, observing the newest member of Isra\u2019s government as he approaches. Robert Fletcher. The last individual Ryden has and will ever shoehorn into her court. He\u2019s in the chocolate business, this one, which is hardly surprising to Naoki. A brief look into what files are available on him revealed a few other details of only minor interest, which Naoki found to be encouraging. As opposed to that half-pint from months past, Robert here seems to be decidedly without any obvious intentions to cause trouble for her. \u201cLikewise,\u201d she responds. There doesn't seem to be much more that seems fitting.Quirking an eyebrow and tilting an ear, she continues, \u201cA sample of\u2026 what?\u201d ", "1488921965000": "Using one hand to accept the box from him, Lady Naoki takes a few moments to observe the items within, nodding a few times as he describes them, before setting the box off to one side of her desk. With her newly freed hand, she gestures to the chairs sitting before her desk, inviting him to have a seat. He certainly did go to great lengths to produce such an object, though. There must be all of about seven farmers living in the Norkari Mountains, this is the first Naoki has heard of any sort of mining in Sakand, and there doesn\u2019t seem to be any particular reason to assemble the thing in Port Silverion -  unless it were to be shipped out immediately afterward, in which case that would make a lot of sense, but not for this example sitting on her desk. In any case, she addresses him, \u201cHmmh. Fair enough, thank you. I\u2019ll hope to see you coordinate more thorough exploitation of all natural resources Isra has access to. Have a seat, tell me what you\u2019ve got to say, and then I\u2019ll ask what questions of mine remain, and give you what instructions I will.\u201d", "1488958134000": "Leaning back in her seat slightly as she settles in to listen to what Robert has to say, Lady Naoki nods slightly at the mentions of commercial fishing and whaling. That\u2019s all well and good and shouldn\u2019t violate the treaty with the Queen of the Depths. If there\u2019s fishing to be done, why not do it, as, in addition to the fishing itself, a fishing industry will breed strong sailors, which are then useful to the navy, should they be required.However, as he continues, Naoki stops nodding. Instead, she raises one eyebrow in inquiry, tilts her head and one ear off slightly to the side, and fixes Robert with something of a searching look. She isn\u2019t sure why he\u2019s grinning. After allowing a few moment to pass in silence as she collects her thoughts, Naoki raises one hand with which to speak with, and replies, \u201cYou are the Minister of Primary Industries. It is your task to direct and grow industries within Isra, to strengthen its economic backbone, to allow Isra to maintain a profitable trade surplus, complete state projects, and provide work for citizens.\u201dFor a moment she pauses, to allow this to sink in.\u201cFixing an urchin problem that arguably isn\u2019t even there, to begin with, is only tangentially related to your responsibilities and your budget. I appreciate the thought, certainly. Having once been a \u2018transient minor\u2019 myself, I have a great deal of sympathy for the group. If there were many more of these \u2018transient minors\u2019 than there are, and if they were causing significant issues, this would be a very elegant solution.\"The manner in which she says, \"transient minor\" is only slightly mocking.\"But as it stands, there are many more productive things you could be doing with your time and much more pressing issues. The mining operations in the Norkari Mountains and The Winterlands could both stand to be improved and expanded upon. We don\u2019t have nearly enough steel production. Along with the gem mines in Medan, there are also a few sizeable quarries that we need to begin operating. It would also be nice if Isra were not quite so dependent on The Land Tillers\u2019 state for food imports.\u201dHere, Naoki pauses for another moment.\u201cAs such, your Transient Youth Education and Employment program does not have my approval. Not yet, at least. Once some of those aforementioned issues are resolved, once you\u2019ve displayed proficiency, and once the budget can more comfortably support pet projects, perhaps. But not today.\u201d", "1489280428000": "Nodding with more apparent approval, Lady Naoki responds, \u201cYes, excellent. After I start to see some improvements in those categories, I\u2019ll probably end up letting you lose on the children of the city.\u201dWith this, Naoki waves a hand dismissively and changes the subject. \u201cIn any case, in regards to your work, I\u2019ll expect reports. I\u2019ll expect reports and updates on a regular basis and whenever something of note takes place. I\u2019m not going to ask that you monitor every minuscule facet of every project and send my hourly letters, but I should never have to ask how a project of yours is going. You should be prepared to visit this office of mine on a regular basis, for more meetings like these. On occasion, I\u2019ll call together the entire conclave, and in that case, we\u2019ll meet in the chambers down the hall and off down to the left, but more often than not it\u2019s more convenient for all involved for me to speak with each individually, like this.\u201d", "1489467198000": "\u201cThere is not. I\u2019ll look forward to seeing you back here with news of great success and more chocolate. \u2026 Until then.\u201d With this, Naoki gives Robert a polite and dismissive nod, signaling the end of their meeting. After watching him rise and leave, and after waiting for the doors to shut behind him, Naoki slides her one hand across the desk to open the box that Robert brought and pull out one of the pieces of chocolate. Enlisting the assistance of her other hand, Naoki partially removes the foil and begins to nibble on one corner of the bar. Strawberry\u00a0flavored. Fair enough.If nothing else, Robert knows how things work around here, she supposes.", "1489526019000": "Kannon would be made to wait for the space of about twenty minutes before the guards tending Lady Naoki\u2019s door bid him to enter. Once he does, Kannon would find Lady Naoki not sitting at her desk, but rather standing off to the left of it, one arm held in the other behind her back. After responding to his bow with a respectful nod, she turns part-way to the side and gestures past her desk to one of the larger tables in the rear of the room, where a few others had gathered beforehand. Unremarkable clerical sorts, by the looks of them, likely present to transcribe the results of whatever resolutions Naoki and Kannon will reach and save Naoki the trouble of writing things out herself. Arrayed on the table are a series of maps, copies of previously ratified documents, and blank sheets of parchment, all standing ready for the upcoming meeting.\u201cHave a seat,\u201d Lady Naoki offers, before moving to take one herself, with the window to her back. After she has, Naoki rests her chin atop her interwoven fingers and eyes Kannon, beginning to speculate in regards to what sort of person he might be and waiting for him to bring up the first of these \u2018issues\u2019 he seems to have. She has a few ideas about what sorts of things might need to be discussed, but would rather wait to see what he considers a priority first.", "1489823974000": "\u201cHmmh.\u201d After listening to what Kannon has to say, Lady Naoki spends a few moments in contemplation before responding, \u201cWell, as far as trade is concerned, there is only so much I can say for certain at the moment, as we are only just beginning to set the wheels of industry spinning again in Medan. Information related to output, what might or might not be viable to export at this point, and where Medan\u2019s budget is going to be focused is unavailable at present. As such, we\u2019re not going to be able to hash out a complete set of trade agreements conclusively, but then again, such things don\u2019t tend to go unchanged for long anyway.\u201d\u201cWith that said, we ought to be able to make significant progress. For a starting point, why don\u2019t you tell us about your previous trade agreements with the Goraian regime? Discluding those which involved the slave mines and such, I imagine that Isra would be willing to consider similar sorts of arrangements to fill critical shortages for Aozora.\u201d", "1490246367000": "Nodding to herself, Naoki supposes all of that seems reasonable enough. She\u2019s aware of where those metals were coming from, and why Goraia wasn\u2019t keen on sharing that information, and debates whether to share that information with Fujimoto here or not, but decides that there's a more pressing question first. Quirking an eyebrow and tilting an ear slightly to one side, she asks, \u201cIf I might, who, exactly, is down there for you to siege with a prototype siege weapon? I\u2019ve never visited anything that far south personally, but as far as I\u2019ve been made aware, there\u2019s not any substantial state-like entities or influential militant groups.\u201d", "1490765656000": "\u201cI see.\u201dThat situation seems like one that perhaps has considerably more depth than it might appear at first. Maybe Kannon is entirely honest, but why would Aozora need a new sort of weapon explicitly? That seems like the kind of thing that could be dealt with quickly by any moderately competent army. If it\u2019s a city held faction of bandits, it ought to lack the metaphorical discipline and fortitude necessary to survive any siege. Regardless, it isn't as if Aozora could become a threat anyway, so \u201cFair enough,\u201d says Lady Naoki. \u201cIsra has the means to produce your parts, and is most probably willing to sell them to you assuming that the rest of these talks go well.\u201dFor a few beats, she pauses, before another thought occurs to her.\u201cIt occurs to me; there is not a road by land leading through the mountain range that is Medan\u2019s northern border. These components we are referring to would have to be transported by sea, from Isra to Port Silverion to probably Stonevale, and then from there to Aozora over land. That won\u2019t be an issue, though.\u201dAssuming that Kannon is going to continue, Naoki follows her last statement up with silence.", "1491170690000": "Mildly pleased with these developments, Lady Naoki nods, and responds, \u201c... Alright then. Fortunately enough, Isra possesses a good deal of information regarding Goraian high command figures, which will be shared with you. If anything comes of it, Isra will be willing to assist with apprehension, and Aozora will be compensated fairly. Depending on the circumstance, we may need to negotiate further, but that will be a discussion for that point.\u201dOn the sides of the table, the clerical staff continues scratching away with their quills, writing all manner of documents. It's questionable how they're deriving so much from as relatively little conversation, but such is the wonder of bureaucracy.", "1491852608000": "Nodding her head deeply in response, Lady Naoki responds, \u201cThis was a productive meeting. The relevant documents will be delivered to your offices as soon as they\u2019re ready, and if anything of note arises, you\u2019ll be informed. Until we meet again.\u201dRising, Naoki signals the closure of the meeting. Over the course of the next short while, the clerical staff would finish their work, pleasantries would be exchanged, and all involved would go about their business. ", "1492053285000": "The guards open the path impassively, with little hesitation. Within, Lady Naoki is seated, evidently hard at work reading a hefty tome spread across the surface of her desk. Upon looking up and identifying her visitor, her face brightens, and she sits up, placing a marker where she was reading. Though the book isn\u2019t quite something that she can move to the side without disrupting other things on the desk, it\u2019s clear that Naoki is no longer giving it her attention. Offering a smile and a nod in greeting, she waits for Liz to approach and seat herself. ", "1492468944000": "Reaching one hand up and across, Naoki takes the stack of papers such so that she might examine them. She spends a few silent moments leafing through the documents, skimming their contents. As she does, her smile fades but doesn\u2019t transition into anything in particular. Naoki only nods, understanding. \u201cI see.\u201dSetting the stack of papers aside, Naoki adjusts herself in her seat to sit more comfortably, leaning her elbow on the desk. Idly, Naoki begins to spin a quill with her free hand as she looks Liz over and spends another few moments in thought, in reflection. Several years have passed since Naoki sponsored Elizabeth Finch into the Dawn Riders. It's been quite some time since Lieutenant Finch assisted the Medanese refugees with their integration into Isra, and since her promotion to Commodore associated with the restructuring of Isra's armed forces. Now, here's High Commodore Finch's resignation, sitting here on Naoki's desk. And yet, despite the massive loss this represents as far as military administration goes, and what this resignation will do to destabilize her rule, Naoki can't help but also feel somewhat... relieved. Pleased, on a personal level, that Liz will no longer be at the forefront of battles, in the thick of the fighting, at risk to be hurt or killed. However, she does openly express as much at this moment. Setting aside the professional concerns for the moment, Naoki shifts her tone toward the informal and asks, \"So you've had your fill of the military life, then?\"", "1492924417000": "As she listens, Naoki\u2019s expression shifts to one of mild alarm as she realizes that Liz is upset, and the effect the past few years have apparently had upon her. Guilt sets in within the space of moments. Opening and shutting her mouth, Naoki searches something to say but finds nothing.; finding the right words to comfort someone has never been a talent of hers.Though she feels as if it goes without saying that she supports Liz\u2019 decision, Naoki articulates as much, \u201cOf course not, of course not\u2026\u201dBut that doesn\u2019t very much address the underlying issue. Unable to simply sit and watch, Naoki places her palms down against the surface of the desk and rises to her feet. She proceeds out from behind her desk, around the side, and extends her arms as she approaches Liz. Naoki then wraps her arms around Liz\u2019 shoulders to offer a sort of side hug. Due to the difference in height due to Liz being seated, her head is about level Naoki\u2019s chest. Naoki figures that if Liz is going to cry, she may as well cry into something soft. ", "1493145477000": "Having successfully averted the spilling of tears, Naoki files her efforts as a sort of success and pulls away without further awkwardness. Wryly, she notes that there seem to be few problems she cannot apply herself to to solve, though she does find it somewhat frustrating she saw no alternative options in this instance. Still, Liz\u2019 change of subject is welcome, and Naoki moves to lean against the front of her desk as she listens.\u201cA ranch?\u201dCrossing her arms over her chest, Naoki raises one eyebrow in a politely inquisitive gesture. One does not hear aspirations to become a farmer; farmers have aspirations to become something else, and ranching is an extension of farming. Based on their last discussion, Naoki had expected Liz\u2019 post-retirement goals to be significantly less\u2026 rustic. Still, she awaits elaboration. ", "1494124548000": "Apr 25, 2017 11:59:48 GMT -8 Elizabeth Finch said:\"Oh absolutely! But not just any ranch, it'LL have like horses and such, but some exotic animals as well. For instance, there is still some wild griffins in the mountains, and if I'm lucky and go at the right time I may be able to find an abandoned nest and raise them by hand. My father, in a rare moment of parental guidance or lack of desire to raise them, also left me a breeding pair of dire wolf puppies before he left.\"Which reminded her that she needed to pick up bigger bones for them, they were getting awfully big and had snapped the deer ones leftover from St. George's Dinner. \"Not a bad start then eh? Might head over to LTS and see about getting some wyverns, couple people over there owe me some favors anyway.\"\u201cThe\u2026 exotic ranching business, then.\u201dRaising a hand to rub at her chin, Naoki spends a moment to consider the notion. What a novel concept it is. There are, of course, many ranches in the Free Plains, as the city has significant needs for animals that must be met, but those are only common animals. Cattle, pigs, sheep, and the like. There are a few reputable horse ranches, but nothing at all like what Liz is describing.Presently, Naoki begins to nod. \u201cThat sounds like it would be very fitting. I bet St. George will get jealous, what with you giving so many others so much of your time.\u201d Naoki exhales sharply, evidently finding the notion somewhat amusing. She continues, \u201cHow far have you gotten in your planning? You intend to run it as a private business, hire workers from the city to do the menial labor?\u201d", "1495539396000": "May 7, 2017 13:56:34 GMT -8 Elizabeth Finch said:Liz grins at the mention of St. George's jealousy issues, a facet of bonding with these creatures that so few of them did not get jealous when their partner showed attention to others.\"He will be fine I hope, as I will need his help to deal with most of them. Most ranchers ride horses to go from place to place, I will have a rather loyal griffin at my disposal,\" she said, the grin getting a tad wider as she brushes some of her hair out of her eyes.\"Pretty far, I have quite a few veterans I am looking to hire, they have experience with such creatures, and with their griffins dead they are no longer able to serve in the Riders. A sad fact, but I was happy to be able to provide them with meaningful work.\"Pushing herself up off the side of the desk, Naoki moves around to reseat herself as she listens to Liz, smiling slightly to herself. Hearing Liz speak enthusiastically about her plans serves to assuage Naoki\u2019s concerns and draws a smile on her face.\u201cWell, if there is anything that you find yourself in need of- for your ranch, or for anything else, I want you to tell me. You know the sorts of things I can have done, and if I can help you in some way, I would like to.\u201d In this, Naoki seems earnest and apparently feels no need to justify her request.Pointing one finger across the desk, she continues, \u201cAnd I\u2019ll expect you to visit. ... If you don\u2019t come visit me, I will come visit you, and in that case, you'll be glad that your workers are capable enough to work without assistance.\u201d Smirking, Naoki lowers one eyebrow and raises the other to punctuate her statement with that lighthearted implied threat.", "1495779360000": "At Liz\u2019 request, Naoki exhales sharply, amused. \u201cI can do that. The market as it is now is almost entirely small animals, as I understand. Most of the offenders come in, having tried to sell something sapient- often fairies or woodland spirits. As long as whatever it is cannot follow a conversation- and doesn't harm anyone or anything like that, it ought not to be a problem.\u201d With that topic seemingly sorted, Naoki moves toward another. Reaching to pick up the stack of parchment Liz arrived with, she begins to leaf through it, now taking the time to examine and draw meaning from the documents. \u201cIn any case,\u201d she continues over the top of the papers, \u201cKnight-Commander Calgary. He must be the best option available, but why is that? If you wouldn\u2019t mind my asking, tell me about him. Tell me what you think of him, about him as an individual, and your reasoning in selecting him above your other options.\u201d", "1496187306000": "\u201cHmmh. Fair enough. I suspect he and I will get on quite well then, but it will remain to be seen how he fares in that administrative position, and how he handles the additional responsibilities that come with it.\u201d Honestly, Naoki isn\u2019t entirely sure what she expected, but Liz\u2019 response is a valid enough answer. It speaks to the man\u2019s strengths. From somewhere behind the desk, she pulls a quill, and begins to spin  it between her fingers as she asks, \u201cWould you like to complete the resignation process now, then?...\u201d", "1496510315000": "Naoki rolls her eyes and shakes her head slightly at Liz\u2019 continued formality, but still proceeds, taking a blank sheet of parchment from one of her stacks and taking the quill to it. For about a minute, the only sound in the room is that of quill scraping on parchment as Naoki dutifully pens the document.  Soon, she is finished, and after checking her work, Naoki signs her name at the bottom.  \u201cElizabeth Finch, you have been relieved of your position of High Commodore, all of the duties included therein, and indeed, all association with the Isran government. As of this moment, you are now a private citizen. \u2026 Congratulations.\u201d Lifting the document from the desk, Naoki holds it in such a way that Liz is able to see it. It\u2019s a simply worded thing, stating that by the High Lady\u2019s order, Liz has been released from all duties, effective immediately. Further, Naoki will handle the details of that instead of the management sorts who usually attend to such matters, and it states that Calgary is to function as Acting Commodore until such a point as another is formally appointed. \u201cI\u2019ll have your items sent to you. Your armor, your weapons, uniforms, riding equipment- all of that will be indeed yours, with the understanding that the act of impersonating Isran officials is illegal.\u201d", "1497049227000": "Naoki shrugs. \u201cI imagine it would depend on the circumstance, there\u2019s a difference between a foreign agent infiltrating our ranks and someone like yourself wearing old uniforms. I only mean to remind you that you should be mindful of wearing things with Suns all over them, lest you be mistaken as actively serving.\u201d Turning slightly to one side, she begins to move a hand down toward the desk drawers on one side, but pauses, reconsiders, and decides not, withdrawing her hand.  \u201cIn any case, that\u2019s that. Is there anything else on your mind, would you like to go sit down?\u201d With a jerk of her head, Naoki gestures behind her to the secondary portions of her office, where there exists more comfortable and casual seating.", "1498138484000": "\u201cI don\u2019t have anything in much on my mind either- just these damn records.\u201d  With the back of her hand, Naoki knocks the huge book spread across her desk. As it happens, it\u2019s a book of records. Records of the stars, at that. Each entry details a particular position in the sky that a given object was in at the listed time and date, all of which are more than eighty years ago. \u201cI\u2019d like to finish and be done with these, so why don\u2019t we meet later to do something? We could talk over a meal, maybe visit the bathhouse, or\u2026\u201d Naoki trails off.  \u201cOh!\u201d Struck by a thought, Naoki excitedly taps her hand twice on the desk before pointing at Liz and continuing, \u201cOh, I\u2019d like to introduce you to Haru. Whatever we decide to do, I\u2019ll introduce you to Haru beforehand, but\u2026\u201d Trailing off again, Naoki runs the tip of her tongue across her upper lip as she considers. \u201cBut. Keeping the secret, I have something in mind that we could do... Do for lunch, perhaps. What do you think? If you have a good idea, we could do that too.\u201d Smirking and quirking one eyebrow, Naoki leans forward and then back in her seat, waiting for Liz\u2019 response.", "1499262321000": "At Liz\u2019 mention of being a free woman, Naoki exhales sharply; she\u2019s stating it as if her military service were some manner of indentured servitude- here, in Isra! Naoki takes it as a small joke. But over the next of the next few moments, Naoki comes to consider, it sort of is, it sort of was. But that type of thinking has no place here, and this is the pretense Naoki uses to discard it. \u201cHaru is\u2026\u201d Trailing off, she considers.  \u201cHaru is unique, in that there are no words to describe what he is, as far as I\u2019m aware. If I were to describe him, Haru is an entity who takes the shape of- essentially, a giant cat. A large, long, cat- almost as tall as St. George, but then some\u2026 nine feet long, perhaps.\u201d She shrugs slightly, speaking with her hands. \u201cAnd,\u201d Naoki continues, loweing her tone and brandishing one finger, \u201cVery. Soft.\u201d After allowing a moment for that to sink in, she continues in a more conversational tone, \u201cHe has characteristics shared with cats, with dragons, and his behavior strikes me as not dissimilar to that of a paired griffin. But suffice to say, we've established things such that I am- in his words, his master, and things proceed between us as you might expect with that in mind. He\u2019s very friendly, and I think it may be interesting for you, as a friend and as one with interest in exotic \u2018beasts,' to meet him.\u201d \u201cThough, I would advise against referring to him as such,\u201d she adds, deadpan, \u201che\u2019s sharper than half the members of The Assembly.\u201d", "1501042718000": "Waving one hand, Naoki responds, \u201cI will handle our lunch; I have something in mind. Let\u2019s meet\u2026\u201d She trails off, considering. \u201cLet\u2019s meet the day after tomorrow, in the park by the south gate. \u2026 In the morning,\u201d she adds. \u201cWe can meet there and then go to lunch.\u201d", "1502308865000": "After considering for half a moment, Naoki shakes her head. \u201cNo. Nothing that can\u2019t wait until then. You may want to wear something comfortable.\u201dPlacing a bookmark in her book and pulling a sheaf of parchment from a drawer, Naoki stands and walks about the desk. \u201cYou take care until then,\u201d she says, offering a warm smile and a clap on the shoulder before moving to depart for the meeting. ", "1503015328000": "For the space of about two minutes, all is quiet. The Sentinels make a modest attempt in trying to look Alden without him noticing. In this, they are aided by the fact that their visors are down, but even so, they\u2019re only so discreet. Not there to be discreet, in any case.But presently at some unseen signal, they pull the doors outward allowing Alden entrance. The doors then close behind him.At the far end of the room, Lady Naoki is sitting at her desk, resting her legs atop it. For better or worse she seems to be wearing some manner of silken trousers and modesty is preserved for the time being. In any case, she holds a scroll between herself and a candle on her desk, as better to read it. Very clean scroll, not in the least bit tattered, as it has just been penned.As he approaches, Naoki acknowledges him by an upward inclination of her head and a tail gesture not unlike a wave. She continues to read carefully until the end, at which point Alden would likely be before the desk. Rolling it up into one hand Naoki moves to stand and spends a moment to adjust her outfit before coming around the desk to face him with a smile, arms partially extended.\u201cAlden! Greetings. How are you; how are the children?\u201d", "1503023860000": "Naoki finds herself surprised somewhat surprised as he moves in, but only somewhat. She can\u2019t very well blame anyone for taking the opportunity if presented, after all. But in this case, given Alden, of all people, given who he was when she met him. At that point, Naoki would have bet money that she, nor anyone else would ever receive a hug from Alden. Yet, here he is! Damn strong, too. He certainly hasn\u2019t softened in that regard, Naoki thinks. Feels almost like one of those statues from that one time. Bit warmer.In any case, what Alden has to say about the children is good, and of her namesake - amusing enough to warrant a few tasteful giggles, and she makes as much clear. She ought to take them up to the Chalet sometime, Naoki thinks. The most expansive library is there. The only trouble would be keeping them from burning it all to the ground.She nods slowly, considering. \u201cNot here,\u201d she says. The desk is not the right place. \u201cMmmmm\u2026 Over here, for convenience,\u201d She turns toward one of the two alcoves on the far wall, under the windows. Not the meeting table but rather the sitting area, with its assortment of low, cushioned chairs and end tables. Upon one table there is a tea set, the pot of which is still steaming, apparently fresh. Within one of the tables, the makings of a mini bar but Naoki doesn\u2019t touch either of them. Instead, she selects one of the larger chairs - one of the ones with a tail hole and turns it as to face Alden\u2019s chosen seat at an angle. In seating herself, Naoki considers what she\u2019s to do with the scroll. For the time being, she thinks, it will sit in her lap. There are worse spots to be than that.To Alden, the most elegant of conversation starters, \u201c... So.\u201d", "1503203407000": "\u201cOh?\u201d Naoki quirks one eyebrow politely. This is an unusual visit. Curious, Naoki\u2019s ears swivel forward to give Alden her full attention.\u201cWhat about?\u201d she asks, visibly concerned.", "1503247843000": "As Alden elaborates, Naoki\u2019s eyes unfocus and drift off to one side. It was easy for her to forget that part of him, his life. She was wrong to expect to something good, perhaps a pleasant dream about his future or his children he\u2019d like help in making a reality. Those sorts of dreams are the kind she enjoys granting. But perhaps it is, for him, in a roundabout way.\u201cI see,\u201d she says, as one might in such a suddenly morbid conversation as this. \u201cAnd do you feel that doing so will truly allow you to overcome your past? Is that your goal?\u201d", "1503251785000": "A silent \u201coh,\u201d of understanding. Mentally Naoki had likened his situation to her own from years past and assumed Alden's motives to be similar as well. Hers was a personal problem that she solved personally. In his case, there\u2019s also the matter of research material, more factors involved, a more complicated affair, she sees.\u201cThose may be the wrong words. \u2018To find closure\u2019 may be a better choice. To not try to sleep each night knowing that they could still be out there\u2026 Doing things.\u201d She shrugs slightly and makes a waving gesture referring to \u2018things,\u2019 the details of which she doubts either of them would like to discuss. \u201cThat would bother me, at least,\u201d she adds. ", "1503254085000": "Naoki says nothing. She nods solemnly, looking to the ground. Having been a child in that situation and now having children of his own, Alden must be doubly affected, so to speak. She puts a hand to her mouth as to cover the lower half of her face. The thought had been lingering with her ever since she\u2019d learned the extent of his story but put like this it seems excessively plausible.Removing her hand and looking back up to Alden she responds, \u201cOkay.\u201dA pause, \u201cWhat is your plan?\u201d", "1503257998000": "\u201cOh!\u201d One hand flies to her chest in surprise. More than anything so far in the conversation, this comes as a surprise. Not shocked that he would, but surprised that he did. \u201cOf course, of course\u2026\u201d She trails off, visibly considering the idea. The logistics of it are going to be a challenge; there\u2019s a whole pack of them. How old are they now\u2026?But Alden continues speaking, and Naoki does her best to focus back on what\u2019s he\u2019s saying. After he\u2019s finished, she nods, hands now on her chin. \u201cWell,\u201d she says, \u201cNot someone you would bring, but guess who\u2019s back?\u201dNaoki pauses, waits for a moment and continues, \u201cReese! Reese Cresno, you should remember him - the skeleton with the hat!\u201d Excited now, Naoki pantomimes the shape of a top hat. \u201cHe\u2019s returned from his\u2026\u201d she stumbles on the word choice. \u201cLet\u2019s say journey - he\u2019s returned from his journey, and he\u2019s just as sharp as before. Master of Scrying, he is; a finer one you\u2019ll not find full stop.\u201d\u201cBearing in mind your skills and his,\u201d she adds, more than a little bit smugly. \u201cYou should see him. I\u2019m unsure if his full collection of mystical lenses and assorted doo-dads are in place, but I guarantee he\u2019ll be able to help you.\u201d", "1503395346000": "Returning to the matter at hand, Naoki considers. The danger is all unknowable, any number of things could be there. The threat is significant enough that Alden thinks he needs help, and it\u2019s unknowable. She considers possible candidates aloud, \u201cJun comes first to mind. You know her, this seems right up her alley.\u201dUnable to sit still, Naoki has produced what looks like a pearl and rolls it between her hands as she continues, \u201cHowever, she's unavailable. Arya as well, off in the Eastern Woods, would need to be extracted...\u201d\u201cYou could ask Liz, retired as she is - but that would be you; I\u2019ll not ask any more of her. \u2026 I could easily have a wing of Dawn Riders detached. Depending on where the place is, easy enough to charter a vessel. What sort of accompaniment do you have in mind? Give me a hint,\u201d  she says.This, Naoki feels, is a very particular thing. And not with a positive connotation; it doesn't sit well with her.", "1503421695000": "Upon the realization, Naoki shakes her head, apologetic. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t infer entirely. Every other day, someone needs to go do something, and I need to figure the who. It seems like if the question is asked, I\u2019ll just happily run away with it. A habit.\u201d She laughs out of etiquette.\u201cBut, even so. Candidates all the same who all may be willing, worth considering.  ... What I think, though, is that a unit of Dawn Rider scouts will shadow you. The threats you face may not turn out to be the sort they can solve, but the thing about them - aside from their utility to you, is that I\u2019ll be able to ask them each time I\u2019m asked about you. Won\u2019t bother you.\u201dNaoki seems smug as she flicks her earring. An anticipated issue: sorted. \u201cAnd you could carry flares,\u201d she adds. \u201cIf something happens, I\u2019ll send a whole company!\u201d A grand arm gesture, speaking to the lengths she implies. Only partially exaggeration. \u201cItems, as well. You won\u2019t need to pack as heavily if you can count on getting packages,\u201d She points out.The entire thing is extraneous, Naoki realizes. If there\u2019s going to be trouble, it\u2019s most likely going to be a physical, mortal danger, and she can\u2019t do much about that. But the scouts, they\u2019ll give her peace of mind. May also be useful.", "1503531140000": "Naoki rolls her eyes, huffs, briefly flashes him an irritated look. She\u2019s half a mind to tell him very explicitly that she\u2019ll worry about whoever she desires to any extent of her will, at any point. Though, the thing about that, she thinks, is that she\u2019ll do it regardless full stop, so there\u2019s no sense in fussing about it.\u201cI\u2019ve been well,\u201d is the reflexive response. \u201cMostly well,\u201d she amends. \u201cWell in the sense that nothing is going much further wrong than they tend to. \u2026 Reese\u2019s back, I\u2019m quite pleased with that. I could tell you about all manner of problems to have. My favorite hairdresser\u2019s gone and injured herself, and my second-best is not anywhere near as good at their job. Got water in my ear twice, they have.\u201d\u201c... Twice!\u201d, she says, showing Alden two fingers emphatically, exaggerating herself slightly to demonstrate the triviality of the matter.She continues, \u201cA perhaps more relevant issue, Ryden is becoming a complete layabout. Each time I look to see what he\u2019s been up to, what he's been working on, it\u2019s less and less\u2026 And not serious work, if I might. Less to do with our foreign policy, more to do with regulations regarding his personal set of guards.\u201dThe direction of Ryden\u2019s office receives a mildly rude gesture and a stuck out tongue from Naoki. \u201cI\u2019m not pleased with him, to put it frankly. At this point, I\u2019m considering having him voted out of the office, and I suppose that\u2026 That whole matter is rather significant, isn\u2019t it...\u201d She shrugs. To her, the issue is relevant to the state\u2019s efficiency, her public image, and not much more. \u201cEnough of that, though,\u201d she says, moving in her seat to reflect the change in topic.Naoki sits on the edge of her seat, leaning forward to rest her elbows on her knees. \u201cThe children,\u201d she says, lowering her voice. \u201cTell me.\u201d", "1503542128000": "Naoki squints. Turns her head slightly to one side, raises an eyebrow. Is he not following? The leaning in and such, yes, unnecessary dramatic effect, but really? He probably doesn\u2019t, Naoki thinks. Either that or he\u2019s not very good at jokes; probably both. So she explains,\u201cYou are asking me to care for your children while you go do the things in the place. I will, happily. They will be as safe as they could possibly be. But is there anything that you would like to tell me about that? Like, \u2018This one doesn\u2019t like fruit' or, \u2018That one needs a particular stuffed animal to sleep\u2019\u2026?\u201dIn her examples, Naoki mimics his voice; it's not a bad imitation.\u201cThere must be a few things you can tell me. Warnings, peculiarities\u2026? Advice\u2026?\u201d She's fishing for something, at least. Ms. Higgs will definitely have this sort of information and Naoki is confident she could handle without, but it would seem wrong not to ask Alden. He\u2019s their father, for goodness\u2019 sake.", "1503616916000": "As Alden begins, Naoki smiles slightly, nods slowly. Here we go, she thinks.Without looking, she reaches over one side of her chair and fumbles a bit before finding a set of writing supplies stashed inside the table. Apparently, for just such an occasion. Setting quill to ink, she begins to notate all that he says, each detail to its own line in her meticulous curling script. She glances up and down between Alden and her notes as he continues, making her own comments off to the side, things she\u2019ll need to do in preparation, workarounds to be used\u2026.After he\u2019s finished, Naoki doesn\u2019t say anything or acknowledge in any other manner than setting the quill down. There are some four pages worth of notes now, and she places a hand to her chin as she looks between each in turn. The gears are turning very visibly; she\u2019s processing the information, thinking two, three, four steps ahead, laying her plans now. Her carpenters, for instance, will have their hands full shortly; Naoki doesn\u2019t have but any appropriately sized furniture and that will need to be changed very quickly. She\u2019ll need beds, chairs, tables, each of them will need their own room, everything must be monogrammed\u2026It takes her the space of a few moments to so much as recall that Alden is present and she should probably acknowledge him. \u201cAh. Yeees. Right,\u201d she says, though she\u2019s clearly not giving him her full attention. \u201cAnd, ahem. \u2026\u201dShe clicks her tongue, looks up to make eye contact and asks, \u201cWhenabouts do you intend to leave?\u201d", "1503678304000": "\u201cHmmh.\u201d A murmured acknowledgment. Naoki refers back to the notes as if checking the validity of his answer. She nods reluctantly, adjusting priorities to compensate.\u201cAlright,\u201d she says, \u201cAt least give me until tomorrow morning.\u201d One more night of rest, goes the unspoken continuation.\u201cAnd then, how would you like to perform the handoff? Would it be best for me to come pick them up?\u201d", "1503709756000": "Aug 25, 2017 13:16:37 GMT -8 Alden Marshal said:\"Well, I may have exaggerated. I'll be making final preparations as soon as I know where I am going. You'll have a day or two to prepare.\" Alden says with a chuckle realizing he misspoke slightly, giving the impression he'd drop everything and leave. \"As for the handoff...\" He trails off mostly because that is an odd way to refer to it. \"Whatever is convenient for you. Though I am sure the kids would love a carriage ride through the city in the Empress's own coach.\" Naoki nods, confident. \u201cThen a carriage ride is quite doable.\u201dWith the situation seemingly well in hand, Naoki takes a moment to blow on her notes, dry the ink. Once she\u2019s confident they won\u2019t smear, she stacks them up into a neat pile and sets them aside. This seems to serve as a sensible conclusion to the matter, and she nods again to mark the occasion.\u201cThey\u2019ll be in good hands,\u201d she assures Alden.", "1503715919000": "Aug 25, 2017 16:49:09 GMT -8 Grandma said:(Separate scene from current one)Above Naoki\u2019s desk, an impeccably clean white scroll materializes in a matter of seconds. The scroll floats down to land gently atop the desk, or what was already on it. The familiar sound of Grandma\u2019s voice addresses Naoki via the telepathy gem.The dragon Jarkoopi has signed the contract and the gem is in my custody. All you need do now is place a drop of blood or one of your hairs on the scroll and it will be finalized. Jarkoopi also wished for you to know he is willing to be of service to you when it comes to Runesmithing or simply being\u2026 A respectable combatant. I shall show you the gem in person at a later date, but until then I have it safely tucked away.Despite seriously considering otherwise, Lady Naoki is doing nothing more than reading a letter when this impudent scroll drops oh-so-rudely onto her person. For the space of a moment, she is irritated. To have the nerve to - but Grandma explains herself swiftly. Listening, Naoki nods to herself and slowly begins to smile. This is good; this will save everyone so much trouble. Almost eagerly, Naoki moves to unroll the scroll and give it a good reading through. Over the course of the next few moments, she does so, carefully scanning each line of the legal document laid forth. This is another excellent victory. The pen is mightier than the sword, as they say. She smirks. There\u2019s significantly more to it than that - it isn\u2019t as if she\u2019d just litigated the lizard out of existence or won some high-stakes battle of wits. But dragons don\u2019t write history books, do they? Not at this rate, they won't.Looking very much the cat that ate the canary, Naoki uses the point of a quill to prick the side of her finger. She is very still for a moment as a drop of blood wells up before dripping down to stain a spot at the bottom of the scroll.It\u2019s signed now, she thinks. One step closer. Excellent start to the morning, in any case. As Naoki moves to re-roll the scroll for filing, she considers taking the remainder of the day off in celebration. Could go have a picnic, perhaps.", "1503764281000": "Quirking an eyebrow, Naoki finds Alden's attempts more amusing than his intended joke. She doubts that he'll ever quite follow all the nuances of casual conversation, however many jokes he may make. If it were someone else it might be endearing, she thinks, though she thinks that in the fondest manner.\u201cYou would be one of the first,\u201d Naoki says as she moves to stand. Most of her \u2018social calls\u2019 happen elsewhere; the office isn\u2019t very comfortable. \u201cBut I\u2019ll look forward to it regardless. In the meantime, we both have preparations to attend to.\u201dAgain, Naoki opens her arms ambiguously, deflecting the choice to Alden.", "1507235732000": "Within, it seems as if Lady Naoki is seating herself behind her desk.

If you have something to tell me, sit down, introduce yourselves, and provide some context.\u201d With one hand, Naoki gestures toward the chairs in front of her desk.", "1507585380000": "Elected. That\u2019s the word for use in polite company, but Lady Naoki doesn\u2019t correct him - she\u2019s too busy enjoying the show. Both evidently feel far out of their depth. And, perhaps they may be, but that doesn\u2019t make it any less amusing. \u201cWell,\u201d Naoki begins, entirely straight-faced, \u201cAllow me to first applaud you, Leiron, for finding such a gorgeous dragon to make your partner.\u201dNaoki smirks slightly as she watches Asadobres\u2019 face for the reaction. After allowing a few moments, she continues, brandishing two fingers, \u201cSecondly, I don\u2019t throw anyone in \u2018jail\u2019; only dungeons, and even then, only after dinner. Though I would be willing to make an exception.\u201d Another smirk, Naoki is evidently enjoying herself.\u201cIt\u2019s also good to meet you both,\u201d she adds, almost as an afterthought.

She spends a moment to consider all of the greater dragons known to her, to Isra. It isn\u2019t an exceedingly long list, but there are enough to cause Issues, and there are most probably others that remain unknown. Isra\u2019s ability to handle aggressive dragons is reasonably good, Naoki thinks, she wouldn\u2019t be overly worried by any single dragon; but more than one at once and things would begin to get problematic.Naoki slowly nods as she responds, \u201cIf that is indeed the case, it could prove to be problematic, certainly. You were right to inform me, no one else has.\u201d\u201cI would be foolish not to take your word for it, so the first step will be to gather information. If it\u2019s a summoning horn, implies that you heard the summons.

After a moment, she finds what she\u2019s looking for and places it on the table.It\u2019s a stubby little cylinder seemingly made of gold. As it rolls across the desk, thread-like lines of blue energy flash across the surface, betraying the presence of carefully applied magic.\u201cThis is a scrying focus.

This is the same woman who, years ago, gave to her those exotic hides which she later had made into a cloak. \u201cA pleasure.\u201dThe mention of \u2018kordanite ore\u2019 draws a raised eyebrow from Naoki, her interest piqued. This, she\u2019s heard of. Heard of, but never seen, or so much as had the opportunity to procure - which speaks to the rarity of the material. \u201cYou have my thanks. I think my artificer will have first crack at this; he enjoys these sorts of things.\u201d Looking at the bag over the edge of her desk like one might peer over the railing of an animal enclosure, Naoki nods slightly. It can just sit there for a while - she isn't going to touch it.\u201cThese merchants,\u201d she continues, \u201ctell me about them. Where, when did you see them? Did they have more?\u201d", "1512174722000": "Riley Fletcher. Lady Naoki squints slightly at the mention. His name has come up twice, now, all the way up to her desk. Perhaps he warrants investigation. A consideration that Naoki files away for later.\u201cHmmh.\u201d Tapping one finger on her chin, Naoki considers. The Heroes Guild, she\u2019s aware of, as a minor entity that ought to be operating primarily in lands south of anything significant. Led by some woman with a sword for an arm, composed in large part of bandits. As a group whose primary demographic are champions of combat, it\u2019s potentially a volatile group, indeed. As is any gathering of warriors. If Naoki had less trust in her heroes, she might consider it more seriously, but today, it doesn\u2019t seem terribly capable of causing real problems.But. Naoki\u2019s gaze is drawn back to the bag on the floor. Depending on the realized power of Kordanite weapons -- Aia raises a valid point: they may become relevant. More considerations. \u201cHow much is 60,000 gold worth? How much did you pay?\u201d Lady Naoki gestures toward the bag.", "1512179674000": "Lady Naoki adopts an expression of mock disbelief and amusement at Aia\u2019s forwardness.

My next questions, \u2018Where are these merchants?\u2019 and \u2018Would you be willing to act cooperatively with an Imperial force of some description?\u2019\u201dA motion of Naoki's tail draws attention to the large map mounted on a side wall.", "1512446191000": "Lady Naoki nods. It would have to be a considerable force, yes. Ideally, a group of sufficient imposition to convince the merchants to surrender without bloodshed. It would be difficult and time-consuming to march anyone that far. Cavalry seems like the obvious answer, but alternatives exist, and Naoki decides not to make a decision right now.\u201cNot yet, though,\u201d Lady Naoki says, studying the map. Turning about on one heel, Naoki makes her way back to her desk.\u201cI\u2019ve alerted the relevant parties, but it will take them time to mobilize.\u201d She sits.\u201cBut for now,\u201d Naoki snap-points at Aia, fixing her with a look, \u201cYou.\u201d\u201cYou,\u201d she continues, \u201cHave managed to give me something significant I didn\u2019t already have -- twice, now. And then you\u2019re about to run off to assist in Imperial Affairs, despite having no obligations. I insist upon repaying you,\u201d she says. The tone of her voice, it seems as if she is, indeed, insisting.\u201cName, anything,\u201d Naoki says, clearly relishing the words.", "1512689982000": "As she listens, Lady Naoki adopts a thoughtful expression, unsurprised by the nature of Aia\u2019s response. She stands up to get a better look at the sword and studies the inscribed runes. As a reasonably well-read individual, Naoki has a rudimentary knowledge of rune magics and can understand some of what she sees. Only some of it, however. She thinks she\u2019s able to identify characters here and there, but her understanding is too limited to accurately \u201cread\u201d the inscription. Very interesting to study, though.After Aia is finished, Naoki takes a moment to think before responding, \u201cVery well! Easily done. At some point, you will visit The Tower and get acquainted with the army\u2019s clerical staff. They will set you up to function as an officer, and you will work with them to properly enlist your warriors. I am honored to have you stand with Isra in battle, but, as strange as it sounds to say, that is most efficiently done through the established bureaucratic channels. I will order the creation of new cohorts and put them under your command. One-hundred bodies to a cohort; we\u2019ll have as many as prove to be needed.\u201dReseating herself, Lady Naoki begins to shuffle through some of the papers on her desk as she continues. \u201cIf you would choose the role of General, so it shall be; your strategic command at any given moment would be based on the situation -- as is policy. Though, I would likely assign you all those Varan cohorts and however many more to form a full Legion, and task you with the protection of a region.\u201d\u201cAlternatively, you may choose to become a Centurion, responsible for the other ninety-nine warriors in your cohort and their tactical direction in battle. There are fewer administrative responsibilities associated with being a Centurion, and I present you with the choice.\u201d\u201cAfter that, we look into things such as specialized facilities and equipment. I would like all Isran soldiers in uniform, but I\u2019m sure every Varan has their equipment they would rather use. We\u2019ll find a compromise such that they\u2019ll look the part and be satisfied with it.\u201d\u201cAs for your runes\u2026\u201d Naoki trails off, thinking. \u201cI\u2019m going to send you to The Enclave with that. I\u2019m not sure who exactly, would be best suited to assist you, so I\u2019ll leave that to them. You might start with Daedalus, the Minister of Magic.\u201d", "1513278806000": "\u201cMmmmh.\u201d Lady Naoki murmurs her acknowledgment. \u201cVery well. Good day, general.\u201dResting her chin in one hand, Naoki considers Aia\u2019s back as she departs. There goes a dangerous woman. A woman of action, with the skills and status to follow through. She shares characteristics with others who already work in Naoki\u2019s circles. Aia will be a capable general, Naoki has no doubt.It will be interesting to see, Naoki thinks, how her story will pan out. If she would have herself as a loyal commander, Naoki will have her, and be grateful for it. But she\u2019s the sort of woman, Naoki thinks, who would lead a revolution just as happily. The type who would have her head without hesitation, given sufficient reason.In leadership and administration, subordinates are a necessary evil. The most challenging part \u2014 and the most critical part of leadership, Naoki thinks, is seeing to it that one\u2019s subordinates are well selected and properly tasked. Because \u2014 among other reasons, every bit of power one bestows can be turned against them. This is especially true in matters such as this, matters of soldiers and politics. History has proven this many times.Empowering Aia is a risk Naoki takes knowingly, with the intent to keep an eye on her, keep her where she can see her. Because if she isn\u2019t careful, Aia will develop into an independent actor with power, authority, and a following. The soldiers will not use their own equipment; they will use Isran equipment and look like Isran soldiers - because they will be Isran, soldiers, fighting for Isra. Not Varan soldiers fighting for House Heijra.The distinction is necessary, Naoki feels. The Varan, they will be Varan, certainly. Specialised. With shared heritage. But they will be Isran first. Their common background will not be used to distance themselves or draw lines. Their bond will be similar to the bond shared by soldiers from the same neighborhood put in the same cohort, not to that of contracted mercenaries. Lady Naoki will be keeping a close eye on this with the intention to prevent the formation of a subfaction. This is a one party government and it will remain as such. Such is her thought as she begins writing the relevant paperwork to see her next set of orders carried out.

She half-expects Venus to elaborate, but no answer is forthcoming. For the space of a few moments, Naoki sits quietly, resting her intertwined fingers before her on the desk.

The Inquisitors exist outside of \u2014 alongside, the traditional hierarchy. They are beholden only to myself, The Imperial Vizier, and their work: \u2018the security of The Empire,\u2019 however that may be defined.\u201dAfter pausing to dip her quill, Naoki continues. \u201cIt is a role that requires a great deal of discretion, which is why I think it may suit you \u2014 items such as sedition and insurgency are best handled as such. The Vizier will go into detail, but a large part of their responsibility is the management of information.

If she were to take the children on vacation, somewhere without security, far from Alden, that would be akin to presenting Pride with a silver platter.Does Alden not see that? Is she missing something? Why would he suggest such a thing? Is he suggesting that they hide? Is he playing it down in front of the children? Alden has never been easy to read, but Naoki is genuinely confused as to his thought process on this one.\u201cI see,\u201d she says, downplaying her fear in front of the children. \u201cIs there anything specific you would recommend, being more familiar with his methods?\u201d", "1549694810000": "Naoki frowns; that isn\u2019t what she\u2019d like to hear.

Does Pride seek to \u201creassemble\u201d The Set by capturing and re-indoctrinating Alden? Does he seek only to kill Alden because he knows too much? Is it as simple as revenge, or has she done something to prompt action? There will always be more questions than answers as far as this matter is concerned, but it\u2019s Naoki\u2019s thought that some insight as to Pride\u2019s motives may help inform their strategy.", "1549752713000": "Naoki nods along.

A great many entities of significant power would hopefully seek to avenge her, even aside from Alden. One can only be but so clever. Naoki supposes she won\u2019t find out, and that\u2019s probably for the best.\u201cIn any case, I\u2019m appreciative of the warning,\u201d she says, jokingly.

And you to handle the location.\u201dThough phrased simply, a significant look implies that \u201chandling the location\u201d includes selecting a safe location and ensuring it stays as such. Though it would be fun to visit any number of scenic areas around Isra \u2014 perhaps even a day trip to The Expanse, considering the last topic of discussion, Naoki would be perfectly content to have a picnic in such locations as The Citadel Courtyard, The Chalet, or Alden\u2019s backyard.\u201cI\u2019ll be taking suggestions,\u201d Naoki adds, though she suspects she knows what they\u2019ll be.", "1564709270000": "Sitting in her office on a rainy afternoon, The Empress is working her way through her inbox. Nothing of particular importance has yet come up today, and she\u2019s appreciative of that. No news is good news. Taking up the next bit of paper, it seems to be a correspondence of some sort.Exhalted Empress Naoki of the Isran Empire. We, the people of Libertalia, request an audience with the Isran leadership for diplomatic purposes. For too long have we stayed at arm\u2019s width, when both nations stand a chance to benefit one another. Since our nation\u2019s founding by Captain Francis O\u2019Malley forty years ago, we have watched from afar as the world has continued to grow around us, and we have been impressed with Isra\u2019s growth over the last twenty. We believe it is time to extend a hand to Isra and open our ports to your traders, so that we may both benefit from our very different nations.Libertalia recognises the reputation it and its people have gained among those on the open seas, one that may have rung true years ago; however, our nation and people are evolving beyond our original ill intentions as we bring ourselves into a modern era, an era with growing nations and endless opportunities, and we refuse to be left behind as many often do. We are no longer the band of pirates we once were, now we pride ourselves as a trade nation. Along with this letter, we have sent a gift to show our good intentions. Samples of spices from around the world, precious gemstones from the far south, and three barrels of Libertalian Ale, the finest on the open seas, all sold within our borders. We look forward to your invitation, and to expanding our relations with Isra and its people. Signed,Captain Joanne O\u2019MalleyThe Admiralty Council of Libertalia. By the time she\u2019s finished reading it, Naoki\u2019s eyebrows have nearly escaped her forehead; she doesn\u2019t know what to make of this. She\u2019s far from well-appraised as far as reputations on the high seas are concerned; her navy sails unchallenged as the largest and the finest; anything beyond that is below her notice. But if Naoki is reading this correctly, Captain O\u2019Malley here fancies herself the leader of \u2018Libertalia,\u2019 which she frames as a pirate den turned \u201ctrade nation.\u201d As such, she seeks a diplomatic audience with The Empress, such that they might negotiate some manner of a trade deal. Attached is a note from her staff that confirms that the letter did indeed come with the gifts outlined within.But without any further information, the credibility of this note seems rather suspect in Naoki\u2019s eyes. She is not at all attuned to gossip of the sea, and the names of neither Libertalia nor Captain O\u2019Malley have come across her desk in reports. And the tone she takes! Fluctuating between flattery, trying to pull the seniority card, and acknowledgment as a \u2018fellow\u2019 nation, it\u2019s difficult to discern what sort of position the Captain is trying to take. Shrugging internally, Naoki takes out a fresh sheet of parchment and begins her response.  Captain Joanne O\u2019Malley, If you would like to come to speak with me, please do. I can be found in The Citadel most weekdays, and usually meet with visitors in the afternoon.Nibbling on the end of her quill, Naoki considers what else could be said. There\u2019s nothing more she has to say or acknowledge. After considering it for a moment, she decides to conclude,Safe voyages, Signed, Empress Naoki of The Isran EmpireAfter looking it over to check for mistakes, Naoki nods to herself, satisfied. Placing her response together with the original letter in her outbox, she trusts that her staff will seal and send it back to wherever it needs to go.With that sorted, she reaches for the next item in her inbox. It\u2019s a report from The Offices of The Treasury Department, detailing the arena\u2019s quarterly finances. ... Naoki isn\u2019t quite sure which type of mail she prefers.  ", "1575614971000": "\u201cAh, Marchioness!\u201d The Empress sets her book aside and gestures for Helevisa to come sit in front of her desk. \u201cI have an assignment for you, though there\u2019s no hurry.\u201dEmpress Naoki waits for her guest to sit and get comfortable before launching into her monologue.\u201cStudying maps of The Empire, you may or may not recall The Duchy of Darrie. It is one of our relatively far-flung provinces, down around not so far from Meridian. Self-governing, of course, but a part of The Empire nonetheless. A taxes-for-protection arrangement, mostly.\u201d\u201cYesterday,\u201d she continues, picking up a piece of parchment, \u201cI received this letter, which I will now read to you. It is addressed to me, from \u2018Lord Corbin Crema, son of Lord Bertrand Crema and heir to Castle Crema and its surrounding lands.\u2019 Which is to say, Darrie.\u201d\u201cHe-hem. \u2018Please allow me to get straight to the point, and forgive my bluntness: my father has passed. He had been ill for years, but had been rapidly declining for the past several weeks and I sat with him when he breathed his last. My stepmother, Iliana Crema, had taken on the responsibilities of the lord, ruling the castle and the villages as long as my father laid incapacitated. However, after his passing, the stewardship of the castle should fall on my shoulders, as is my birthright.\u2019\u201dThe Empress gives Helevisa a significant look. Provinces like these are permitted to keep all their laws, save for those that contradict Imperial Law. And Imperial Law does not speak on succession.\u201c\u2018Unfortunately,\u2019\u201d she continues reading, \u201c\u2018My stepmother refuses to admit to his death. She has kept his body in seclusion, letting nobody see it and preventing my dear father from resting in peace. She continues to preside over the lands, claiming that he is still alive, but merely ill. Please, Empress, I beg of you to send an official inspector to Castle Crema. Officially recognize my father's passing, certify my position as lord of the castle, and allow me to inter him in the family mausoleum alongside my mother. I cannot bear the thought of allowing him to rot away in that locked bedroom for a moment longer.\u2019 \u2026 And he\u2019s signed it, \u2018Yours faithfully, Lord Corbin Crema\u2019\u201dSetting the letter aside, The Empress looks to the Marchioness. \u201cHardly my favorite sort of mail to receive, but it is a manner that must be dealt with. I believe that you will be well suited to the task, so you will be traveling to Castle Crema to address this issue in my stead.\u201d \u201cHowever,\u201d she continues, raising one finger, \u201cThere is no assurance that any of this is fact, and it is not so easy as that to manipulate your Empress. It may be such that Corbin is a conniving bastard who aims to take advantage of Imperial power to steal the throne. It may be such that Lady Iliana is a witch, that Lord Bertrand is alive but imprisoned, or that there is no Corbin, and this all is an elaborate play to obtain a hostage for ransom.\u201dOne palm up, The Empress offers a small shrug. She doesn\u2019t know.\u201cYou are being sent by The Empress to investigate, and hereby have jurisdiction to do as you please within the context of your investigation. Lay your eyes on Lord Bertrand, unless he has already been interred. The Empress would like to see her vassal laid to rest with the appropriate level of respect, and the people of Castle Crema should see it done, by her order.\u201d\u201cIf Bertrand is indeed dead, his successor \u2014 whoever they may be \u2014 must come to swear fealty to me here in The Citadel. ... It is worth noting: I have no categorical issue with Iliana Crema assuming control of the castle, and you are not being sent for the purpose of enforcing Corbin\u2019s \u2018birthright.\u2019 The local law ought to apply, but above all, the next ruler of Castle Crema will be both competent and loyal to their Empress. If there is a dispute between Corbin and Iliana, I will hear the case here in The Citadel and be just in my judgment.\u201d\u201cIs all of that clear enough so far?\u201d Empress Naoki asks, one ear askew.", "1575866050000": "\u201cI don\u2019t believe so,\u201d The Empress supposes, eyes skimming over the contents of the letter.\u201cYou have time to prepare, perhaps you depart tomorrow morning. I received this letter yesterday and haven\u2019t sent word back; you\u2019ll be arriving unannounced. Though you should take a few messenger beetles, and send me updates as appropriate.\u201dFolding the letter neatly into thirds, Empress Naoki places it into her \u201cout\u201d pile, to be filed away. \u201cIf you have no questions, I have nothing else to tell you. I thank you for your service, Marchioness, and wish you safe travels.\u201d With a curt nod of the head, The Empress dismisses Helevisa.When Helevisa is about halfway to the door, Naoki pipes up again. \u201cAnd be careful,\u201d she orders. \u201cSomething about this strikes me as off.\u201d", "1579926030000": "\u201cAnd your name?\u201d\u201cSimon Telmont, your highness.\u201d He moves to stand at attention, but lacks his weapon. The Empress nods, making note. \u201cAnd you survived.\u201dThis is stated as fact. The Empress looks at him over the desk and Simon swallows. Is he in trouble for that, or--\u201cI wish to hear about the attack,\u201d she continues. \u201cTell me about it. Take your time, and try not to sweat so much that it drips on the floor.\u201dThis prompts Simon to glow red with embarrassment and sweat even more heavily, but he launches into his story. \u201cWe were.. We were escorting the carriage, we always do, winding through the mountain passes, as you do\u2026\u201dThe Empress listens carefully, eyes and ears forward to follow the narrative as he tells it. Simon finds her scrutiny to be terribly uncomfortable but continues his tale. \u201c...And I said it didn\u2019t sound like no wolf, because I\u2019ve heard wolves and\u2026\u201d\u201c...and the bolts just bounced right off\u2026\u201d\u201c\u2026 and it bellowed: \u2019Surrender the gold!\u2019...\u201d\u00a0\u201c...then snapped it like it was a wee twig!\u201d\u00a0Simon goes on for some time but eventually comes to the end, \u201cAnd then it flapped a great big flap with its wings and took the entire carriage, horses and all!\u201d He pantomimes the flapping of wings for effect. The Empress murmurs acknowledgment. Putting a hand to her chin, she considers the matter. This is a new problem. In all her time, she has never heard of any green dragons in the Norkari mountains -- intelligent or otherwise. That means this one is either recently awoken or juvenile, and it didn\u2019t sound very juvenile.Lust for gold is common amongst dragons and requires no further explanation. But, she notes it was clever enough not only to selectively attack the tax carraige, but to attack on open ground, when the carriage was stopped, and do so at night, as to avoid Dawn Rider patrols. This attack was planned;\u00a0it would be fair to call it a heist, even.Taxes from the north only come in every quarter or so, on an irregular but not entirely unpredictable schedule. The next one won\u2019t be for a few months, so depending on how often the dragon feeds, it may or may not leave its cave for some time. Alternatively, it may grow bolder and strike out further. Taxes arrive in Isra from all of her territories, and they\u2019re all in more or less the same carriages. If it ventures any further out of the mountains it risks running into more patrols, but it would know that and plan accordingly. There\u2019s the matter of the endurance necessary to haul a carriage full of gold all the way back to the mountains from whatever road it is plucked from, but Naoki doesn\u2019t overthink it any further than that.This is a problem. A great big green, building-size, fire-breathing, heavily armored problem, that possesses human-like intelligence and also flies.\u201cHmmh.\u201d The Empress shifts in her chair to lean on the other side. Simon fidgets. \u201cOh!\u201d She remembers him and sits up. \u201cYes, yes, thank you Simon, that was very good. You serve The Empire well.\u201d He beams.\u201cYou\u2019re to take the next two weeks off and receive a bonus of, perhaps\u2026 250 gold. Remain in the city until further notice. Dismissed.\u201d She waves him away.Simon sputters his thanks, salutes, and makes for the door. With him gone, Naoki resumes her thought: a big green scaly problem...The first step is to post a notice. Something to the effect of \u201cA dragon has been sighted in the Norkari mountains. Travelers are advised not to travel north with large quantities of gold or other valuables.\u201d The people don\u2019t need to know that an entire carriage\u2019s worth of taxes were stolen, but perhaps such a notice will save some lives.The second step is increased patrols. More Dawn Riders near the mountains, especially at night, and watchtowers are to be on the lookout for shapes in the sky. Perhaps there\u2019s some manner of trinket or potion to see better in the night. Maybe she\u2019ll ask Daedalus about that at their meeting next week.The third step\u2026 The third step would usually be to hunt it. Hunting dragons is part of The Dawn Riders\u2019 heritage and there are dozens upon dozens of freelancers who have dedicated their lives to the pursuit. If she were to coordinate a focused, combined arms effort and leverage The Empire\u2019s full might, she could hunt down and kill this dragon, and potentially gain the riches of its hoard. She\u2019s been meaning to involve herself in more conflict and try out some of her new toys, and there are many who would enjoy such a hunt, herself potentially included.She could.But that would be effort, and that would be expensive. The lives of her people are infinitely more valuable than satiating bloodlust or flaunting her might. The dragon has not done enough to warrant such a response, and it would be poor form to send so many freelancers to their doom. (She still feels bad about the last time she did that.)No. Naoki shakes her head. If the dragon is so clever as all that and has decency enough to spare lives, she will attempt to liaise with it. The Fair Empress Naoki has a reputation to uphold and there is less to be lost in trying. If it won\u2019t negotiate, at least she will have tried. But how to do so...? It only takes The Empress a moment to decide.\u201cSend for Consul Finch.\u201d", "1580092804000": "\u201cYour next appointment, your highness.\u201d As is customary, the page delivers to The Empress the dossier of her next visitor. It would be a loss of face for her not to remember But this is not a regular dossier, Naoki notices, taking the scroll. This is stamped not with the symbol of the Archives, but that of The Sun Marshals, and sealed shut with their 'exceptional' wax. The pageboy takes his leave, and the wax dissolves upon The Empress\u2019s touch. Unrolling the scroll across her desk, Naoki looks at the name. Fiona Blythe Naoki squints. The scroll confirms what she remembered: this is the prostitute/thief she recruited with Alden some weeks previous at The Starlight Dawn. It says here that she has been submitting reports regularly and that she has distinguished herself as a valuable asset by enabling several \u201carrests.\u201dAfter spending a few moments to read the details, Naoki carefully rerolls the scroll and deposits it inside her desk. Why is Miss Blythe coming to visit her, she wonders? She has no business in this office and knows full well where she ought to be submitting her reports. Perhaps she has some issue she feels too sensitive to entrust to paper or wishes to ask a favor. This isn\u2019t the appropriate channel, but Naoki decides that The Empress will humor her regardless. \u201cSend her in.\u201d", "1580238998000": "The Empress sits with her hands folded before her on the desk as Miss Blythe enters the room and bows.

If you feel the need to speak directly to me as opposed to my most trusted Lieutenant... you may, seeing as how you\u2019re already here.\u201d She gestures for Fiona to proceed. ", "1580280268000": "Empress Naoki hums in contemplation. \u201cWell, the profane isn\u2019t very good, is it?...\u201dShe considers this information for a lengthy moment and then nods. \u201cVery well. Now that you\u2019ve reported it, other agents will be informed to listen for similar phrases. I will see about having this cache retrieved and investigated immediately -- our mages may be able to do something with it. \u2026 And make sure to give descriptions of the group and keep your eyes open in the event you reencounter them.

The names on the roster mean little to her for obvious reasons, but whoever put this together has obviously run a business before. Most of these estimations seem correct, and there are provisions laid out here for the things one doesn\u2019t consider during their first rodeo. No matter how much experience Fiona might have in other fields, Naoki would in no circumstance trust her alone with a business of such scale and ambition. The fact that she has a partner who already knows success makes the proposition plausible. Part of her doubts how much actionable intel such a venture could gather. Gossip, certainly, but Fiona must be either playing up or overestimating how useful this will be to Isran intelligence. She\u2019s doing it for the money, tying it to her role as an informant is just a means to that end in order to secure the support she needs. Fiona talks as if she has other options, but the only way that this happens is with The Empress\u2019s approval, and they both know that. The question is, will she give it? Naoki looks up from the blueprint to Fiona\u2019s eyes. The ambition is there, that much is clear. She\u2019s unsatisfied with what she has, and if this plan doesn\u2019t work out, she will try something else. \u2026 The next thing may not be as sound of a business plan.\u201cVery well,\u201d Empress Naoki acquiesces. \u201cI will support your venture, conditionally.\u201dUsually this is when she would start putting things to paper, but in this case Naoki merley mimics the motion of writing and mouths numbers aloud.After a long pause, she settles on the terms.\u201cI will grant you 150,000 of my gold to be used for the Violet Star, as is detailed here in your plan.\u201d Naoki slides the closed booklet back across the desk.\u201cYou will create quarterly copies of all financial records, including itemized receipts for all clients, and provide them to my agents when prompted, along with 18% of the net revenue, in gold, also quarterly.\u201d\u201cWe will both pretend that you did not insult me by offering a \u2018discount\u2019. ... Rather, you will remember who you are speaking to. If The Empress deigns to grace your establishment with her business, you will be honored and compensated fairly.\u201d\u201cAdditionally, the business will have a greater degree of ease in filing official paperwork, inspections, taxes, and the like.\u201d A vague hand gesture doesn\u2019t say that it will be permitted to bend the law, without repercussions but it also doesn\u2019t not say that.\u201cAnd,\u201d Naoki continues, clearing the other papers from her desk, \u201cAs the final term of the agreement, you will rest your cheek here, upon the desk, and remain there until I see fit to dismiss you.\u201d The portion of the desk Naoki taps is immediately in front of her, on the far side from Fiona. All of this is delivered the same curt, businesslike tone The Empress uses for such matters, deadpan and entirely serious.", "1580455536000": "Watching Fiona bend over for her, Empress Naoki claps her hands together and smirks a most devious smirk. \u201cExcellent.\u201dWhen she stands, the room immediately feels thirty freedom degrees warmer.\u201cYou see, I have another appointment in a few hours,\u201d Empress Naoki explains, circling around the desk, \u201cSo I only have time for something quick.\u201dOnce standing behind Fiona, Naoki wastes no time in flipping up the other's dress. It\u2019s very nice and all, but it\u2019s in the way. Taking Fiona\u2019s arms, Naoki brings them around behind her back and holds them there with one hand. Her other hand goes to Fiona\u2019s head, first to run her fingers through her hair, then to hold Fiona's skull down against the table. Both hands are warm, unnaturally so.Fiona ought to see where things are going at this point, and indeed, there it is. Gently at first, but only part-way before pausing. \u201cYou usually see only one client at a time, yes?\u201d There's a momentary pause, then there\u2019s a second (!) one, atop the first.\u201c...You will enjoy this,\u201d Naoki promises.And indeed, copious and perhaps even excessive use of lust magic would see to it that Fiona enjoys it quite a bit. An experience unlike any she may have had previously with any singularly-endowed individual, augmented by skillful application of the same variety of magic that make incubus so terribly good at what they do. Among the revelations of the day are the facts that the desk is bolted down, the office is sound-proofed, and Empress Naoki has a domineering bent. (Who would have guessed?)In the end, The Empress ended up being late to her appointment. She said that it took longer than expected to see that the terms of a negotiation were \"properly filled\".Fiona ought to think that a sum of 150,000 gold is fair compensation for her work, and would find the rest of the terms of her verbal agreement with The Empress to be carried out exactly as promised.", "1583632045000": "\u201cNo.\u201d The Empress overrides the order.

The Guard is trying, but ultimately unequipped, and now there\u2019s something going on at the Citadel Gate \u2014 someone is breaking in.Her actions in this moment dictate the course of history, but there\u2019s not enough time to plan or sit pensively and internally monologue. \u201cStand around the desk,\u201d The Empress orders, tone urgent. Reaching up to take out her earring, Naoki tugs once, twice, to pry the gemstone from its setting and casts the metal aside into a desk drawer. The gem, meanwhile, goes into her mouth, and a moment later, down her throat without a moment\u2019s hesitation.

Somewhere else, a crash, bricks falling. All of that is very troubling, Naoki thinks. Incredibly so. Then: Crack! The sound of thunder. Naoki winces involuntarily, unprepared for the loud noise. She recovers to see the doors swinging open and watches as a cloaked man enters. Behind him are Greed and Lust, just as Alden described. He must be the mastermind himself, and what he says confirms it. \u201cI facilitated the rekindling of the empathy you snuffed out,\u201d she confirms, standing. \u201cThat you would consider him as such bespeaks your own lack of same.\u201d The look of hate and loathing The Empress regards Pride with could melt Sunmetal.

For innumerable lives lost needlessly in pursuit of wicked ends, including those being taken all around her\u2014the lives of her citizens, at this very moment.

It ticks quietly and is then echoed by a far louder TOCK, echoing throughout the chamber as the magic takes hold.Through the greater part of The Empress\u2019s office, time slows to a stop. A trap\u2014the only one of its kind, devised for this express purpose. Her would-be kidnappers, Alden standing by them, and some of the Sentinels in front of her desk are frozen in time, such that it would seem to them the world around them would skip from the moment before the trap triggered to immediately after. Naoki, and all the Sentinels adjacent to or behind her desk, are unaffected.Usually, the protocol would be for her to leave, have elites handle the situation, and call Grandma. But Grandma\u2019s not here, so Naoki will take great pleasure in taking the matter into her own hands.Without pause or hesitation, The Empress stands and produces a huge red gemstone from somewhere on her person. Holding it out toward Pride, still many paces away over by the door, she glares at him as he stands there smugly in his cloak. The gem begins to glow.\u201cShe\u2019s not worth considering as a threat, she\u2019s just a soft bureaucrat,\u201d The Empress mumbles mockingly as she lines up the shot. The gemstone grows increasingly brighter in her hand, casting a harsh red glow across her armor and desk. Heat radiates out in waves, immediately melting the nearby candle and causing her hair to billow in the wind. He thinks he\u2019s so damn clever. \u2026 And he is, of that, there is no doubt. Pride\u2019s plan, the full extent of which she will never know, has done well to get him to this point. The fact that he was able to get this far and present the dilemma he has is highly concerning and will bring about changes to ensure nothing like it ever happens again\u2014of that Naoki is sure. The fact that Alden\u2019s children aren\u2019t under better guard is honestly a huge, very avoidable mistake on their part. But Pride isn\u2019t above mistakes either, and underestimating Empress Naoki isn\u2019t one he\u2019ll be making twice. \u201cToo merciful an end,\u201d she whispers. He won\u2019t even feel it.The noise is dreadful. A dreadful metallic ripping sound, like claws of hellfire tearing through the air as it were a chalkboard, accompanied by searing heat and blinding light as a beam of raw fire-aspected energy lances out from the gemstone in The Empress\u2019s hand to utterly destroy all that stands before it. It would likely sound very familiar to the handful of surviving Medanese refugees living in Isra, as it is the very same gemstone then-High-Lady Naoki condemned the Goraians for using in their coup and to repress their captive citizens. Repossessed by Grandma during the invasion, it now serves a far nobler cause. Thankfully, due to the height of The Citadel and the shot\u2019s level angle, there will be no mile-deep crater in Isra \u2014 only significant damage to The Citadel\u2019s walls. However, the incredible discharge of energy disrupts the time-trap, freeing those that remain. To them, it would seem the act of Naoki flipping off Pride erased the rotten bastard right down to the lower half of his boots. The Empress remains standing, a wicked grin on her face. The huge red gemstone is gone, replaced by an assortment of smaller ones held between her fingers. She isn\u2019t subtle about pressing more tiles with her foot, but this time the effects aren\u2019t as apparent. \u201cHaru is coming,\u201d she tells Alden, raising one hand toward Greed. \u201cThese two, then to your house, then the plaza for the last two.\u201dTo Torrin, \u201cThen deploy The Legion to retake the city.\u201d", "1593050292000": "The Empress has scarce little time to do anything but exclaim in surprise. The defenses, the tiles she pressed, why aren\u2019t they working? Then The Empress is flung backward as a result of whatever foul hex Greed cast. Up, over the top of the throne, all the way back into the window behind her, which has so wonderfully silhouetted her and provided light by which to work. Despite all the best intentions, heavily reinforcing that window works against Naoki in this case, as she hurtles toward it at some speed. The metal of her armor doesn\u2019t impact the glass, but The Empress\u2019s unarmored head produces a dull thud as it impacts the glass. She then falls to the ground, unconscious. Once the power source recovers from its disruption at the hand of the gem, the defenses activate \u2014 though far too late.There\u2019s a low rumbling from the ceiling as the stonework begins to move. On all the pillars up and down both sides of the office, the uppermost bulges upon which the ceiling arches rest rotate, revealing square holes about as large as one\u2019s fist. The crystal within each one begins to glow red. Though wholly unrelated to The Empress\u2019s gem, they produce a similar effect. Each one pivots to point at the nearest intruder and casts upon them a bright ray of hot, magical, and generally quite harmful energy. Individually they\u2019re not lethal, but there are some 30+ in all and they\u2019re very accurate. Armor and other protections serve to mitigate the damage but they\u2019re growing hotter by the second. The designer\u2019s and The Empress\u2019s intent in activating them is to blind and suppress, and to put a time limit on how long any intruder could remain in The Office. Perhaps they will serve to level the balance to The Set\u2019s detriment.", "1597288064000": "Naoki is unconscious and thus unable to do anything at all. Her mouth hangs open just a bit but she maintains enough decorum not to drool even in her stupor.", "1504823986000": "It\u2019s wearing on into the early stages of the evening as Lady Naoki enters The Conjunction. She comes seemingly unaccompanied, wearing at least one of her red coats. She moves, though not especially quickly- decisively, with great purpose. She\u2019s looking for Daedalus  with the intention of having a word with him. The Conjunction, she figures, is a good place to begin her search.Presently, she locates the door to his office. She spends a moment to read the lettering confirming it is indeed his office, and another to gather her thoughts before raising one hand to rap three times on the door.knock-knockknock", "1506275591000": "For a time, Naoki waits. She isn\u2019t so hypocritical as to demand his attention immediately. Her visitors often have to wait as well, especially if they come while she\u2019s blowing off steam, as it were. Perhaps Daedalus is doing the same. After two minutes, she knocks again. No response. After another three, she knocks a bit more loudly. No response. For a moment, Naoki considers having a go at kicking the door down. Not to kick it down, but to give it a good kick to set off whatever alarm mechanisms Daedalus might have in place. After a moment of consideration, she decides against it, as those mechanisms might very well be dangerous to the potential trespasser, and she hasn\u2019t got all day to be treated back to health. However, she also doesn\u2019t have all day to sit around this door. Turning her back on Daedalus \u2018s office, Naoki returns to The Conjunction at large in search of someone else.", "1523986830000": "Walking along, Kauri and Alden would eventually find their path terminate into a small sort of clearing setup with a table and some chairs. It is in one of these chairs that The Empress is seated. For this occasion, she has chosen to wear one of her staple sweaterdresses, and a book sits closed on the table. As they approach, Naoki spends a few moments to examine her guest. She was told that Kauri was a \u201cchimera,\u201d but that isn\u2019t terribly descriptive, and Kauri\u2019s dress isn\u2019t terribly revealing\u2014much to Naoki\u2019s dismay. Though she certainly does have a nice set of horns on her, doesn\u2019t she. And Naoki sincerely doubts that it\u2019s Alden with the clippity-clopping. This is mildly relieving, in that it doesn\u2019t seem as if Kauri requires any special accommodations. It\u2019s always awkward when one\u2019s guest doesn\u2019t fit into the chair. The bonnet with the horns is mildly amusing, but Naoki resolves not to comment on it.\u201cGreetings,\u201dThe Empress begins, rising from her seat. \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to meet you at last.\u201dShe extends one hand in Kauri\u2019s direction as if to be shaken. Alden receives a familiar smile and a small nod.", "1524103499000": "\u201cWell,\u201d The Empress responds, \u201cI wish to know of Paradise Island, and who better to ask?\u201dThe question is rhetorical, and after taking a seat, she continues. \u201cI\u2019ve received and read your written report, Alden, and it\u2019s certainly fortunate that the situation resolved as well as it did.\u201dOf course, the situation itself can hardly be described as \u2018fortunate,\u2019 but a significant number of people didn\u2019t die, and they didn\u2019t wreck her ship, so Naoki is counting it as a win.\u201cHowever, in the interest of effective governance, I wish to know more. I'm sure you can imagine. The discovery of something like Paradise Island is fairly significant as far as Isra is concerned, I'm sure you can imagine. To this end, I\u2019ve dispatched ships of The Expeditionary Force to investigate, but they have yet to return\u2014and, even when they do, they won\u2019t be able to offer the same insight as I imagine you can.\u201d", "1524186788000": "Naoki listens carefully, fingers pressed together, ears pointed forward. She listens carefully, and nods afterward, digesting the information.\u201cSo, if I\u2019m to understand correctly, there are\u2014or were, a significant number of individuals who became stranded on the island, yourself included. These individuals are those who have been brought to Isra. In addition, there are native tribespeople, as well as islands in the sky featuring \u2018bird-people.\u2019\u201dUp until this point Naoki had assumed Kauri to be a native and the island to be populated by others such as herself. Many questions spring to mind, but if Naoki been informed correctly, all of the rescued individuals were chimeras.The Empress opens her mouth as if to speak, but stops herself, looking for a gentle way to broach the topic.\u201cI would like to know more about your story,\" she says, hoping it isn't an uncomfortable topic. \"It seems like one worth telling.\u201d", "1524330454000": "Naoki comes to regret the manner in which she asked the question increasingly with each turn of Kauri's story. She\u2019s glad to have the information, and it does allow her to extrapolate much, but with some more thought, she probably could have obtained the same data without forcing the poor girl to relate her entire tale of woe.Afterward, The Empress allows a few moments to pass in respectful silence. \u201cThank you for telling me,\u201d she says, quiet. \u201cI will see to it that others avoid similar perils.\u201dOn what is hopefully a lighter note, The Empress asks, \u201cAnd what have you been up to in the meantime, after leaving the island?\u201dThe question isn\u2019t strictly relevant to informing her strategy, but it seems logical to follow and Naoki\u2019s curious.", "1524535102000": "\u201cOh. I\u2019m sure he has been,\u201d Naoki responds, jokingly reading into the statement.The idea that Alden is training Kauri is an intriguing one to Naoki, in that if he\u2019s doing so earnestly, she doubts that he\u2019ll stop until Kauri reaches a level that is satisfactory to him. And at that point, this nervous girl in the bonnet will be terribly, terribly dangerous. Watching that transformation will be interesting. However, considering the subject of the meeting, Naoki pauses for a moment to consider what information she has so far. It\u2019s a lot, but it\u2019s also not very much. Not enough to ground a strategy in, but enough to begin asking the right questions with. And though it seems like Kauri only knows but so much\u2014only what she observed casually, The Empress thinks there are still questions worth asking.\u201cFor the purpose of my curiosity only: Kauri. In the context of Paradise Island. If you were me. What would you do?\u201d", "1525027914000": "\u201cMmm, I see.\u201d The Empress nods empathetically. Kauri\u2019s answer is about what she suspected it might be, but telling nonetheless. She can\u2019t just leave it, of course. It\u2019s too large, too close. It\u2019s a matter of national security that The Empire be aware of exercise control over all territories in its reach. And though it may be best to leave dangerous lands well enough alone, Naoki must first know more of it. What groups inhabit it, what threat it represents, and how best to control it. If, after more thorough scouting, it becomes clear that the island should not be disturbed, fair enough, but leaving it unknown, unexplored, is not an option.Later, Naoki will ask Alden for his professional assessment, when he can give it plainly. She knows that Kauri\u2019s opinions will not color it, but the reverse may not be true.\u201cI appreciate the insight you have shared with me,\u201d The Empress says. \u201cIf at any point, I can assist you, please, do not hesitate to ask.\u201dIf Kauri is going to continue hanging out with Alden the odds of her needing something is low, but Naoki makes the offer regardless because doing the citizenry favors improves her approval ratings. ", "1525923833000": "\u201cIt\u2019s quite alright,\u201d Lady Naoki says, though at this point she\u2019s used to being taken so seriously. Extending favors of this sort has worked out fairly well so far, because what\u2019s Kauri realistically going to ask for? Nothing that can\u2019t be solved with a handful of gold, most likely, and spending a handful of gold for someone\u2019s loyalty is an easy deal to make.\u201cOh, I\u2019ll have to,\u201d Naoki responds. \u201cEspecially if you phrase it like that.\u201dFalling silent, she glances off to the side, striking a contemplative look. \u201cI need to figure something suitable to bring,\u201d she explains. With her nearly unlimited ability to procure unique and expensive items, finding something interesting to bring the children is part of the fun for Naoki, even though she knows they would probably be happy just to see her.Making a realization, she spins to point to at Kauri, \u201cOh, oh! Has she tried going for the horns?\u201d Glancing back and forth between the two of them, Naoki seems eager to know.", "1527291414000": "The Empress exhales sharply, amused. \u201cThe thought is entertaining,\u201d she explains.

Dresses like that aren\u2019t common; Naoki usually only sees them in her wardrobe.

As I began to expand, The Midnight Sun organization grew far beyond the staff of a bar. I struck a deal with a man named Calico Swartz to create The Sun\u2019s sister establishment, The Moonlight Eclipse. I invested in other businesses and created new profit streams, amassing influence and growing the organization. Eventually, I went to Lord Ildesias and requested appointment as the Minister of Finance, which he granted. Ever since then, I have held the purse strings.\u201dHere, The Empress gives Selene a knowing look.\u201cWhen Lord Ildesias resigned, I had enough influence to win the election over Then-Prime-Minister Tyrus Sepherian. ... Though some say I was ruling the city even before that. After election, I reorganized the government and installed my existing allies in positions of power.

Last she heard, the opposite is true; most guards and soldiers use spears, and genuinely skilled swordsmen are few and far between.

What then? What happens? What transitions would you need to make, how would you proceed from that point, and what thoughts do you have about that possibility?\u201d The Empress, having asked the basic questions, attempts to glean some insight on Madame Selene as they exist as an individual, into what sort of person they are.", "1538355807000": "\u201cMmmh,\u201d The Empress murmurs appreciatively, following exactly what Selene is getting at. That\u2019s her favorite bit about this whole thing: it\u2019s really just a glorified mechanism for individuals to offer her their bodies. It would be very much within the realm of reasonability to take Selene there where she sits, use her for the rest of the day, and then only debatably rude not to take her on as a consort afterward. And if Naoki is going to be honest with herself\u2014and if they\u2019re all going to be this attractive, that\u2019s what\u2019s probably going to end up happening with most of these suitors.But that\u2019s getting ahead of herself. Instead, The Empress adjusts herself in her seat and continues with what could be considered screening questions, taking Selene seriously.\u201cWhat about your family? You have any close?\u201d", "1538451186000": "\u201cAh.\u201d The Empress expresses what she suspects is the appropriate amount of sympathy. It seems like she\u2019s hit a sore spot, though she didn\u2019t intend to. If it turned out that Selene was a member of some royal or prestigious family, that would be worth noting. Similarly, if she had a husband or children, that might turn out to be a bit of an issue for them.\u201cThere are many I consider as family, but in the legal sense of the word I have only Princess Skarlet.\u201dFollowing this, The Empress leans back to think. She\u2019s almost out of questions, Selene is getting bored, and she hasn\u2019t yet reached a conclusion on her suitability as a consort.Because on the one hand, if it works out, if she is loyal, Selene would make for a superb consort, perhaps more. She is competent, attractive, and if she is to be taken at her word, a good lover. She would likely bear children with excellent traits. Naoki isn\u2019t looking for much more than that. However, though she says she is \"tossing her card in the hat,\" though she offers to be arm candy, her intelligence shines through; Selene is Smart. Smart, with enough ambition to have achieved her current status. Becoming The Empress\u2019s consort would be an excellent way to grow her power further. Her aspirations aren\u2019t clear, but \u201cthe throne\u201d is a common one. The means and motive for betrayal are there. But more than anything, she reminds Naoki of herself, in that though Selene would be an excellent screw, it would probably be Naoki getting screwed in the end. To accept Selene as a consort would be a high risk, high reward decision, and it\u2019s not one Naoki is going to make right now. Not until she\u2019s seen more of the options. To this end, The Empress nods and says, \u201cThat will do for now. You\u2019ve made a good impression; the duration of your pass will be extended, and you will hear from me in the future. It was a pleasure to meet you, Madame Selene.\u201d", "1539910036000": "Even after Selene takes her leave, Lady Naoki remains seated there in the gazebo, staring absently out into the garden. It\u2019s times like these that lend easily to self-reflection.This \u201cEmpress\u201d bit has its ups and downs, but she\u2019ll be damned if it isn\u2019t a rough ride. Though she wasn\u2019t enthusiastic about the idea of choosing a successor at first, the idea of all this being someone else\u2019s problem is appealing. The more days that go by, the better the old days look in retrospect. Naoki didn\u2019t appreciate Emahra as much as she should have at the time\u2014a ready-made successor delivered literally to her doorstep the first night of her reign. It was supremely useful to have such a competent right-hand woman and to be able to delegate tasks of importance to her comfortably. Emahra is likely happier back home than she would be here, but Isra is worse off for it.Naoki sighs and removes something from her eye. Then, it occurs to her. She can\u2019t do anything about Emahra, but you know who she can replace, is Fornillian. After consuming so much lust it became impractical for him to remain in The Overworld, so he returned to The Circle of Lust. That was years ago; it\u2019s been far too long since Naoki was on the receiving end of some good tentacles. The same ritual should work again, and there are probably plenty of spare tentacle beasts lying around down there, doing whatever it is they do in their spare time. Theoretically, it would be easy to just... ask for another. A plan formed, Naoki smiles to herself. Getting pounded insensate should help take her mind off things. With purpose in mind, she rises, and leaves the gazebo, headed back to The Chalet.", "1469207967000": "As the time of the meeting draws nearer with the ceaseless march of time, Naoki also marches- or perhaps, more accurately, strides into the Conclave chamber. Under one arm, she holds a small, otherwise unbound stack of parchment. As she approaches her seat, her eyes sweep the room and its assembled occupants, making eye contact with and nodding slightly to any who reciprocate.Without anything in particular to say before the meeting begins, Naoki slides her seat out, slides into it, and scoots back up to the table. Her sheaf of paper is placed with only a modicum of care onto the table before her. Weaving the fingers of one hand into the other, Naoki rests her elbows on the table and her chin on the interwoven fingers, waiting for the meeting to begin.", "1469783656000": "\u201cHm?\u201dShe glances up to meet Ryden\u2019s gaze as her name is mentioned, still apparently thinking ahead to the summit. It takes a half-moment for her to switch tracks, glancing down at the scrolls arranged before her.\u201cOh. Yes. I do, I have a matter to bring up.\u201dShe takes another half-moment to coalesce her thoughts, and form her primary train of thought for the small speech she\u2019s about to deliver. Presently, she begins, \u201cI have a man. Mr. Juan C. Ruben. One of Isra\u2019s more senior citizens. He\u2019s not a very charming man, speaking frankly. He\u2019s a bit of an addict, and that\u2019s an understatement. However, he is a brilliant architect, as well as a former Aaedanian.\u201dShe pauses for a moment, primarily out of respect for Aaedan, but continues shortly thereafter, her tempo increasing with each word, \u201cAs I was visiting The Sun the other day, he staggers down the steps and approaches me, one lense of his spectacles shattered, hair every which way, and smelling strongly of twenty different chemicals. He says to me, \u201cMa\u2019am, ma\u2019am, ma\u2019am, look. Loooook.\u201d Naoki\u2019s substantial talents of impersonation allow her to mimic the man\u2019s tone with an almost surreal degree of accuracy. The voice doesn\u2019t fit her at all, but seems almost effortless as she breaks it off abruptly and continues in her own speaking voice, \u201cAnd he proceeds to dump into my hands a crate, filled to overflowing with scrolls like these,\u201d she gestures to the scrolls sitting before her. There are five of them, rolled in a little pile, seemingly identical, each bound by a small red ribbon.\u201cThe undead are coming, ma\u2019am. They\u2019re coming. Comin- *hic* Coming to kill us allllllll\u2026\u201d and he reached over and snatched some poor woman\u2019s drink, downing it in a single go before continuing, \u201cThe walllllls. They\u2019re not e'nnugh! We need moah walls!\u201dShe even goes so far as to emulate the hiccup in the man\u2019s speech, lurching in her seat and gesticulating as he did to add a level of pantomime to her impersonation. \u201cAnd then he passed out on the floor, stone cold.\u201d With that said, Naoki proceeds to slide off one of the ribbons and unroll one of the scrolls, spreading it on the table before her. It depicts a building that seems strikingly similar to The Citadel, but significantly larger, and with heavier fortifications. Despite the apparent madness of their author, the plans themselves are immaculate, each line perfect to the point of seeming unnatural. \u201cHe\u2019s completed seven crates of iterations so far these so far, depicting The Citadel- both expanded upon and rebuilt, the city walls, watchtowers, outposts, forts, and probably other things too. I haven\u2019t looked through them all yet. Midnight is a powerful drug. He\u2019s probably revised his designs another crate\u2019s worth since I spoke with him this afternoon. And though I will be the first to admit that dear Mr. Ruben is stark raving mad, he does raise a point that I have deemed worthy of consideration. There are threats in this world. The recent catastrophe in Aaedan has established that. And while taller walls may not have helped in that instance, they most definitely would in others. Isra\u2019s fortifications- both of military installations and the city in general, are not all they could be. Not all we could make them to be.\u201d\u201cSome things are easy, such as replacing old guard-towers and seeing that the fortifications we already have are well maintained, and supplemented with the correct enchantments. I\u2019m not referring to those things. Such things ought to be considered standard. I\u2019d like to consider the notion of undertaking a larger project. I\u2019d like to consider the prospect of getting very serious with our static defenses, expanding the civilian, military and industrial-logistical infrastructure, and turning Isra into a fortress-city.\u201d As she speaks, she unrolls another scroll. Rather than the technical schematic of the previous scroll, this is more of an artistic rendition. It depicts the city of Isra from above and to one side, as if one is flying. The level of detail is incredible- each visible building is entirely accurate and depicted faithfully. A keen eye would be able to easily pick out such landmarks as The Ctiadel, The Midnight Sun, and other such landmarks. How he manages to do the shingles is anyone\u2019s guess. However, the most prominent features are the walls. Great, black things, stretching what would seem to be perhaps\u2026 a hundred? Two hundred meters up into the air? It\u2019s hard to say, the sense of scale is skewed. Regardless, massive walls, arranged in a pentagon around the city, broken at regular intervals by towers and topped with all manner of step-layered crenelations. It is truly a sight to behold, and after raising for all to see, she slides it along with the first scroll to the center of the table, to be viewed more closely by any who might choose to, either for practical reasons or ones of artistic appreciation. \u201cMy personal opinion is such that an operation of the scale I intend to describe will take years, and that we ought to start sooner rather than later. The treasury is in a fine state to support such a venture over the course of a few years, and in addition to the primary benefit of having the walls once they\u2019re done, building the walls will also serve to bolster the economy, creating a demand for jobs. Laborers, builders, supervisors, as well as all of the support staff involved in obtaining the materials and bringing them to where they need to be. I am in favor of the project, with the caveat that it be done carefully, properly, and not excessively quickly. I would like to bring this matter to the table, and hear any strong opinions held on it.\u201dWith that said, Lady Naoki slides back into her seat, finished speaking. Her eyes slide from left to right and back again, inviting any who might have a strong opinion to share to do so.", "1470157046000": "There it is again, that idealism. Such a troublesome concept, Naoki thinks. The practical value of walls is undeniable. Unassailability is a wonderful trait to have, and that fact cannot be argued. But here comes Cyronin, who ought to be perfectly aligned with her on this issue, beginning to purport ideas relating to how having walls will shape the city\u2019s image into one that doesn\u2019t align with the \u2018principles\u2019 it was founded under. Such a sumptuous point to make. The thought brings a small crease to Naoki\u2019s brow, but she otherwise dismisses her irritation as Akai'a begins to speak. As she continues, Naoki begins to nod. An expansion upon the idea of simply walls. An engineering project on an even more monumental scale, to include expansions to infrastructure and introduce the concept of layered construction. Technically, Naoki supposes that it isn\u2019t quite the most practical idea. Given the size of the Free Plains, and how staggeringly much land exists in a state conducive to building, it would be far cheaper to build outward. Wide, not tall. But there is, again, the idealism of \u2018a mountain upon the plains\u2019. A tower stretching up to the clouds is more romantically appealing than cityscape sprawling all across the countryside. And endlessly more intimidating, besides. Naoki nods once more in response to Akai'a\u2019s final statement, beginning to speak again, \u201cAn excellent idea. I\u2019ll return to Juan with these concerns and ideas, and see what all he can produce. At the next meeting, we can revisit this topic and review his designs- for the city as well as the port, and begin to form some proposals to The Assembly. With some defined goals in mind beyond simply defense of the city, I think he\u2019ll be able to produce something we\u2019ll all find satisfactory. Unless anyone has anything further to offer, I think we ought to table the topic for the time being.\u201d", "1470562280000": "As Akai'a states her proposal, Naoki nods slightly in her direction. Naoki wasn\u2019t aware that the city\u2019s existing sewer system was inadequate- she had never noticed or been told of any issues with it. But it also isn\u2019t her job to be aware of such things, so fair enough. What Ryden has to say about it is about all there seems to be to say about it, though. Seeing as how he phrased his thoughts correctly- as a suggestion, she has nothing further to add. She shrugs noncommittally at Ryden\u2019s request that Juan be brought to the next meeting. She resolves to give it a token effort, but, being familiar with the drugs in question, sincerely doubts that any manner of rehabilitation would be effective. She would simply end up explaining that at the next meeting. As Ryden continues, however, an expression of mild bemusement makes itself present on Naoki\u2019s face. She waits for a moment, listening to what Valerian has to say, but interjects with her inquiry after Ryden has finished fielding his question. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ve adequately articulated what you\u2019re getting at here, Ryden. I don\u2019t understand your proposal. If an individual accomplishes something noteworthy, it makes sense to recognize their noteworthy deed officially, and perhaps with some manner of ceremony and ornamentation. I\u2019m with you that far. But- and perhaps I\u2019m missing something here- but what would be the point of having an \u201cOrder of Merit\u201d as opposed to say, just a ceremony and a medal? What would the Order\u2026 do? Where\u2019s the practical merit in maintaining an \u201cOrder of Merit\u201d? ", "1495280592000": "Lady Naoki enters from the rear of the room without fanfare. As she moves past Zemp toward her seat at the opposite end the table, she finds it somewhat pleasing to note that everyone has arrived in such a timely manner. Everyone who she expected to be able to attend, at least. Those who are unable to attend will receive a report on the contents of the meeting about to happen a few days later.Settling herself comfortably back into her seat, Naoki rests her elbows on the table and places her chin atop her interwoven fingers. With an expression a bit more smug than is standard even for her, Naoki nods across the length of the table toward Zemp, suggesting that he begin.", "1495519821000": "Speaking up to address the question herself, Naoki remains in her seat and looks to Fairuz as she responds, \u201cThe Duchess would be unable to assist you with such a matter, as topics associated with the aftermath of our victory are being handled by my staff, including that of confiscated weapons and property.\u201d\u201cI have not been briefed on any information relating to property seized from Sakand by the Goraian administration. However, as far as I\u2019ve been made aware, none of the items that were left in the Goraian vaults seemed to have come from Sakand, and all hazardous magical items confiscated from the Goraian Ministry of The Arcane have been locked safely away as per protocol- to avoid any potential issues caused by their misuse or theft.\u201d\u201cAs such, I doubt it will be possible to see the return of the artifact you speak of.\u201d \u201cHowever, if there is some manner Isra can assist in improving the welfare of Sakand\u2019s population in which it is not already, this table would be eager to listen.\u201dGesturing, Naoki indicates the assembled Conclave members sitting down one side of the table. As alluded to by Zemp, the entire Conclave will be able to work in all territories of Isra.", "1496272829000": "Drawing in a breath, Lady Naoki holds it for a moment before exhaling with a small huff. \u201cYes,\u201d Naoki says, flatly. After a momentary pause, she continues, \u201cI am also stating that all magical items taken from Goraia will remain in storage for the time being. It would be exceptionally foolish to risk another catastrophe like the one that took place in Stonevale. The power source of the Tallak ak Ara has been stolen, what, twice now, in living memory? Enough blood has spilled already; the gem will remain where it is.\u201d Despite any feels of tension, Naoki seems outwardly unperturbed. She has simply made a statement, to be heard and heeded.", "1496681897000": "In listening to what Fairuz has to say, Lady Naoki sits quietly with her arms folded on the table. At Fairuz\u2019 closing comparison, however, her head tilts slightly to one side, and her eyes open slightly wider as she looks down the table. To liken Isra to Goraia is, Naoki feels, tantamount to an insult of the highest order, exceedingly disrespectful, and uncalled for besides. If perhaps, Isra were imposing on Sakandi sovereignty in some way or doing anything more than refusing to relinquish such a powerful weapon, such remarks may perhaps be understandable. But in this instance, the line has been crossed from jabs in debate and outright attacks. With this, Naoki is none too pleased. \u201cAllow me to apologize, Emira. I had forgotten that you were installed by the Goraians; it only stands to reason that you wouldn\u2019t be able to see the difference, and I was wrong in thinking you could. One difference is such that Isra has not supplanted the leader of Sakand with one more respectful and cooperative, yet.\u201d Though Naoki\u2019s tone remains calm and steady, one may be able to hear the sarcasm as it drips from her words. \u201cAnother difference is found in how under Isra\u2019s protection, Sakand has been free to institute reforms with no superseding interference, trade and liaise with the world without restriction, and do so without danger of starving, being attacked, or the next victim of a coup.\u201d Without dropping a beat, she continues, \u201cI had also forgotten about the heroic hardships undertook the heroes of Sakand in holding Duchess Camilla captive and forcing her to release the gem from its original protective enclosure, where it was sealed to prevent its potential use as a weapon of terror.\u201d \u201cHow, could I, have forgotten, that.\u201d Though she feels it would be appropriate to reiterate the fact that the gem will stay where it is, and perhaps set up some alternate course of action or at least discussion, Naoki stops here. The corners of her mouth drawn back and eyebrows raised, she would like to see what all The Emira has in response.", "1496965747000": "Naoki scoffs. \u201cI certainly wouldn\u2019t like to. You\u2019re the only one who needs to be told that saying mean things isn\u2019t going to get you anywhere you'd like to be. I would even go so far as to say, in a setting such as this\u2026\u201d Raising her arms, Naoki gestures down the table toward the others seated. \u201c...It would even be\u00a0counterproductive to your goals- a bad idea.\u201dAfter allowing a half moment for that statement to hang in the air, Naoki continues, stepping back to address Fairuz\u2019 question. \u201cThe gems once belonged to Duchess Camilla\u2019s ancestors. The one we are concerned with now was locked away with an enhanced chest that only permitted descendants of the original owners to open it. I call attention to this and the method by which it was removed from that chest with the intention of noting that Sakand\u2019s claim to ownership is no more legitimate than any other.\u201d", "1500765533000": "\u201cMmhmh.\u201d Lady Naoki acknowledges Faiuz with lips pressed together and a small nod. Listening to Fairuz conclude her argument, Lady Naoki sighs inwardly. An unfortunate conflict, this. Unfortunate in so much as she had hoped things would work out better between the two of them, between Isra and Sakand. Fairuz raises a valid argument, Naoki admits to herself, and were she in the same position, she would probably have acted similarly. But it would have been better was Fairuz not so insistent on this point, of all points. On other topics, Naoki thinks, she would be willing to compromise.But there isn\u2019t much to be done about it at this point. This is, after all, the first generation, the first year. They\u2019re still using the word \u2018occupation.' It would be unreasonable to expect loyalty so soon. Relations ought to improve as time goes on, and perhaps Fairuz could be placated later.\u201cIn any case, I would like to hear now from the Ministers.\u201d A significant look is directed toward Robert Fletcher  and Ganymede Galaii  . From him, Naoki expects an update on his initial assignment and any plans of his he might want to be funded. From Ganymede, an update on what she\u2019s been up to in the wake of Prospernaila, and perhaps some information on what she intends to do next.", "1500928347000": "Lady Naoki shakes her head and makes a dismissive gesture. \u201cI don\u2019t want paperwork. I would like\u2026\u201dShe continues explanatorily, \u201cto know what you are doing. What you\u2019re up to, and if you have anything in particular planned- ideas. Anything that you might need funding for, or need in a more general sense.

For the space of a few moments, all is silent. One fuzzy ear twitches.Then she continues, \u201cWell. When you would like some gold for that, do let us know.\u201d\u201cUntil then,\u201d she rounds on the next subject, \u201cRobert! What about you, what do you have for us?\u201d", "1502504777000": "\u201cMmmh, yes, please.\u201d Lady Naoki gestures to Miss Booker to bring the papers to her. For a few moments, Naoki stands in consideration. The expeditions are of no particular importance to her. A good process to have, surely, but until anything comes of it, it deserves little focus. Though this 'issue' deserves sorting out. She considers sending someone - someone powerful. Zurt it doing little save for standing ready, but, Naoki thinks, she prefers him that way. When the time comes for using a seven foot tall, millenniums-old metal tentacle killing machine, Naoki will not be caught without - of this she is sure. Arya would most likely go willingly, given the opportunity. And she would likely resolve the botheration superbly. But- Naoki figures not, for similarly tentacle-related reasons.\u201cTo your expedition,\" Lady Naoki speaks, \"I will send a Sun Marshal. Perhaps a few. I should like to know what all has bested four of our expeditions and their assistance will be appreciated, I\u2019m sure. They will go themselves, and they will go with orders superseding yours; so no action is required on your part, Robert.\u201dIn considering, Naoki thinks, the farms and mines are of little import. For him, Of Primary Industry, essential. But to her not much but good news.And Whaling. Whaling\u2026 may be against the terms of the agreement signed years ago with that \u2018Queen of the Ocean\u2019 or however, Naoki thinks. But. Probably not. And if that 'Queen' has some issue to raise, let her raise it, Naoki thinks! Let her raise it, and we will send someone for her when she does. The corsets are a bonus. They\u2019ll be available more widely, to more than just the wealthiest citizens. Which is an excellent development, as Naoki doesn\u2019t mind women in corsets, not one. bit.\u201cOn all other counts- good work, I appreciate what you\u2019ve done.\u201d To Robert, a suggestive smile, and a nod. To dear Miss Booker, a brief teasing smirk.Naoki at this point refers to her notes, checks something. Over the top of her record book, she asks, \u201cAnd, what of the future, Mr. Fletcher? What are you working on? What do you intend to do?\u201d", "1504391719000": "\u201cMmmh,\u201d Naoki murmurs her acknowledgment. To be fair, Naoki thinks, she didn\u2019t know what she expected him to be working on. But she did expect him to have something in mind. She thought he might bring up that one thing of his - the project he mentioned during their first meeting, that she told him to sit on.\u201cAlright,\u201d she says, taking a moment to adjust her hair. \u201cFair enough. I\u2019ll expect more reports as you make progress. I\u2019d like you to continue thinking on a large scale, beyond just Isra, and keep me posted on these Expeditions.\u201d Naoki punctuates her last sentence physically, tapping the table with her finger to embody the period.\u201cI don\u2019t have any further questions,\u201d she says, with the intention of allowing everyone the chance to bring something up before the end of the meeting.", "1562726755000": "Though notes carried by messenger and the word of her very own mouth, Empress Naoki has invited a collection of individuals to a meeting in the Conclave Chambers. They include, of course Grandma     , who attends all such meetings, as well as:Lord Arthur Perceval   , head of The East Isran Trading Company     , Centurion Analiese Hael     , Centurion of The First Cohort,Lady Cassandra Winter     , scion of House Winter,A representative of The Expeditionary Corps;And her Consul, Elizabeth Finch     , who is already aware of what will be discussed but attends for the details.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A map of the known Overworld is spread across the table, and The Empress is already seated in one of the high-backed leather chairs. She greets each as they enter, and once all are assembled, she stands and begins to speak.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAs you all are now aware, the continent of Toragana lies off to the northeast, some distance across the ocean. It is in many ways similar to The Expanse, in that it is a huge swath land that is all but unsettled, ripe with resources and, as of yet, unclaimed.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt is inhabited,\u201d The Empress admits, \u201cBut only by a handful of nomadic tribes. Lord Perceval and his Trading Company have had some amount of luck in trading with one of these tribes, and the princess of another attended The Summit. (She was pleasant enough.) The tribes are far from savages, but they\u2019re also not anything even remotely resembling a nation. They are to be considered, certainly, but they do not preclude Isra from colonizing Toragana.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBecause that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing!\u201d Empress Naoki announces with a degree of enthusiasm, \u201cIsra is to establish a colony on Toragana, and you will be the ones to do it. That\u2019s what this meeting is about.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After clearing her throat, The Empress continues.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\"I will elaborate: I believe it to be my duty not only to tend to Isra but to grow Isra. Not just stoke the metaphorical fire, but also give it wood.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cI have been\u2026\u201d The Empress makes an indistinct gesture; they already understand. She refers to how virtually everything, including their homes, jobs, and even the clothes on their back, would not exist if Isra never grew beyond The Free City, if not for Her.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd I intend to continue,\u201d Empress Naoki says, \u201clest Isra stagnate.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After pausing to arrange her thoughts she continues. \u201cUnderstanding that established colonies are good to have and bearing in mind that there aren\u2019t very many landmasses out there in the ocean, Isra will establish a colony in Toragana. The East Isran Trading Company will spearhead the effort,\u201d she says, pointing to Perceval, \u201cBecause they already know how to and have experience establishing small outposts. It is best that there be as little bureaucracy as possible while the colony is so small, so to begin the process, The East Isran Trading company will build an outpost on Toragana, just as they have elsewhere.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWhen it comes time to begin construction of the city, the authority will gradually transfer from the Trading Company to the colonial government \u2014 which will exist by that point. The colony will, as it is built, become the governor\u2019s responsibility, and Lord Perceval will return to his normal duties.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cUntil that point,\u201d The Empress continues, \u201cLord Perceval will be responsible for it.\u201d A long pause to let that settle.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cBut I\u2019m getting ahead of myself. Before we can settle, we must first choose a location to settle, and, in an ideal world, we would have maps of not just the area surrounding our colony, but the entire continent. That is the role of The Expeditionary Corps.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The Empress addresses their representative: \u201cPlease mobilize your cartographers to map Toragna as quickly as you safely can \u2014 the cost doesn\u2019t matter, the sooner it\u2019s done, the better. Because the information we have now essentially amounts to this line.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Pointing at the map, Naoki indicates the imprecise representation of Toragana\u2019s coastline, which is essentially a single curvy line. Mountains are drawn on part of it, but that\u2019s all that could be seen from the water; the inside of the continent is blank.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cIt\u2019s a land of potential, but also a land of unknowns.\u201d Solemn, \u201cWe will be making decisions based on incomplete information. There will be many things we\u2019re not going to know until we do, and some of those may lead to bloodshed.\u201d A pause.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cAnd,\u201d she continues, \u201cFor as morbid as it sounds: if there\u2019s going to be bloodshed, it ought to be handled properly, by someone who knows what they\u2019re doing.\u201d With a gesture, Naoki points to Analiese. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cCenturion Analiese Hael. You will go to Toragana as part of the colonization effort to ensure that our settlers are well protected and to maintain order in Isra, as it will exist over there.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou will generally be secondary to the commanding officer,\u201d Naoki continues, indicating Percy, \u201cand in essentially all situations I would, of course, prefer that the two of you cooperate. But... if you feel the need to act in defense of Isra, do so. I hereby grant you special authority to act in any capability pertaining to the protection of Isra and its citizens, within the context of the colonization of Toragana.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Having said that, The Empress is quiet for a moment. Her eyes skim across the map and then around the table \u2014 until they settle on Cassandra. \u201cAh, Lady Winter, probably wondering what your role in this could possibly be. In short: I\u2019ve been looking for something appropriate for you, and this may be it: you might make for a good colonial governor.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cWith the stress on \u2018might,\u2019\u201d The Empress adds, quick to continue, \u201cI don\u2019t yet know you well enough to say for certain, and of course it would be an offer as opposed to a posting. But you seem to be the best available option, and so I thought it prudent to have you here at the very beginning. \u2026 So I don\u2019t have to explain it twice. We\u2019ll speak later.\u201d After giving Cassandra a very particular look, The Empress sits. That\u2019s all she has to say.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cQuestions?\u201d There should be questions.", "1562947297000": "The Empress nods in response to Grandma\u2019s second suggestion. \u201cIt\u2019s a good idea to have Zurt accompany Lord Perceval, please arrange for that.\u201d \u201cBut I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any sense in deploying golems this early. We\u2019ll send one, perhaps two, in the event that something needs doing and Centurion Hael would rather not risk her men, but this isn\u2019t a military strike, and it shouldn\u2019t look like one. They\u2019ll be defending a construction site and then a small village; the soldiers will probably spend most of their time assisting with construction. To send heavy golems at this stage would be overkill and seem highly suspect.\u201d\u201cCenturion Hael, I trust that once you arrive, you\u2019ll send for any sort of reinforcement you feel necessary, but unless you think otherwise, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s space for more than one or two golems on the first wave of ships.\u201d A quirked eyebrow suggests a question; The Empress is asking her opinion.", "1517349954000": "Empress Naoki\u2019s boot squelches audibly in the mud as she takes the final step down from her carriage. She grimaces. Evidently, it rained last night. Taking a few trudging steps away from the carriage, she surveys the area. The last two hours were spent riding out to the outskirts of The Free Plain, beyond the farthest farmer\u2019s field, only a half mile or so from the edge of The Eastern Woods. There\u2019s the treeline, just over there, and miles behind her\u2026 there\u2019s the city, looking highly impressive. Lady Naoki is all the way out here for a meeting. The week before last, she was approached by a raven emissary belonging to none other than Trogdor , the red dragon. His dealings with Isra have been ambivalent at best, but Naoki harbors a private grudge against Trogdor on account of an incident some years ago, wherein the scaly cretin was bold enough to bare its fangs against Kate, of all people. It didn\u2019t have a chance to do anything more\u2014Grandma gave it a scolding. Since that day, it has never dared return to Isra. Smartly so. But now, the dragon wants to talk. About what, the raven wouldn\u2019t specify in any great detail. But The Empress, benevolent as she is, agreed to humor him. Understandably, he wasn\u2019t keen on coming to The Citadel, so her terms were clear. They will meet at this location (of her choosing) near The Eastern Forest. Trogdor is to come in a human form, and is not to try anything that might be construed as \u201cfunny.\u201d In the name of honorable diplomatic policy, as so long as he complies, he will not be touched. The alternative goes without saying. To that end, Naoki turns to glance behind her, back at the carriage. ", "1517622061000": "Lady Naoki stands quietly as the dragon approaches, hands held behind her back, rocking slightly on her heels. Eyeing him, Naoki\u2019s first impression is that he looks\u2026 irritable. She isn\u2019t entirely sure what she was expecting, but Naoki would be lying if she said that she wasn\u2019t hoping for something with a bit more\u2026 muscle? With a better jawline, maybe.But no matter. Dismissing such notions, Naoki assumes the stance of The Empress. One hand in the other behind her back, a squaring of the shoulders, and a slight upward inclination of the head (as to better look down her nose). Even all the way out here, ankle-deep in mud, The Empress commands the same presence she might at the head of a Legion or on the throne.She listens.\u201cYou do me great honor to bring such a powerful mage as your escort.\u201dGlancing sidelong at Jun, The Empress smiles just slightly. The dragon would see her as a dragonslayer, wouldn\u2019t he. That wasn\u2019t necessarily her intention in asking Jun to come, but it works. If that\u2019s all it takes to intimidate him\u2014Jun, perhaps she\u2019s been giving Trogdor  here too much credit, Naoki thinks.Continuing to listen, he loses her. Prophesied to make\u2026 who, stronger, exactly? He's got some sort of baggage, but the details are beyond her\u2014as is whatever he\u2019s driving at. She figures it unimportant. Perhaps Jun will explain later.The Empress refrains from any edged comments regarding the concept of his making \u201cdemands,\u201d and asks only, \u201cWell, what is it?\u201d", "1517973438000": "Listening, The Empress stands stock-still, displaying her carefully curated neutral expression. When Trogdor is finished, she blinks, and the end of her tail flicks once.\u201cMmmmh.\u201d She murmurs acknowledgment. Tilting her head slightly to one side, she places a hand on her chin, considering.It is undoubtedly a proposition he\u2019s gone and laid out. The only reason she doesn\u2019t dismiss it out of hand is due to Trogdor\u2019s potential value as an asset. He would be a very pretty feather in The Empress\u2019 figurative hat. Pretty enough for her to humor his request, at least.However, she isn\u2019t about to make a decision that isn\u2019t in The Empire\u2019s best interest just to buy the spurious loyalty of some dragon. And to make a well-informed decision, she requires information. This is a matter she would much rather discuss civilly, maybe over some tea. Somewhere where her life isn\u2019t being threatened, perhaps. But for some reason, she doubts the dragon has patience enough for that.But she\u2019ll not be rushed into a hasty decision! She\u2019s The Empress, and if the dragon\u2019s composure is as fragile as that, that will be his problem. She\u2019s aware of his nature and will attempt to accommodate as much as is reasonable, but if he can\u2019t handle a conversation with her, he certainly can\u2019t handle an entire city, she thinks. Breaking her silence, The Empress issues to Trogdor the foremost of her questions, \u201cWhat would you do with such authority as that?\u201d", "1518228963000": "Trying to pull the pity card might have worked, had the subject been something else. As Lady Naoki does not give a single iota of a shit about camps of vermin out in the wilderness. If they earned the ire of some dragon and died for it, that's\u00a0their problem. Things like that happen in the wilderness\u2014it\u2019s the wilderness. The circle of life and death continues. Unfortunate, perhaps, but not at all within the realm of her concern.Perhaps they shouldn\u2019t have tortured the human. That didn\u2019t work out very well for the whoresons who abducted Arya, did it? And perhaps Trogdor should have chosen his words more carefully as not to imply he would like to give such filth a place in her city!The Empress\u2019s duty is to her Empire\u2014to its citizens. That includes those living in Stonevale. Regardless of anything and everything, Stonevale is a city of The Empire, and she\u2014The Empress, is responsible for its care. Lady Naoki's ultimate priority is the defense of The Empire. Millions rely on her, and the continued success of her leadership. Say what you will about her, but at the very least, she\u2019s a slut with a sense of duty. And undeniably, ability enough to make it as far as she has. And to The Empress, the idea of intentionally creating a thieves\u2019 city\u2014a smuggler\u2019s port, perhaps even a stronghold of evil, is beyond laughable. So bad as to be beyond the point of being amusing for how bad of an idea it is. The only reason she would consider valid for gathering all the world's criminals in one place would be to be rid of them all at once.It seems to her as if Trogdor\u2014assuming that the coin is as valuable to her as it is to him, is overestimating how much bargaining power he has, overestimating how much trouble unorganized barbarians are to The Empire, or else severely misunderstands human society. She suspects all three.Though she can hardly blame him. He\u2019s a dragon; it\u2019s his nature. Just as you cannot blame the bird for flying. He's hardly the first person to come clambering for a piece of her power, and she'll be the first to admit: she's terribly enticing.She speaks politely, without inflection; there's no reason to rouse him. \u201cI see, ... And what of the population of Stonevale?\u201d ", "1518448984000": "In considering the matter from multiple directions, The Empress stumbles upon one important fact. He is a dragon. And he, as a dragon, doesn\u2019t know human social cues or etiquette. He isn\u2019t paying attention to the way she moves her head or the direction in which her feet are pointing. He\u2019s a dragon. She doesn\u2019t think him incompetent in such matters, but it doesn\u2019t make sense to treat him as she might a human.She\u2019ll likely get farther, she thinks, with explicit statements and straightforward negotiation.Though, his proposal is still absolutely absurd. What he\u2019s inferring now is slavery. He dresses it up, but it\u2019s slavery and not in any way considerable. Satellite states such as The Duchy are given much leniency to have their own laws and govern themselves. However, slavery is one of only a few things that are explicitly forbidden by Imperial Doctrine. It seems to her as if he\u2019s been thinking about this for a while and has all manner of grand ideas packed in.\u201cWhat you propose is more than I am willing to agree to so quickly. Your plan is ambitious and would affect much. There are too many things that cannot yet be known for me to decide for my people in good conscience.\u201dShe attempts to backtrack. \u201cI believe we would do well first to reach a smaller agreement. You wish for power in the form of a city, and I am not averse to the concept. You offer gold, and I say politely: keep your gold. It is worth more to you than to me.\u201dAssuming he hasn\u2019t yet blown his top, she continues. \u201cWhat I am interested in is your power. I agree that there\u2019s much potential in an alliance between us, and before proceeding much further, I would like to discuss the terms under which we would be allied.\u201d An appeal to his ego.

It was brought to her attention during her postwar trip to Stonevale.

It certainly wasn\u2019t left standing after the city was captured.\u201cYou can have it,\u201d she continues, \u201cand do what with it you will.\u201dThis is a fine exchange, she thinks. A good start. She'll happily indulge his grudge; it isn't any skin off her nose.

It\u2019s a reminder of Jun\u2019s staggering destructive potential, and why she is the choice for situations such as these.

Though she appreciates the thought in his attempt to negotiate, the only sort of respect he\u2019ll get is the sort of respect any sane individual gives to beasts physically stronger than themselves. The meeting has done little for Trogdor\u2019s standing with Isra, other than drawing attention to his ambitions. Naoki came to this meeting with a small personal grudge against the dragon, and she walks away with the knowledge that the dragon is in actually one step above the utterly simple-minded beast she thought him to be. And, she supposes, that much more dangerous. If Imperial Inquisitors weren't paying attention to his exploits, they certainly would be now.Lady Naoki says nothing further\u2014only smirks as Trogdor leaves.

If my intention is to befriend this creature to make it my mount, it wouldn\u2019t make sense to send soldiers to manhandle it.

So if you could, please, send a competent Marshal or two down to assist Ms. Saleia in the event that things don\u2019t go very well, and consult what repositories of knowledge you have access to, to see if anyone has ever seen something quite like this before and lived to write about it. And keep my carriage driver up to date on its movements, so we can find the thing. Thank you, Takhana.\u201dWith the last statement, Naoki manages to convey the telepathic equivalent of an appreciative smile.

The rhythmic clopping of the miniature horse drawing the carriage is joined both by the metallic friction noises of its wheels on the ground, and the first morning songs of the mockingbird, perched in some far-off tree. Stan, the carriage driver sits in his seat on the forefront of the carriage, swaying side to side with the natural contours of the road. Raising a hand to cover his mouth, he yawns. Why did this have to be so early? He adjusts the fit of his new uniform absently- a double breasted pea coat. The garment itself is a deep black, with columns of  shining silver buttons stretching down the front, almost like stars. The deep purple logo of The Midnight Sun is emblazoned on his right lapel, providing the moon for the night sky. But the thing is, the shoulders don\u2019t sit quite right. Stan\u2019s shoulders are rather narrow, and the shoulder pads are tending to slide off one side or the other- too large for him. He\u2019ll have to see about having it properly tailored when they got back.Within the body of the carriage, Jax- the similarly clad other half of the carriage team, pushes open the top hatch. Stepping up the ladder, he raises the upper half of his body through the opening, and uses a spyglass to gaze ahead at their destination. What an impressive building, he muses. He pans upwards to view the top of the structure through the limited field of view afforded by the skyglass, and notices the newly installed runic matrix sitting atop the structure. As a Midnight Sun Operative, he is privy to the quiet relationships between The Midnight Sun, The Black Tower, and The Red Sisterhood. He thinks back to the approximation of the device\u2019s power related to him during the early morning briefing, and shudders a bit at the sheer power of the thing. After taking a moment to train the spyglass around at the landscape as it rolls past, ensuring that they weren't being followed or observed, he ducks back down into the carriage, locking the hatch behind him and appreciating his choice of allegiance a bit more deeply than before.The carriage continues its journey across the plains up to the gatehouse of the main gate, rolling to a stop before the moat. Quiet codewords are exchanged between the gatehouse guard and Stan. The guard was expecting their approach, and after confirming the identity and status of the carriage, he sends word for the drawbridge to be lowered. With the metallic clanking of the great metal chains across the moat, it is done, the end of the drawbridge coming to rest neatly in its groove in the ground. With a nod and a salute, the gate guard indicates that the carriage is clear to proceed. With a returned salute and a whipping of the reigns, Stan and the great carriage continue across the drawbridge, the reinforced wooden planks creaking as the great steel carriage rolls across. However, the drawbridge holds, and as soon as the carriage is across, it draws back up with another great metallic racket of chains. The unnatural strength of the miniature pony continues to draw the carriage forward into The Black Tower compound towards the titular Tower. ", "1453785490000": "Madame Naoki leaps carefully from the door of the carriage, disregarding the ladder. The peplum of her jacket flutters a bit with the jump, but settles back into place quickly. Her outfit matches that of Stan and Jax, but is, obviously, a women's outfit, and has some additional accessories to indicate her station as the leader. A rich black military peplum jacket, with the same Midnight Sun logo emblazoned on the right lapel. A small handful of silver buttons hold the jacket shut over her purple turtleneck, and a pair of silver epaulets sit on the jacket\u2019s shoulders. Standing upright, she looks around. Hm. That would be The Black Tower. Seeing the monolithic structure towering up into the sky inspires a decidedly positive feeling in Naoki. A feeling of  \u201cLook at that. What a massive and powerful thing that I made.\u201d An inspiring feeling, a feeling of confidence, and satisfaction, seeing the extent of her influence given form, and knowing that the whole compound is at her command. Smoothing her peplum, she brings her gaze back downward. The early morning sun is just beginning to rise, illuminating the sky to the east with a warm orange glow that glints slightly off the polished metal armor of the carriage. ", "1453798534000": "\u201c... Well this is The Black Tower, Skarlet.\u201dNaoki waves her hand toward the tower, stretching up into the sky just behind them. \u201cSurely you\u2019ve seen it from Isra. Pretty distinctive building.  Like I mentioned on the ride over, Grandma runs the place. It\u2019s a proxy organization of ours dedicated to \u2018keeping the peace\u2019 or something specious like that. The point is that it\u2019s a legitimate front behind which we can have military forces and installations. It would be a bit strange if The Midnight Sun started installing barracks out back and mounted a massive runic weapon on the roof. I\u2019m here to run a sort of inspection, to make sure everything is running smoothly and to my liking. I allowed Grandma to do most of the setup work herself, and though I don\u2019t doubt her ability, there are probably some things that could be improved upon. There always are.\u201d", "1453800233000": "Naoki leans up against one of the carriage wheels and crosses her arms over her chest. She absently begins tracing the Midnight Sun logo on her jacket with her left index finger. \u201cOf course not, go ahead. You can share with me whatever you like, and it seems like we have some time to spend before someone comes out to meet us. What\u2019s on your mind?\u201d", "1453812222000": "\u201cUhm. Hmm.\u201d Madame Naoki puts a hand to her chin, and begins to think, turning to glance sidelong at Skarlet. There she is, bashfully looking at her feet, with her cute little parasol and red dress, as well as the worst possible problem. As the gears of her mind begin to spin, Naoki finds herself overcome with pity for Skarlet as she begins to think through the problem. To be so young, and to be saddled with such an insurmountable and terrible curse.She begins to empathize, thinking ahead, imagining a hypothetical future in which she is beset by the same curse. The world changing around her in fast-forward. Funerals. Funeral after funeral after funeral, caskets slamming shut on everyone she\u2019s ever known\u2026 Kate, Artemis\u2026 Wait. Artemis. Artemis has the same problem! Oh my god.A sharp intake of breath, Naoki bites her tongue as she turns the other way to look at Artemis. Or, more accurately, the back of Artemis\u2019 head, as she gazes upwards at the tower, likely using her sight to study the rune patterns present on the tower\u2019s surface. Has Artemis ever thought about this? \u2026 She probably has, but hasn\u2019t said anything. \u2026 Why? To spare her the guilt? \u2026No. No, that\u2019s not how Artemis thinks. Artemis hasn\u2019t said anything because she already has the solution. She has the solution a dozen times over, placed in strategic positions on her body. She has the solution in the sole of her shoe. She has the solution in a spring loaded deployment system in her sleeve, she has the solution in the small of her back, and hidden in her brassiere. Artemis is fully capable and willing to terminate the problem when it inevitably arises.Dammit, Skarlet. These are not the sorts of uplifting thoughts I\u2019d like to start my morning with.Naoki swallows, and removes small bit of debris from her eye, attempting to repress this sudden wave of emotion. She again finds herself thankful for the time she spent training to suppress her emotions. It would hardly do for her to start sobbing when asked for advice. With a few deep breaths and some mental calming techniques, the feeling is passed. Passed from the conscious, to that little place in the back of her mind where all of those repressed emotions sit bottled, to better allow her to act in the present, unhindered. Naoki briefly contemplates sharing Artemis\u2019 macabre solution with Skarlet, but decides against it. Skarlet is too young to be considering such things. She\u2019ll come to the same conclusion herself, eventually, Naoki thinks, in an uncharacteristically grim thought.Realizing how long she\u2019s spent in contemplation, Naoki takes another deep breath, nods, and begins.\u201c... Yeah. That\u2019s a problem that you\u2019ve got, isn\u2019t it. I\u2019ll try to offer what advice I can. Keep in mind that I don\u2019t have any personal experience in this sort of thing- only recently having gotten into a serious relationship myself,  and you might consider asking someone who shares your issue, of which I\u2019m sure there are many. \u2026 Though, I would caution you against taking relationship advice from Mr. Ulciscor. I have nothing against him, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s really the right person to ask about this sort of thing.\u201dNaoki turns to face Skarlet, and establishes eye contact as she begins to properly impart her advice.\u201cI apologize, but I\u2019m not going to sugarcoat this for you. It isn\u2019t my nature to make light of large problems. And yours is a very large problem, likely the most large and terrible problem anyone will ever consider or be faced with. Whatever course of action you decide to take, there won\u2019t be an end, and you\u2019ll likely be left highly dissatisfied with your immortality and the world as a whole. Let me say this just once before I begin, and know that I speak with the utmost sincerity when I do. I feel sorry for you. Though I feel bad to ruin your mood in this way, you will, over the course of your lifetime, likely be in for many times more sorrow, guilt, and negative feelings than I will ever experience. And in knowing this, I  genuinely pity you and your immortality, and wouldn\u2019t wish the same upon anyone else. I wish I could do more to help you, or provide a perfect solution, but I don\u2019t believe that one exists. So instead, let that be said, and let me try to give what suggestions and assistance I can.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t think that not loving someone is a realistic option. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s possible to completely close yourself off in that way that was recommended to you. Since you\u2019ve already dipped your feet in, and tasted what love is, you\u2019re not going to be able to stop. It\u2019s addictive in that way. You\u2019re going to get lonley eventually. Even if you can break up with Francesco now, you\u2019re going to wish that you hadn\u2019t. You\u2019re going to long for someone to hold you in the same way he has, to look into your eyes with that same passion. You\u2019re going to want someone to hug, someone to miss when they\u2019re not there, someone who will make you feel happy and safe, just by being present\u2026\u201d\u201cHehem.\u201d Naoki clears her throat, and reapplies a touch of professionalism to her tone. \u201cUnless that vampirism has been kind enough to change the very core of your being, your basic nature, first as a human, you\u2019re going to love again. Even if you can get over Francesco now, even if you can detach yourself and live alone for a while, it\u2019s going to come back. In a year, in ten years, in ten hundred years. Eventually, you\u2019re going to get lonely, and want someone. Love isn\u2019t something you can opt out of now that you\u2019re in.\u201d\u201cNo, you\u2019ve got to find a way around your issue. One option, though I\u2019m not sure if it would suit you, would be to live a sort of nomadic love life. Stick with Francesco for a while, a handful of years- ten or twenty or so, and then leave him. Remember him fondly, and find someone new and young to take his place. Continue the cycle indefinitely, and never stick around long enough to see the person age and die. If you decide to do it like that, you\u2019ll be spared some of the negative feelings of being present for their death. However, those feelings might set in later, worse, when you look back, a thousand years from now, and realize that Francesco is dead, and has been for hundreds of years. There will be someone new, yes, but in those in between periods, and when thinking about the past, it\u2019s going to be rough.\u201d\u201cAnother option might be to find or create someone with the same problem, and, in being two of a kind, make it not a problem for either of you. I\u2019m not particularly well versed in how exactly vampirism spreads, but in theory, you could just bite Francesco- or do whatever it is you do, and then he\u2019d be a vampire too, right? Or use some other method to make him immortal. In this magical world of today, I\u2019m sure there are plenty of ways you could go about it, and it wouldn\u2019t really matter which one, as long as he doesn\u2019t die. However you do it, problem solved, Francesco lives forever with you.\u201d\u201cOr at least, problem reduced.  You\u2019d still run into problems down the line when other people die. You can\u2019t really bite everyone that you care about, and maintain the same circle of friends forever. Because then they would all be faced with the same problem you\u2019re currently faced with, where all of the other people that aren\u2019t immortal die. Just as an example, through which I mean to imply nothing, me. I\u2019m going to die. This is a fact, and one that I\u2019m fine with. I wouldn\u2019t like to be immortal. Because if I were, them I\u2019d be faced with your same terrible problem, but with Kate, and essentially everyone else at The Sun; I care about a lot of people. What some might see as the greatest gift, I see as the greatest curse, immortality. I would hate you for it eternally.\u201dShe stops, aware of the words coming out of her mouth. She had far overstepped the realm of polite advice, had allowed her feelings to taint the discussion. \u201cBut my point is that it\u2019s hardly a realistic possibility, to make everyone you care about immortal. Attempting that would just breed a lot of negative emotions and resentment with a much larger group of people. No, if you\u2019re going to need to keep your list of people you care about as short as you can, to spare yourself as much heartache as possible.\u201d\u201cAnd to get around the rest of it, it would probably be best to find somewhere to live that\u2019s secluded, some place out in the country, where you don\u2019t have to watch townsfolk live and die, cities, nations, empires... civilizations rise and fall.\u201d\u201cThe largest issue with that would be that you would probably get very bored very quickly. But what\u2019s a little boredom, relative to the alternative? Not the worst problem to have, if you ask me. Find some books to read, dedicate yourself to the advancement of science, the production or art, or some other noble goal with which to occupy your time. Try to make the best of what you have.\u201dNaoki ends her speech there, on a positive note, but finds her professionalism cracking. She turns on her heel to face away from Skarlet,  and begins to take more deep breaths to maintain composure. ", "1453919695000": "Naoki turns and meets Skarlet\u2019s gaze. The calmness with which she accepts Naoki\u2019s advice is a bit off-putting, but not entirely unexpected. How strange it must be, to have woken up just over a year ago, and to be taking on these sorts of questions. Naoki wonders, is it just naivety? Does Skarlet fully understand the nature of her predicament, or the sorrow she\u2019ll feel? Heck, she\u2019s hardly dipped her feet into emotion. To say that her happiness now will surely be worth the sorrow later, is she only saying that because she knows no greater feeling than being with Francesco? What will happen, how will she change, when she experiences a more intense emotion? Does Skarlet even experience emotion in the same way that Naoki does? Does anyone even experience living in quite the same way as anyone else?In this moment, Naoki finds herself once again, pretty fed up with this whole 'emotions' thing. It sure would be excellent to have the ability to truly shut herself off from such things.\u201cWell you\u2019re a stronger lady than I am, Skarlet. The Midnight Sun will continue to provide you and any companions you might acquire with sustenance for as long as it persists; this I will ensure. If there\u2019s anything else that I can leverage my influence to do for you, you need only ask. And please don\u2019t hesitate to bring these sorts of topics up again- it\u2019s what I\u2019m here for.\u201dShe glances around, ears turning to attempt to discern the presence of any approaching figures. However, none make themselves obvious. Someone was supposed to come meet them. Naoki\u2019s brow furrows. It would seem like the local management would need some\u2026 modification. \u201cIn the meantime, though, where\u2019s that damn inspector? As excellent a discussion as this was, it\u2019s cold out here. I\u2019d much rather contemplate the complexities of life somewhere\u2026 warm.\u201dAs if to add emphasis, Naoki shivers a bit, the careful pleats of her peplum swaying a bit with the motion. ", "1453977350000": "Naoki waves her hand dismissively and scoffs at Zurt\u2019s statement about who would be \u2018allowed\u2019 to proceed. \u201cYou needn\u2019t make that precedent, Zurt. Skarlet is here with me, and has all of the necessary security paperwork. The purpose of my visit here is to showcase this facility to her. She won\u2019t cause any trouble on the tour, just get on with it.\u201dBehind them, Stan spurs the carriage into motion once more, making for one of the buildings in the compound, where they would expect to be met by some waiting members of The Red Sisterhood. ", "1454191032000": "Noaki nods, surveying the workshop with an appraising eye. She\u2019s made use of the workshop\u2019s production capabilities before, most of the building materials that went into the Chalet du Sommet were manufactured here. Apparently Zurt hasn\u2019t been kept quite in the loop about who exactly she is, and what role she plays in the larger group. And, she supposes, that\u2019s fine. He doesn\u2019t need to know to do his job, and it gives him the element of plausible deniability. She continues to nod appreciatively, gazing down at the great center of production. \u201cBrilliant. Things seem to be in order here. I have no questions.\u201d", "1454198001000": "Already having reviewed the construction plans in detail, Naoki isn\u2019t terribly surprised to see the massive storage areas. It\u2019s interesting to see the plans made reality, yes, and there is something impressive about the grand space, but it\u2019s not unexpected. Appreciative, but unsurprised.At Zurt\u2019s inquiry, Madame Naoki nods, and reaches into the pouch on her waist- from which she extracts a small, rolled up bit of parchment. Holding the tiny scroll dainty between two fingers, she proffers it to Zurt. \u201cMake sure to carefully follow the instructions about how the tunnels are to be connected.\u201d", "1454833889000": " Madame Naoki feigns surprise at Andraste\u2019s arrival, but maintains a neutral and polite smile. She nods, goal accomplished.\u201cIt is about time we took our leave anyway. Thank you for your time, Inspector Zurt. Minister Ruana, I hope to have the opportunity to make your acquaintance properly sometime soon. Perhaps when we both aren\u2019t so busy.\u201d Leading her party over to the door, she pushes it open, and provides some parting words, gaze fixed forward. \u201cUntil then; have a good day.\u201dWith that, she departs, accompanied by Artemis and Skarlet. They would accomplish a few other tasks at The Black Tower, but would depart within the hour, back to Isra in the now-complete carriage. ", "1460254206000": "Within the dark halls of The Black Tower, Madame Naoki walks her path with swift places, her boots tapping rhythmically on the stone floors. Soon enough, she reaches her destination: one of the teleportation arrival rooms. It is a cubic room, lit by small lanterns engraved with lighting glyphs. The walls of polished stone stretch upwards, engraved with advanced stabilization runes all the way to the top. The ceiling, floor, and room itself are otherwise featureless, and only a single narrow door sits centered on one of the walls. It is in this doorway that Naoki takes her position and stands expectantly. ", "1460256240000": "Madame Naoki extends a hand to clasp Jun\u2019s and makes eye contact. Her grip is firm, but not restrictive; warm but not uncomfortable.\u201cIndeed it is; I\u2019ve heard a lot about you. It\u2019s a pleasure to finally make your acquaintance, I hope it develops into something more. Take this.\u201dAfter the completion of the handshake and a teasing wink, Naoki reaches into one of the pockets of her uniform and pulls out a small, relatively unremarkable silver ring inlaid with a small amethyst. She offers it to Jun in the palm of her hand. \u201cThis ring serves the double purpose of serving as a telepathy enabler, similar to the one you used previously, and also confirming the wearer as a trusted individual who should not trigger security. I suggest you put it on, at least for the time being. Later, you might request an alternative way to wear it, or choose to return it. However, it is necessary to leave this room without getting vaporised. Let\u2019s walk and talk here for a moment on the way to meet Ms. Lum. \u201dAssuming that Jun takes the ring, Madame Naoki turns about and leads the way down one of the hallways, beckoning Jun to follow. As she walks, her tail sways side to side synchronously with her steps, ruffling her peplum with its movement. She glances over her shoulder, and poses her first question. \u201cSo, I\u2019ve heard a lot about you and your exploits from Ms. Lum and Maelik, but I\u2019m missing one part of your story. Though this may come off as rather forward of me, how did you get start your adventuring career?\u201d", "1460259623000": "At Jun\u2019s suggestion of rambling, Naoki waves a dismissive hand. \u201cI don\u2019t mind at all, don't worry about it. I find it immensely interesting to hear of the travels and exploits of others, and yours is a tale more interesting than most. I would love to sit you down and hear the entirety of your story from the source, perhaps record it in the form of a book, but for now, I\u2019ll have to make do with that tidbit. Thank you, that cleared up a lot.\u201dPresently, Naoki stops before a door. It is unmarked like all the rest, but Naoki confidently pushes it open, revealing a small meeting room. \u201cMs. Lum is still a ways away, let\u2019s wait in here. She\u2019ll be directed in when she arrives.\u201dLeading the way into the room, Naoki pulls out one of the chairs, and seats herself. She covers her mouth with one hand and yawns, still fighting off a bit of lingering drowsiness from her earlier nap. She blinks a few times before re-establishing eye contact with Jun. \u201cYou were a good sport about answering my question, so I feel it only fair to offer you the opportunity to ask some of your own. I imagine you probably have at least a few, at this point, and we have a few minutes to burn, here.\u201d", "1460265485000": "As Jun poses her question, one of Madame Naoki\u2019s eyebrows rises. She had be expecting a cutting, inquisitive question, yes, but not quite such a personal one. \u201cWhat do I want out of the world? \u2026 I\u2019ll give you credit, that\u2019s an excellent question. Perhaps not one I\u2019m able to answer fully, but I\u2019ll give it a shot.\u201dShe takes a moment to collect her thoughts, and selects a marble from her pouch to fool with as she begins to speak.\u00a0\u201cIn one hundred years, I will be gone. Dead, of natural causes or perhaps by something more malicious. My body, likely entombed beneath the ground in a fancy box. And the world as a whole, it will ultimately\u00a0be\u00a0rather unaffected by my passing. Even though some may remember me, and my actions may leave a less temporary impact on the world than myself, I am but a tiny mote on the face of this world, if perhaps a marginally more impactful mote than some others. I don\u2019t believe there to be any great overarching purpose or meaning to my life, or to lives in general. My existence was brought about by circumstance, though I know not the exact details. What I perceive to be consciousness, in all likelihood, won\u2019t last for very long at all, relative to the grand concepts of the universe or civilization. I don\u2019t believe that I was placed here by any omnipotent power, with any directive or instructions.  There isn\u2019t any objective meaning to my life; I simply am.\u201d\u201cHowever, I am. Here, I am; living, operating, and acting in this world I share with you. It is in this fact, that there is no inherent meaning to the life I live, that I find freedom. I am totally free to exert my will on the world I live in, however I see fit.. I am free in every sense of the word, to do as I wish. I may choose how to live my life, what actions to take to accomplish any goal I might designate for myself. And in this radical freedom, I am free to decide what I want, what meaning I would like my brief stay on this earth to have. I am free to choose what I believe to be right and wrong, I am free to choose my companions, how I treat them, and in what ways I will alter this world. I am free to choose what I give subjective value to, free to choose who I love, and what I do with my life.\u201d\u201cAnd I remember, that I will not be free forever. Eventually, as all do, I will die. And that\u2019s fine. I think that living for too long would get boring anyway. It would almost devalue each moment, as one of a limited number of moments in which I am totally free. And if I were to live forever, what point would there be in living, after all those who I have cared about have died? I have chosen to place a great deal of subjective value into my relationships with others. I have- perhaps through my formative years, or perhaps due to my natural disposition, adopted the habit of enjoying interacting with others, especially those individuals I hold in high regard. I find it endlessly engaging to interact with other beings as nuanced and complex as myself. I cannot hope to truly understand another individual, for I do not even fully understand even myself, but yet, I can try. I think that I have what amounts to a relatively deep, yet not complete understanding of a few. I have a fairly substantial number of close relationships, with my adopted family, co-workers, and associates. I will always find it enjoyable to meet new individuals, and learn about them, their experiences, and how they perceive the world. But I digress- without those individuals I have chosen to invest myself in, the meaning I have given my life would no longer exist. Thus, I would never take the option of immortality, if it was presented to me. No, I prefer life as it is; brief, finite, and without any objective value to it.\u201d\u201cAnd though I hate to use the word, as it sort of disparages all of the work I have put into shaping my life into the rather pleasant state it is, I consider myself fortunate. Fortunate to have happened across so many excellent individuals, fortunate for having been able to befriend them, and share in what we consider \u2018life\u2019 with them. Fortunate for finding such an excellent companion in Artemis, fortunate for happening across an individual- almost entirely by chance whom I am able to love with every ounce of my being. Fortunate to simply exist, and live on this world, at this time.\u201d\u201cSo, I suppose\u2026 to answer your question, there is nothing more enjoyable or more painful that you or I will experience than life itself. All of our experiences, pleasant and otherwise, happen in this narrow little window we call our lives. All I\u2019d like to do is enjoy mine.\u201d\u201cBut, to be more specific, that means, in my case, at this present chapter of my life, essentially improving the state of the lives of others, especially those I care about.\u201d\u201cI have, in my own quest to live comfortably, acquired the means to do essentially whatever I please. I don\u2019t mean for this to come off as bragging, but I am unfathomably rich and influential. I have built up an enormous capability to enact whatever changes I see fit on the lives of those I see fit. Look at this tower, for a moment. You\u2019re a powerful mage, you can surely sense the immense power sitting dormant here. At a single command from my mouth, this facility could reduce the city of Isra to dust, or instantly end the life of any foolish enough to attack it, to speak nothing of the combatants housed within. I have an immense network of powerful and influential individuals who are loyal to me, though coin or trust. They are armies to march on my enemies, or allies to work cooperatively by my guidance. I could, in a single gesture, end your life, or bestow upon you weapons with which you could use to conquer nations. If I was able to liquidate all of my accumulated wealth at market value, (assuming that such a massive amount of gold exists, and the economy doesn\u2019t change at all,) and divide it evenly across Isra, each inhabitant could afford to have their very own castle built.\u201d\u201cI think\u2026 what I truly enjoy is having and using that capability. There is nothing that pleases me more than to see a friend prosper and attain happiness by my hand, or to remove a problem that plagues those I care about. This is why I continue to expand my networks and my influence, it is to expand that capability to do those things. I hope to be remembered by many as the best thing that ever happened to them. To be remembered by at least a few as the being who changed their lives for the better, and allowed them to live at least a portion of their life in happiness.\u201d\u201cI realize that sometimes this means killing. I realize that I have, directly and indirectly, brought death and despair to an awful lot, and that if I continue to operate as I have, this will continue. I cannot begin to grasp at this ever-growing number, and I do feel sorrow for doing so, but not remorse. I have made it this far in life without any major regrets, and will never regret choosing the good that is greater to me. This is because death, despair and all things unpleasant will still continue to exist, and I am powerless to stop them. I can do my best to mitigate them, sure, but as long as there are two humans alive on this world, someone is going to want someone else dead.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve come to learn, that\u2019s a simple fact of human nature, and an awful lot of other species\u2019 nature, too. As so long as human nature remains as it is, humans will want to kill other humans. Even I am not above this flaw. If you were to suddenly interrupt me, and spew hurtful words, insult this very core of my being that I am in the process of disclosing, I would probably want you dead. I can\u2019t help it, and neither can you. If I committed some crime against you or those who you care about, you would probably want me dead, too. All we can do is have restraint. I wouldn\u2019t kill you, no matter what you might have to say, because as a powerful and living mage, you have plenty of applications, willing or not. Likewise, assuming that you\u2019re even mildly sane, you won\u2019t make an attempt on my life because a successful one would mean angering so many of my allies, and would undoubtedly end in a very painful death for you and all you care about.\u201d\u201cAll humans have this flaw, this capacity for malice. This is how I know that there is no omnipotent god worth worshipping. If there is, they created this flaw, or have the capability to change it. But they do not. If all of creation was designed by a god, or a series of gods, or however you might like to consider it, that means that they have devised every unhappiness and terror there is. Every pang of sorrow, every ounce of guilt. They have designed disease, monsters, dragons individuals who would see the world consumed by flames, and worst of all, humans themselves. If we were designed, this fatal flaw, this capacity for malice was designed to exist. If that is the case, I will worship no such god who did such a thing. If it is not, then there are no omnipotent gods to worship.\u201d\u201cAnyway. I digress. With that said, in an attempt to answer your question, \u2018What do I want out of this world?\u2019 as concisely as I can, I will say this. I have chosen to place value on interacting with and understanding other beings, and seem to enjoy doing what I can to enable those I care about to be happy, and expanding my capability to do so. My all of my most basic motivations are built upon this underlying reason I have given to my life, and it is by extension of this philosophy I have done all that I have so far, and I will continue to act in this manner until the hypothetical future when my philosophy changes.\u201dWith all of that said, Naoki takes a moment to clear her throat and consider if anything else needs to be said, but it does not. She continues to watch Jun for her reaction.", "1460272207000": "Jun\u2019s laughter is infectious, and Naoki can\u2019t help but chuckle, though she remains seated. \u201cThat\u2019s just it isn\u2019t it? That\u2019s the joke. All of our lives are absurd. You and I, and everyone else, all of our lives, all of the world, all of creation, it\u2019s all so massively absurd. Eventually, all we know, all we live and love and learn, all of the wonderful stories and the excellent people and everything, it will all be gone. More 'gone' than we can really understand. That fact, simply as it is, makes all of creation absurd. There is no true, objective meaning to anything at all. All any of us have, or ever will have, are whatever goals we choose for ourselves, whatever small solace we choose to take in interacting with others and doing what we enjoy.\u201d\u201cBut that\u2019s all we can do! The best thing that anyone can ever do is accept the absurdity of life, and roll with it! Accept it, but don\u2019t despair in it! Accept it, but be defiant! Don\u2019t let it dominate your life, live in spite of it, live how you want to live!\u201dRealizing that she has joined Jun in standing, and has been speaking with a great deal of volume and enthusiasm, Naoki stops, and considers reseating herself, but decides not to. Still standing, she moves around to lean on the end of the table, a position from which she can see Jun on the floor, and continues in a more sedate tone.\u201cAnyway,\u00a0I think you and I will get along just fine, Jun. It\u2019s been more of a pleasure to get to know you than I anticipated it being. Hopefully, this meeting marks the start of what will develop into a lasting and productive relationship for us both.\u201d", "1460327401000": "Without anything much better to do, Naoki stands and is hugged. She allows Lum to choose how long it lasts, and claps Lum once on the shoulder after they part, before reseating herself and nodding back to Jun. In response to Jun\u2019s query, Naoki addresses Lum, \u201cWould you explain, or should I?\u201d", "1460501832000": "Madame Naoki raises a hand and nods in greeting to Arya as she enters the room. She then places a hand on the file, indicating it and making eye contact with Jun.\u201cJun, this is a compilation of all of the information I have on Goraia and the circumstances surrounding its birth. It contains quotes from refugees, scrying data collected from my associates, and the observations of my scouts. Unfortunately, it\u2019s not a complete set of data; I have no one on the inside, and their wards are very good. However, I offer what information I do have for your perusal, on one condition.\u201dNaoki holds up a single finger to indicate exactly how many conditions she has. With her other hand, she reaches into the pocket of her jacket, and pulls out a small card of parchment, which she places atop the file, and then slides the conglomerate across the table to Jun. \u201cTuesday night, at sunset. You and I have many things to discuss, but they can wait until then. I won't keep you from assisting Ms. Lum any longer.\u201d  ", "1461470023000": "From one of the side doors leading into the tower, some nondescript attendant notices, and gesticulates to Tristian, waving him over. Assuming that Tristian makes his way within earshot, the door opens by sliding to one side, and attendant proceeds to direct Tristian inwards with a polite wave of his hand. The hallway beyond the door is decidedly featureless, simply smooth, gray stone. There are no doors, visible lights, or interruptions of any sort. How the hall is lit is anyone\u2019s guess, but a good guess might be \u2018magic\u2019. After perhaps forty paces worth of straight hallway, there stands a door. As with just about everything up until this point, it\u2019s really nothing particularly interesting. Like its predecessor, it opens by sliding to one side, revealing the room beyond. It seems to be something of a ready-room. The walls are adorned with all manner of armor and weaponry, all forged of the same dark steel. Short benches and freestanding racks of equipment fill out the floorspace comfortably. However, one of the racks provides purchase for something a good bit more interesting than any boring broadsword- though she is rather well-endowed. Madame Naoki sits atop the weapon rack, feet dangling, a small tome in one hand. As with the last occasion on which she visited The Black Tower, she wears her deep black, , silver buttoned, double breasted military uniform- though today it is without an insignia. As she notices Tristian enter, the book is clamped shut, and with a small hopping motion, she stands upright on the floor, and moves over to greet him, offering her right hand to shake. \u201cAha. Lord Seryl. It\u2019s good to meet you in person.\u201d", "1461476519000": "\u201cAh, likewise. You\u2019re taller than you seemed. Here.\u201dAfter completing the handshake, Madame Naoki reaches into her coat. After a bit of fumbling, she extracts a peculiar sort of ring, which she offers to Tristian. After waiting a moment for him to take it, and another to get another look at him, Naoki abruptly spins about, \u2018accidentally\u2019 brushing the tip of her tail across his chest. \u201cThis way.\u201dWith that, and with Artemis   in tow, Madame Naoki proceeds out the door on the opposite side of the room, into the hallway beyond, to their first destination. As she walks, she speaks again.\u00a0\"The ring is both a signet ring, signifying your leadership of The Black Tower, as well as the housing for one of the telepathy-enabling gemstones I mentioned earlier. With it, you should be able to- with a bit of practice, reach out and speak to any individual who wears a similar gem. I perform almost all of my long distance communication and coordination in this way, so I suggest that you attempt to learn it well, quickly.\"", "1461589143000": "\u201cIt\u2019s really more of a mental thing, than a magical thing, in my opinion. I cannot perform traditional sorcery enough to light a cigar, but my communicative skills with the gems here, are- to the best of my knowledge, unmatched. I am able to carry on multiple mental conversations simultaneously, and share images and concepts through the telepathy that is now available to you. As I\u2019ve seen, it will take some time to become truly proficient, but as I mentioned, the utility is without peer.\u201dShe continues to lead Tristian and Artemis down the hall, waving at one of the barracks doors they pass by. \u201cI\u2019m sure you\u2019re literate, but these are the barracks. Some of them, at least. There are many instances of housing throughout the tower, but these ones here are simply for your standard sorts of human soldiers.There\u2019s nothing\u2026 particularly special about any of them, beyond some of the accommodations that need to be made for some sorts, but all told\u2026 I believe that The Tower here can support\u2026 perhaps\u2026 twelve thousand individuals? Something around that many, I\u2019m not quite sure. Depends somewhat on how you classify an 'individual'.\u201dMadame Naoki waves dismissively at her own lack of definitive knowledge on the subject, and continues to gesticulate as she speaks and walks. \u201cWell. I say \u2018support\u2019, but a more accurate word would be \u2018house\u2019. Though there are wells on-site, there isn\u2019t nearly enough renewable food production within The Tower to support that many men indefinitely. There are fairly sizeable larders, yes, and ways to get food into the complex beyond walking it through the gate- tunnels and teleportation and the such, but in the event of a prolonged siege, that would be a concern.\u201dShe pauses in both speech and pace for a moment, realizing where her words have led. After taking a moment to compose herself, she continues, slower both in gait and cadence. \u201cThat was a bit of a tangent, I apologize. A prolonged siege is among the least likely scenarios that The Black Tower may face, and it\u2019s hardly a good place to start briefing you- I haven\u2019t even properly introduced myself. Though. I suppose our conversation last week sort of precluded that- you knew who I was when you walked in, but\u2026\u201dAgain, she stops in her stride, and turns to face Tristian, speaking emphatically with her hands in a more purposeful tone.\u00a0\u201cRegardless! Tristian! I\u2019m going to call you Tristian, if that\u2019s quite alright with you. Refer to me however you see fit. Like we discussed, you\u2019re going to take charge of the entire Black Tower organization, and run it in my stead. My involvement here is strictly confidential, and if anyone ever asks, you know me only as a positive acquaintance on strictly official terms. There are a number of higher ranking individuals within my organizations who are aware of the reality of things, but never assume, and never state publicly. Here, and in other private areas, we may do and say exactly whatever we please, but in official and public situations, keep your camaraderie to reasonable levels.\u201d\u201cWith that said, the purpose of our meeting today has a few purposes. First and foremost, it was my intention to meet you personally. And in that regard, I am satisfied so far, and hope to continue to become acquainted with you over the course of the day. The second goal is to give you the silver-coin-tour of the place, and offer some editorial comments on some particular features. It\u2019ll be on you to spend the time to learn The Tower\u2019s intricacies well enough to take full advantage of them, but you can do that in the fullness of your own time; I\u2019ve got other things to attend to, and don\u2019t even know this place particularly well myself. Beyond that, there are some procedural and mechanical directives and guidelines I intend to inform you of, so you might better do your job.\u201d\u201cRight. There we go. That was a proper opening, excellent. Third time's the charm, I suppose. Anyway, like I said, the barracks. Let\u2019s proceed.\u201d Seemingly satisfied with those words, she nods with an air of finality, and turns back to the hallway ahead, continuing to wave her hands about, but now with a slightly more casual and warm tone to the wavings and the accompanying speech. \u201cTo be completely honest for just a moment, I have absolutely no idea where this hallway leads. I suppose that I could check, but that would ruin some small portion of the surprise. It probably leads to some closet, or a lift or something equally dull. As we tread ever closer to that impending disappointment, do you have any questions about what I\u2019ve told you so far, or anything else, for that matter? I would much rather attempt to field your largest inquiries to the best of my ability than to attempt to guess what information you might find relevant.\u201d ", "1461618753000": "Before beginning her response to Trisitian\u2019s series of inquiries, Madame Naoki makes her way over to the lift\u2019s rune panel, and bends at the waist to examine it. Thinking back to the last time she had used one of these lifts, the attendant had pressed on that inscription- the box-looking one in the top left. Cautiously, she applies the pressure of two fingers to the runic symbol.Immediately, the lift begins to move, creeping its way upward slowly. This development elicits a small grumble of frustration from Naoki, and she removes her hand. Of course it would move up; that\u2019s the direction the attendant had meant to move the lift last time. Further thinking about it, Naoki realizes that she\u2019s never taken one of these lifts down, always having teleported out from the top or teleported in from the bottom. Do the lifts even go down? They must, surely. Otherwise all of the lifts would eventually get stuck at the top. However\u2026 considering the intricacies of the panel of runes before her, Naoki realizes that she has absolutely no idea how to make the lift do that. There must be at least twenty sigils on here- what do they even all do? It\u2019s a lift. It goes up, and it goes down. Why must it be so complex? Surely, a lever would do just as well, or simply just two inscriptions! With a short huff, she turns her back on the panel, and motions to Artemis. \u201cCould you\u2026?\u201d Artemis is generally knowledgeable about these sorts of things, and even if she doesn\u2019t know this particular panel, she is better equipped to figure it out, and should at least be able to make the lift proceed upward with a bit more expediency. \u201cGoodness, no. Supporting twelve thousand men within the tower here would be enormously expensive. In times of relative peace, there\u2019s no need to maintain quite so many as all that. Well. That, and it would be difficult to justify that many if anyone from Isra started asking questions. It might seem somewhat suspicious for us to maintain a garrison essentially as large as Isra\u2019s own. Right now, I believe there are somewhere in the ballpark of one thousand, five hundred humanoids in residence here, in addition to some number of beasts, golems and the like.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t worry quite so much about my schedule; I\u2019ve cleared it for today. There are other things, yes, but as far as my business goes, making sure you, of all people, know what you ought to be doing is rather high on my list, and I can justify spending the day on it. It\u2019s very important that you be able to function essentially autonomously, and effectively command these resources I\u2019ve allocated to you. At some point along our tour, we should probably touch base with Raik\u014d . She\u2019s a member of the Red Sisterhood, and the High Priestess of their Cult of Storms. She is primarily responsible for many of the runic devices you see around, and is directly responsible for the device on the top of the tower. I think I\u2019ll let her detail that to you, I wouldn\u2019t do it proper justice.\u201d", "1461679997000": "\u201cWell, it\u2019s basically a big sort of\u2026 I think they may have used the term \u2018runic matrix\u2019. It\u2019s a powerful sort of magic casting tool... structure- to the best of my knowledge, the largest and most powerful in its class. It was enormously expensive- they billed me a ludicrous sum, but they tell me that it could- with some preparation and the right magitechs operating it- reduce Isra to ash, among other things.\u201dShe pauses for a moment, in reflection of that somewhat unsettling thought, before continuing with a bit of dry humor. \u201cI would ask that you check with me before doing anything quite like that, though. I\u2019m rather fond of the place, personally.\u201dThe remainder of the ride down to the forge is relatively uneventful. Madame Naoki notices Tristian\u2019s apparent interest in the intricacies of the uniform lift shaft, and suppressed a satisfied smirk. This is precisely the sort of  man she was looking for to fill this position, and this seems to be exactly the sort of dynamic she prefers to have. Shortly enough, the lift reaches their destination, and Madame Naoki leads the way off the lift, over to the forge. Rather than proceeding all the way down to the work floor, she opts to tour Tristian across the same catwalk Zurt had taken her across before. The forge itself is a massive room, likely one of the largest artificial subterranean rooms within the Tower complex. Roughly cubical, perhaps five stories to a side, their catwalk cuts directly across the center. Below, all manner of metalworking apparatus, smelteries, anvils, and anvil accessories surround a large, circular forge in the center of the room, the smokestack for which extends upward into the ceiling, causing their catwalk to curve in either direction around it. Workers putter about below, going about their business, moving to and fro, carrying their projects around. Naoki steps confidently forward across the slim bridge,  knowing Artemis to be only a step behind. She gestures around and downward, and speaks up slightly to be heard over the hammering and crackle of flames. \u201cThis is the forge! It\u2019s one of the largest of its type, and the workers down there, the dwarves, they\u2019re very skilled at their job. If you need something made, odds are that it can be made here. It\u2019s not always as busy as all this, but right now they\u2019re working on a project of mine. \u201dThe activity below seems somewhat chaotic, but an analytical look at the patterns of movement might suggest that the smiths are moving in a massively complicated, yet highly efficient sort of dance. Their activities seem to center around a series of structures in the far corner of the room, where one may be able to recognize a series of blast furnaces being fed by bellows being pumped by some manner of mechanical contrivance, crucibles filled with molten metal, and other bits and bobs related to the production of large metal plates and beams.Leaning to look down over the railing, Madame Naoki spends a few moments silently observing the proceedings. Turning her head slightly to speak to Tristian, she keeps her gaze trained downward. \u201cI\u2019ve always found it interesting to watch large, coordinated groups do things. Though I understand each of the individual processes they\u2019re accomplishing, I\u2019m not sure how they do it all so quickly and fluidly, in such a large group. How do they know where to move next? How do they time it so none of them are waiting, bumping into each other, or anything like that? I would assume that practice plays a large role, but it\u2019s still fascinating to watch.\u201d", "1461723503000": "Naoki doesn\u2019t even bother trying to get a word in edgewise as Raiko approaches and continues past. She knows the woman means no intentional disrespect, and no geniuses are without their eccentricities. Letting Raiko speak her piece is but a small price to pay for the extent of her skills. Well. That\u2019s not to say she\u2019s not being paid well, but Naoki figures it best not to make a fuss. \u201cRight. Well, it seems like our next stop is the top. Let\u2019s go have a look at the device.\u201dGesturing for Trisitan to follow, she starts after Raiko, proceeding at her own- considerably more reasonable pace. ", "1461806782000": "Madame Naoki gives Tristian a curious look as he makes his first attempt at telepathy. She raises a salacious eyebrow, and responds mentally with a high degree of clarity, even managing to infuse the thoughts with an inflection of affected embarrassment. \u201cNot in the lift, Tristan. Goodness. Have you no shame?\u201dWith that said, the lift comes to a halt, and Naoki wastes no time in following Raiko out, punctuating her statement with a chastising tail poke. Artemis follows close behind her, leaving Tristian alone to reflect on his forwardness and follow at his own leisure. As Raiko leads the way out through the entrenchments, Naoki casts curious and calculating glances all around. Though she had reviewed the plans for this uppermost section of The Tower, she hasn\u2019t returned since the installation of the device. To see all of the heavy equipment and advanced artificery\u2026 It\u2019s impressive, to say the very least. However, Naoki has no comment to offer, simply shaking her head in response to Raiko\u2019s inquiry and continuing to examine the equipment all around. ", "1461842478000": "A slight smirk worms its way across Madame Naoki\u2019s face as Tristian jumps. On the list of her favorite pastimes, \u2018teasing\u2019 is very near the top. Naoki continues to follow Raiko as she leads the way toward the ladder. \u201cYou go ahead, if you would prefer to. She\u2019ll probably continue to refer to you as \u2018new boss man\u2019, though.\u201dFor Tristian\u2019s benefit, she follows directly behind Raiko up the ladder, and up onto the roof. After taking a moment to move aside from the hatch, she begins to take in the sights. First and foremost, the aforementioned Kami. Though Naoki possesses no form of magesight or magical sensitivity, the power is quite palpable. And this is its dormant state, even. It would probably be highly dangerous to stand where they\u2019re standing when the device is firing, she figures.Looking on the thing inspires a strange mix of emotions for Naoki. For one thing, it\u2019s incredibly dangerous. Even though she knows that it doesn\u2019t pose any threat to her, it could. Mistakes have been made before, and to stand so close to it\u2026 a somewhat frightening experience. Secondly, the power. The Kami positively radiates power, and it is hers to command. To think... She could, at any moment, point to something- anything, issue an order, and have whatever the object in question is utterly obliterated in a matter of seconds by this terrifying weapon\u2026 Such power, literally at her fingertips, equal parts satisfying and terrifying to contemplate.Lastly, the fullness of the situation strikes her. Here she is, standing atop this Black Tower. Easily one of the most powerful military installations in the world. To one side, one of the foremost geniuses in the fields runic magic and artifice- responsible for the terrifying weapon before them. To her other side, an (admittedly deposed) Medanese nobleman. Both of them, her contractually bound employees. To consider the fullness of this situation, in the context that only a few year prior, Naoki had been scrubbing the floors of a crummy bar to earn food for the day\u2026 It\u2019s almost humorous, in a somewhat frightening sort of way. That blend of emotions aside, the Kami is undeniably an impressive feat of engineering. Even though she cannot begin to grasp at the principles behind it, the stated capabilities alone are worthy of admiration. However, while they\u2019re up here, Naoki decides to turn her back on the Kami to admire the view from atop the tower. In a manner quite reminiscent of that view from the mountainside, the landscape of the Free Plans stretches before her in all directions. Travelers on the roads are as ants, and far to the west\u2026 the ocean is almost visible. However, before Naoki can spend too much time admiring the view, a particularly stiff gust of wind strikes her from behind, ruffling her peplum in ways it was never meant to be ruffled, nearly causing her to lose balance. She regains her footing easily, but that\u2019s quite enough of that, thank you very much. She wastes no time in following Raiko right back down the ladder, and into the relative safety of the indoors. Again, she has no questions, and after straightening her attire, looks to Tristian, figuring he must at least have some manner of inquiry.", "1461897063000": "In response to Raiko\u2019s status update, Madame Naoki nods. They certainly do work quickly. Afterwards, she addresses Tristian\u2019s inquiry about the tour. \u201cAh, I don\u2019t think the tour is over just quite yet.\u201dWith a wave of her hand and a slight smirk, Naoki gestures toward another lift, and leads the way into it. Once aboard, she takes a posistion leaning on one of the rails toward the rear, and gestures to the panel. \u201cWe still haven\u2019t visited your quarters, after all. One of you- take us down a few floors.\u201d", "1462131015000": "A short exhalation follows Tristian\u2019s comment about embarrassment. Though she had never had the opportunity to observe the noble families of old Medan, they must be the very proper sheltered sort, she presumes. It\u2019s endearing, how Tristian becomes embarrassed at the mere presence of women in his bedchambers, even as fully clothed as they are. As he makes his suggestion, her smirk curves wider. Does he know what a sauna is? Seems strange of him to propose such a thing, but it works well enough for her. \u201cYes, let\u2019s.\u201dAllowing Tristian to usher them from the room, Naoki takes the lead as they re-enter the hallway, pushing open the door to the sauna, and preceding her companions into the room beyond.A wall divider shields the interior of the room from the hallway beyond, but once around it, rather than leading directly into the sauna itself, the room seems to be something of a preparatory room. A thin curtain separates the left side of the room from the right, though it doesn\u2019t quite stretch from wall to wall, and stops shortly before the single stone door, presumably leading inward to the sauna itself. The far left and right walls are dominated by large shelving units, filled partially with towels. A smattering of benches serve to fill the floorspace in the center of the room. It is upon one of these benches, on the right side of the curtain, that Naoki seats herself, and directs her attention downward to the double columns of buttons holding her jacket shut. One by one, they come undone, and the garment slides from her shoulders. The rest of the uniform soon follows, the shadow cast on the screen providing tantalising impressions of her figure. ", "1462163714000": "\u201cA better question may be, \u2018Why are you not?\u2019 Are you waiting for a written invitation?\u201dThere is the brief pause as some cloth-like friction noises from beyond the curtain implies the removal of another article of clothing.\u201cIt\u2019s a sauna, Tristian. The idea is that one goes in, has a seat, and enjoys a short while in the steamy room. Between the steam and one\u2019s perspiration, things tend to get rather wet. I wouldn\u2019t much care to wear around a damp uniform for the rest of the day, and I\u2019m willing to bet that the sauna would absolutely ruin that nice coat of yours. As such, the concept is such that one leaves their clothing here, and proceeds into the sauna without it.\u201dWith that said, Naoki evidently finishes changing, as she appears around the edge of the divider, a towel wrapped about her torso, and another smaller towel held in her left hand. She pauses for a moment to exhale sharply at the sight of Tristian, sitting there, staring directly ahead, before pushing on the the door with her right hand. The door is evidently somewhat more difficult to open than she anticipated, not budging with her casual application of pressure. In response, she leans into the motion, bare feet struggling to gain traction on the smooth floor, and the towel nearly becoming dislodged as a result. However, she manages it, and the door slowly opens on creaking hinges. The room beyond- the sauna itself, is somewhat larger than the preparation room. A square room, perhaps five meters to a side, with two concentric levels of polished wooden benches ringing the three walls not holding the door. The walls themselves are made of well fit stone bricks, a design decision that helps to allow the room retain heat. In the center of the otherwise empty floor space, a small pile of somewhat greenish rocks sit in a circular depression, covered by a metal grate at floor level. A small grayish square shape sits on the floor directly before the grating, with a few runic symbols inlaid upon it. It is before this box that Naoki crouches, reaching down with one hand to touch, while the other hand holds the towel steady. After a moment of this fiddling, a chute in the ceiling directly above the grate begins to discharge water at an alarming rate, which crashes down through the grate onto the stones below. Evidently, the stones are quite hot, and cause the water to evaporate essentially instantaneously. Not only is Naoki blasted by the sudden burst of steam, and not only is the sauna room filled with steam, but it also manages to roll across the floor and out the door into the preparation room. A short yelp of surprise also makes its way back out into the preparation room. Again, Naoki\u2019s lack of expertise when it comes to operating rune panels comes to bite her, in a more surprising and decidedly more disrobing manner than previously. She had raised her hand to shield her face, and the towel had indeed been dropped. However, after a few moments of irritated grumbling and incessant fumbling through closed eyes, she manages to get the flow of water under control, down to a moderate, yet steady stream. Clouds of steam still billow up to fill the room, and still may be described as excessive, but at the very least, they\u2019re not quite so explosive as previously. This seems to be enough to satisfy Naoki for the time being, as she picks her towel up from the floor, makes her way over to the right side of the room, spreads the towel out on the upper bench, and proceeds to lie down upon it. The smaller cloth is placed across her face, obscuring her vision even more so than the thick clouds of steam, and having the effect of shielding one\u2019s face from the steam, consequently leading to a more preferable distribution of heat over the body. ", "1462244397000": "Though her expression is hidden under the cloth covering her face, Madame Naoki\u2019s tail twitches slightly at Tristian\u2019s comment. Whether it is a twitch of amusement, irritation, or some other emotion altogether is up for debate, but the intonation of the words that follow is decidedly unfazed. \u201cNot only presumptuous, but also preemptive. I\u2019ve only just sat down. Have some patience, why don\u2019t you. \u201dNaoki wiggles slightly to fit her tail more comfortably into the groove between the two planks that compose the bench, the motion displaying her curves enticingly. Whether this is intentional or not is entirely unclear. \u201cI invite you to have a seat. If you\u2019ve not experienced a sauna yet, you really should. Goodness knows you have a lot on your mind, and a sauna is an excellent remedy for a great variety of stresses. I probably owe my continued relative degree of sanity to regular sauna sessions. Don\u2019t sit directly on the bench, though, get a towel. I usually find lying down preferable, but you may find that\u2026 difficult at the moment. Put a cloth over your face as I have if you find your face too hot.\u201d", "1462420331000": "Still lying just as she was on the bench opposite Tristan, an audible chuckle escapes from beneath the cloth covering Madame Naoki\u2019s face. Her chest heaves with the motion, and she again shifts about on the bench. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be able to relax with those strained groans. I think that\u2019s quite enough, Artemis; his self control seems fine to me.\u201dThis statement is followed by a small hand movement in their direction; a sort of flicking motion wherein some of her fingers are extended, but not others. After completing the motion, Naoki folds her hands across her stomach, and trains her ears toward the opposite side of the room.", "1462505361000": "A few minutes later, Madame Naoki rises from her position on the bench. This sauna session wasn\u2019t quite the tranquil time for introspection reflection and relaxation that they usually were, but it was enjoyable in its own unique, mildly voyeuristic way. Not only that, but it wasn\u2019t a scheduled one, either; there will be another more standard session in only a few days. As she stretches, the corners of her lips curve upward slightly, a subtle signal of satisfaction. Not only enjoyable, the past hour had been quite enlightening. Tristian seems to be just the sort of man for this job - a perfect fit. The purposes of the meeting complete, she moves around the grating in the center of the room to stand over Tristian and give her parting remarks. \u201cIt was a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Trisitan. I\u2019m satisfied with your performance so far, and suspect that you will do well in this position. Keep up the good work, and perhaps we\u2019ll have your next performance review in here, instead of one of those boring meeting rooms.\u201d", "1465785628000": "The voice of Madame Naoki sounds telepathically and simultaneously in the minds of both Tristian and Xel\u2019rath. \u201cI don\u2019t believe so. This information matches what I am being told by Isra\u2019s men and women on the scene. I\u2019ll issue instructions to see to it that Miss Nyx is escorted to Isra safely, and begin preparations on my end for an international summit. I have no further orders to issue here.\u201d", "1472474203000": "With a CRACK, Madame Naoki appears without preamble in one of The Black Tower\u2019s arrival rooms, just having teleported from The Sun Marshal Headquarters. Taking no moments to compose herself or otherwise flaff about, she storm directly out of the room into the hallway, and through the hallways and up the lifts all the way to the door of Tristian\u2019s office. With a glare in her eyes that could pierce steel, she very delicately raises one hand to the door and knocks three times, very deliberately, with the back of her knuckles. Standing there, waiting for him to open the door, Naoki bides her time quietly, teeth clenched, ears flattened against the top of her head, tail swishing back and forth with unusual quickness.", "1472529380000": "Storming past Tristian into the office, Naoki waves her arms about in wild gesticulation as she responds, \u201cLots of things, Tristian, all sorts of things! But notably, those Gorain bastards.\u201dShe fixes him with a very intense sort of look, intending to show that she is now- as of only a few minutes ago, of like mind regarding their rude neighbors to the south. Plopping down unceremoniously onto one of his sofas, she continues, voice positively dripping with malice, \u201cGet a pen; we\u2019re going to get rid of them.\u201d", "1472609437000": "Having regained the majority of her composure over the course of the few hours spent orating, Naoki nods solemnly before responding, \u201cQuite right. Even if this doesn\u2019t work out quite as we intend, it will still be a success for the world... and there are always more direct approaches.\u201dWith that done and out of the way for the time being, Naoki leans back into Tristian\u2019s sofa, weaving her fingers together behind her head and stretching a bit. Attempting to turn down the tensions a bit, she continues in a more conversational sort of tone, shifting the subject, \u201cSo, beyond all of that, how have things been going around here? I apologize if I interrupted anything, but I think you can agree that this was a matter of the utmost priority.\u201d", "1472619526000": "Nodding slowly as Tristian brings her up to date with the happenings of The Black Tower, Naoki doesn\u2019t have anything in particular to respond with, that all seeming perfectly reasonable to her. However, as Tristian broaches the topic of a personal matter, Naoki leans forward to rest her elbows on her knees and raises one eyebrow in polite concern, shelving her previous train of thought for one more suited to the situation that seems to be developing. \u201cWell. \u2026 Bursting generally isn\u2019t recommended, but if you\u2019d like to share, I\u2019ll be happy to listen to whatever it is you have to say and offer what assistance I can.\u201d With this, she offers a small smile, intending for it to be interpreted as friendly or perhaps comforting. ", "1472777075000": "Sitting quietly as Tristian changes seats and begins, Naoki listens to the first bit of what he has to say, and nods solemnly in confirmation. Goodness knows he\u2019s contractually obligated to keep all sorts of secrets for her, the least she can do is keep quiet about whatever personal matter he\u2019d like to share. As he continues, Naoki\u2019s lips purse themselves into a small, \u2018o\u2019, the sound of which she replicates softly, \u201cOh.\u201dA moment or so passes as she digests the information, and another before she forms a coherent response, \u201cWell. Congratulations.\u201d Still somewhat surprised, her congratulations aren\u2019t especially enthusiastic. Silently, she muses that thinking back on things later in life, the pair might not be quite happy with the circumstances in which they met. While, admittedly, lots of couples don\u2019t exactly meet in the most romantic of circumstances, not many situations are quite as painful to think about as the funeral for an entire nation. \u201cNow, not with the intention to be rude, but rather out of concern, I must ask\u2026 Are you sure?\u201d Fixing Tristian with a searching look, she continues, \u201cBecause that- marriage, that\u2019s a very serious thing you\u2019re discussing. And I realize that I\u2019m telling you things that you already know, but you\u2019ve only known her for what, a few weeks? Maybe a month? And though she may be be gorgeous, definitely- I agree, are you sure that you know her well enough to seriously consider, and even propose devoting yourself, your life to her?\u201d", "1472789707000": "Listening to his response, Naoki nods slightly, primarily in acknowledgement. She doesn\u2019t say anything for the space of a few moments, but opts to continue, expression blank, tone flat, \u201cThe first time I said it- the first time I told her I loved her, I didn\u2019t mean it. Not truly. She said it first; it was easier to reciprocate the declaration verbally and keep kissing her than it was to fully consider the matter and complete the requisite amount of introspection and truly mean the words I said.\u201dDespite the topic of conversation, Naoki proceeds as if she\u2019s speaking of fact and figures, as opposed to her own most personal feelings; not hesitating or mincing words in the slightest.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t until months after I met her, and a few weeks after I said so that I realized it was true. After numerous dates and many hours spent with her, I was sitting alone, in my office, around midnight, writing about the past day in my journal. In writing, my train of thought meandered toward the future, and in considering how I would like it to proceed, I realized that I would like my future to be with her. From that realization, I eventually reached the conclusion, in consciously evaluating everything I knew about her up to that point, that with all of that considered, I loved her, based upon a relatively full understanding of who she is, which I had acquired gradually over those months. Based upon little things, such as how and when she is charitable, which things upset her the most and how she acts when upset, her principles, morals, and other such aspects of who she is as a person.\u201d\u201cFor as much as I tend to be very quick about hiring strangers and placing them into positions of importance- yourself a primary example, that swiftness is only applied professionally. Personally, I take time- perhaps too much time, to develop personal relationships. Another example can be seen in Skarlet. I\u2019ve still not internally come to terms with the fact that she is my responsibility, my daughter, even though it\u2019s been\u2026 what, a year or so since I adopted her? \u2026\u201dNaoki trails off, thinking back on the date before nodding slowly.\u201cYes, about one year. Anyway, when I\u2019m with her, I\u2019m not quite sure how to act. Often, I end up simply trying to emulate what I think a good mother ought to do, rather than being one myself. Conversely, she seems to have bonded to me about as much as she\u2019s going to.\u201dNaoki offers a defeated sort of shrug, the first display of emotion since she began.\u201cSo, when you- or anyone else, for that matter, come and say, \u2018Oh, I\u2019ve met this wonderful individual last week, and we\u2019re to be married as soon as possible!\u2019, it strikes me as odd. Just because I don\u2019t think in that way- I can\u2019t understand it because my methodology for forming personal relationships is so wildly different. I don\u2019t mean to imply that I think you\u2019ve made a poor choice- that\u2019s not my evaluation to make. Nor do I mean to suggest that you spend more time in making such decisions, or tell you how to live your life in any capacity. It isn\u2019t of any particular concern to me, after all, as I trust you will continue to perform what duties I require of you whether you\u2019re married or not, and regardless of the quality of that marriage. When I ask you, 'Are you sure?' I ask you to see what you say- to see that conviction you just displayed, to attempt to understand how you think, and how you you build up all of that burning conviction in only a few days.\u201dWith that said, it\u2019s Naoki\u2019s turn to fold her hands in her lap and eye Tristian with a lightly questioning sort of look. ", "1472797884000": "Quietly, Naoki looks on as Tristian continues. She notes silently that he\u2019s able to speak of the past, and his brothers, without visibly displaying pain. The Tristian she first met wouldn\u2019t have been able to do that. As he speaks of how he feels toward her, she nods empathetically, sharing some of those feelings in her own way toward Kate. \u201cWell, I\u2019ve said it before, I\u2019ll say it again, and I\u2019ll probably end up saying it quite a few more times before your marriage is all done and squared away, but congratulations. It\u2019s good to see that you\u2019re so pleased with her, so happy, and excited for the future. It\u2019s nice to see you smile, too. \u2018Infinitely charming\u2019, if you will; you should strive to do it more often.\u201dShe offers a slight smile that may have been flirting, were the topic not what it is. Instead, it is intended as advice; something to do for her. \u201cI appreciate the advance notice, and would offer you the same, were the tables turned. I respect her wish to keep the whole thing under wraps, and won\u2019t repeat any of what you\u2019ve mentioned or begin shopping for wedding gifts until after you\u2019ve announced it publicly.\u201dShe pauses for a moment thinking, before crocking one eyebrow up inquisitivley, \u201c... Would you object to silverware?\u201d", "1472884933000": "Sept 2, 2016 10:27:15 GMT -8 Lord Tristian Seryl said:Infinitely charming. The term elicited a surprised expression, at first, and then Tristian grinned, laughing softly. Not a sound often heard from Tristian, or at least it hadn't been. Things were changing for him, it seemed.\"I'm sure I'll have many more reasons to smile in the future, and I'll be sure to make an effort to do so more often.\" He nodded appreciatively as Naoki confirmed that she would keep their secret for the time being, and then chuckled at the mention of wedding gifts. He almost couldn't believe that it was actually happen. There was going to be a wedding. With a reception. And gifts. Rather mind-boggling.\"I don't suppose so? I really haven't given much thought to wedding gifts. We've hardly agreed on anything more than, there will be a wedding, it will be after the summit.\"Tristian's laugh inspires a small smile from Naoki. It would indeed seem as if things are changing for him, and for the better, at that. Good to see, she muses. \u201cWell, you should start thinking about it, or else you\u2019ll be receiving silverware.\u201d She offers a mockingly threatening glare before continuing, \u201cThat, and the event itself. There\u2019s a lot one can do with weddings, a lot of things to consider. How big you would like it to be. What the venue will be, who to invite, what sort of theme you might like it to have, which colors to use for the garments, which set of customs you\u2019d like to use, who to officiate it\u2026 the list goes on.\u201dOffering a small shrug, Naoki continues, \"You\u2019ll have time to puzzle those things out with her at length, I suppose, but it never hurts to have an idea of what you would like to see going into things, at least in a general sense. At the very least, those are all quite pleasant things to consider,\u201d she concludes. The unspoken continuation mentions how Tristian could really do with considering some happy thoughts of that sort, to perhaps work out the creases etched in his face from his ever-present scowl of the last few months.", "1472951835000": "Sept 3, 2016 7:15:21 GMT -8 Lord Tristian Seryl said:Tristian nodded slowly, thoughtfully, as he listened to all the things Naoki mentioned. It was true. There was much to be done involving a wedding that he simply hadn't considered.\"Yes, you make an excellent point. We've been so focused on the summit and making sure her proposal for altering the Black Tower's structure goes smoothly, we simply haven't had the time. I'll have to speak with her about it.. but depending on how soon after the summit she wishes to wed, there may not be time for us to plan anything extravagant. Perhaps I should hire someone to plan the whole thing for us.\" This last was murmured thoughtfully, and then his gaze - which had drifted off to one side while he pondered - flicked back to Naoki. A slight flicker of mischievous mirth flared to life within his earthy hues, and then a smirk tilted his lips.\"I don't suppose you'd be interested in taking on the task? The marriage of a former Queen and the leader of the Black Tower, planned by the High Lady herself... It would be the talk of the nation for years.\" He was clearly just joking. Which was perhaps miraculous in and of itself. Tristian didn't normally do.. jokes. Nyx was obviously having a good influence on him.At Tristian\u2019s suggestion, Naoki exhales sharply through her nose. \u201cYou know, I would, if I weren't just as busy as you are.\u201dShe allows a moment to pass in silence, contemplating the matter. After a moment, she pipes up again cheerfully,\u00a0\u201cThough, it would be my pleasure to officiate the ceremony personally, if you would like.\u201d As the High Lady of Isra, Naoki holds Isra\u2019s Matrimonial Seal, and carries the power to solemnize marriages\u00a0legally in Isra, as well as to invest that power in wedding officiants of her choosing. ", "1473006179000": "Waving a hand dismissively in an attempt to play it off, Naoki responds, \u201cIt\u2019s no trouble, and I\u2019m sure you would do the same, were the tables turned. Just make sure to schedule the event over top of an Assembly Meeting, so I have a good alibi to skip out on one of those meetings.\u201d At this, the conclusion of her own joke, Naoki's eyebrows tilt upward. Silently, she muses that she much prefers chatting with Happy Tristian as opposed to Angsty Tristian or Angry Tristian. It\u2019s almost as if he\u2019s a different man. Continuing her musings, she wonders if Ms. Nyx is the same way, and if she might require assistance in her wedding preparations. ", "1473040222000": "Standing as Tristian does, Naoki accepts his handshake, gripping firmly but warmly- as she tends to, and maintaining eye contact for the duration of the shake. At his offer, she shakes her head, politely declining. \u201cI appreciate your offer, but there\u2019s no need; it\u2019s just down the hall. We\u2019ll be in touch, but if you need anything from a nonprofessional perspective- like someone to cater your event, perhaps, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out. I\u2019ve got contacts, remember.\u201dClapping Tristian on the shoulder, Naoki nods once at him, offering a small smile as if to say, \u2018Congratulations\u2019. She only maintains it for just a moment though, before removing her hand and turning smartly on her heel, moving toward the door. Pulling it open with one hand, she uses the other to offer Tristian a wave over her shoulder. As she moves through the door and pulls it shut behind her, the last visible part of her is the tip of her tail before it disappears beyond the door frame. ", "1504556474000": "High atop The Black Tower, half a mile above ground, the wind whips pretty well, doesn\u2019t it? Such is Naoki\u2019s thought as she emerges onto the rooftop. The sky above is dark; the moon is new. The stone on which she steps is dark, the ground below is dark, and the mountains off in the distance are dark. It\u2019s the middle of the night and Naoki is cautious with her footing. In the center of the roof, The Black Tower\u2019s superweapon - The Kami, sits impassively, its runes glowing slightly in the night to lend Naoki some vision. A unique weapon, it may be most aptly compared to a catapult whose mechanism is not related to leverage or any rational concept of physics, but rather, runic magics of the strongest magnitude. Its missile is not any ordinary boulder, either. The Kami delivers to its target pillars of stone taller than Naoki\u2019s person, themselves covered in runes which function to add to their destructive potential.The Kami is one of the very few things, in Naoki\u2019s opinion, that could reasonably dent The Citadel, such as it is. The Kami has been used in the past to defend Isra from colossal beasts who threatened the city - to great effect. Its mere presence is an excellent deterrent to any wishing to stage a large assault on The Free Plains, making it a valued, if not often used, tool.There\u2019s a certain sense of sobriety in commanding such a weapon, Naoki thinks. One word from her could destroy any given element of the far off Norkari Mountain range or reduce the majority of Isra to ashes. A few more words would flatten it, with all that entails. A real sense of gravity, especially so while she\u2019s standing her next to it. It seems much larger than she remembered, looking at it like this. Naoki considers taking cover from the wind behind one of its pillars. After a moment, she decides not, figuring it best not to tempt the powerful magics, inactive as though they may be.And so Naoki stands alone on the rooftop, wind whipping at her from every direction. Her hair pulled back into a braid, isn\u2019t as much trouble as she thought it might be. However, her choice of attire was\u2026 not among her most wise, Naoki thinks. This is not skirt weather.Crossing her arms over her chest, Naoki squints down toward Isra, mess of lights that it is. The braziers along the walls are easily identified - a dotted outline. The center of the city is brightest, most visible; the outskirts are all but invisible, few torches burn there. A truly unique vantage, this. Naoki can associate a few large points of light with landmarks around the city - that bluish one is the statue in the Central Plaza, for instance.But Naoki didn\u2019t come all the way up here for the view. Impatient, she glances back toward the hatch she emerged from, expecting company.", "1504574351000": "Haru\u2019s approach goes unnoticed until he comes close enough that Naoki hears him. Once she turns and sees him, she smiles and takes a few steps in his direction. She seems unsurprised by his arrival, having summoned him here.\u201cAhhh ha haa,\u201d Naoki murmurs to herself, reaching to pet Haru and return his greeting. Soft kitty is here, and Naoki is always happy to see soft kitty. With one hand, she reaches to scratch that one particular spot he likes, reveling in the softness of soft kitty, the levels of which cannot be understated.Naoki gestures for Haru to seat himself. Once he does, she takes a seat next to him, there on the roof of The Black Tower. Leaning into him, she chuckles a bit more to herself. \u201cYes,\u201d she says, \u201cKitty.\u201dBecause this, this is it, right here. Looking down upon her domain, with soft kitty. This isn\u2019t bad at all, Naoki thinks. There is no warmth without chilliness, which is why it feels much better to be warm in the cold. That\u2019s why The Chalet is built up in the mountains. At least, that\u2019s what Naoki tells herself. The location of The Chalet is of considerable importance for bigger reasons than that, but that\u2019s beside the point.\u201cIt\u2019s good to see you,\u201d Naoki murmurs as an afterthought. She shifts a bit as to snuggle a bit more comfortably and sighs. It\u2019s a contented sort of sigh, a comfortable one. Seated as such with soft kitty, Naoki settles in for the wait, which shouldn\u2019t be too much longer, she thinks.", "1507554513000": "As Grandma approaches, Naoki sits all but entirely still, save for her ears which turn toward the source of the clicking. At the sight of the gem, Naoki finds a smug little smile to match Grandma\u2019s own, evidently quite pleased with the outcome.\u201cMmmh,\u201d she mumbles, \u201cExcellent.\u201d She didn\u2019t expect there to be any trouble, but it\u2019s nice to have that confirmed.At Grandma\u2019s musing, Naoki cocks an eyebrow. That sounds like a topic worthy of a monologue. Is Grandma tempting her..? Looking back out toward the city, Naoki sits quietly for a few moments, considering the matter. It\u2019s an exceedingly nuanced question that she ought to figure out sooner rather than later, but this is neither the time nor place. \u201cI wonder the same, some days,\u201d Naoki says, leaving it at that.Rising to her feet, Naoki spends a moment to stretch, having been seated for such a time. The wind, ever the rascal, proceeds to take full advantage of this opportunity and delivers unto Naoki the most unexpected and gripping of chills. None too much a fan of that, Naoki makes an exclamation of surprise followed by a muttered expletive. Using one hand to keep her skirt in place, Naoki slides the other into her pouch to produce a squarish sort of object, about as large as her palm. It\u2019s metallic with a smooth, dull white color. Latent magic is present within; Naoki activates it by pressing on the top.It does its work within the space of a second. One moment, Naoki is lamenting her choice of attire, skirt flapping this way and that. The next, her outfit has vanished, to be replaced by a magnificent set of dusky orange plated armor. Fashioned by the legendary blacksmith Forgemaster Epirus  , The Empress\u2019s Armor is nothing less than a masterpiece, balancing, form, function, and style well enough to be worthy of its distinction. Almost immediately after appearing, the helmet\u2019s visor CLANGs shut, drawing out another expletive. As Naoki begins to fiddle with the mechanism, she turns back toward Grandma. \u201cI don\u2019t suppose you\u2019ve heard from Reese Cresno , then.\u201d A statement. She glances toward the hatch. Nothing there. Indeed, no skeletons. \u201cRrrrrmmh\u2026\u201d Naoki rumbles, impatient. Here on the metaphorical precipice, the anticipation is mounting.", "1508199719000": "As Reese comes up onto the roof he receives a cool look from Naoki but nothing more than that. Being irritated isn\u2019t productive; not worth the effort. Given that Reese acknowledged his lateness, nothing more is needed, she feels.As such, Naoki quietly looks on as Reese sets up the ritual. Having done some reading of her own, she\u2019s familiar the procedures on an elementary level. Watching, she follows along, noting where and how Reese deviates from the instructions in the book she read, accounting and adjusting for the variables.Once he\u2019s finished, Naoki nods impassively. From some pocket, she produces a large blue sapphire, The Gem, The \u2018Water Gem.' Extending her arm, she offers it to Reese. \u201cDo it.\u201d", "1508361154000": "As the light show begins, Naoki\u2019s visor slams itself shut again, protecting her eyes but also surprising a little squeak out of her. Afterward, she grumbles a bit but continues to watch, even as her bones begin to rattle, and the noise continues to build. At the climax of the event, Naoki is pleased that she put the armor on first - the noise would have deafened her otherwise. She\u2019ll need to remember to thank Eprius for that later - for that and the eye protection. A related thought, perhaps it was a mistake to do this at night. The entire city\u2019s probably awake now, and the giant beam of light coming from atop The Black Tower is sure to raise all sorts of suspicions.But lost sleep is a low cost to pay, and Naoki\u2019s focus is elsewhere. Turning her back to the ritual, Naoki raises a gauntlet in a futile attempt to shade her eyes as she looks out across the land. This is part of why The Black Tower was chosen to be the setting - it affords an excellent vantage. She turns the greater part of a circle before she sees it. The other beam. \u201cIt seeeeems ... as if it\u2019s south of The Expanse, North-Northeast of Meridian. \u2026 Beyond the Eastern Woods.\u201d Naoki silently mouths an expletive. The only practical route over land would be to travel east into The Land Tillers' State, then turn south and walk the entire length of The Expanse. That\u2019s going to be hard walking on a very indirect path; it would take The Legions a matter of weeks to arrive if Naoki\u2019s estimate of the location is accurate.But that\u2019s a matter to be considered later. Turning around to face the ritual once again, Naoki addresses Reese. \u201cI want to leave as soon as possible, prepare the scepter and give it to me.\u201dThe change in Naoki\u2019s attitude is made clear as her voice takes on an authoritative edge. She speaks using none of the warmth and friendliness she usually employs. These are commands, and they sound like it. \u201cAfterward, return to your office immediately and send someone else up here to clean up. I am, as discussed, carrying the scrying focus, and I will have the stronger one set up with all due haste. Deploy any assets you feel appropriate and use whatever means necessary to maintain control.\u201d She pauses, turning to look Reese in the eye sockets. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be surprised.\u201d", "1508827236000": "For three minutes, Lady Naoki makes a show of twiddling her thumbs, rocking on her heels, and looking toward the distant beam of light impatiently. Evidently, there was some lapse in communication wherein she did not adequately express to Reese beforehand her intentions to depart immediately with the staff following the completion of the ritual.Just as soon as Reese returns with the staff, Naoki takes it from him. \u201cBrilliant,\u201d she says, with just the smallest hint of sarcasm.She then moves immediately over to the ritual and unceremoniously plucks the red gemstone right out of the air. When she does, the light around them dims significantly as the ritual\u2019s magic is shaken off the Fire Gem. With it in one hand and the scepter in the other, Naoki spends a moment to, based on the shape of the gem and the shape of the sockets, figure out where to insert the jewel into the scepter. She then does so, taking a small degree of care to ensure it fits in snugly.Lady Naoki then turns to take the next one: the sapphire, the Water Gem. When she does, the light dims significantly further as another component is removed. This gem, too, Naoki slots into its appropriate socket on the scepter; the third follows in short order. The group is then left in darkness, as they were before the ritual began. Naoki gives the scepter a few experimental swings to test her handiwork. Nothing falls off. Considering this satisfactory, she turns to Haru. First, a few comforting pats are in order, because Haru is a very soft kitty and he deserves some pats. Afterward, Naoki proceeds to mount Haru and gesture toward the pillar of light.Lady Naoki offers Reese a curt nod in farewell before tapping Haru twice on the head, signaling him to fly.[Exit to The Amberhills]", "1535075405000": "For the fifth time today, Empress Naoki steps down from her carriage.  This morning, she visited Dawnfire Forges, just in time to see the sunrise cast into molds. After that was the Arena, a surprise inspection of some of the city\u2019s supply warehouses, and then a visit to The Library, followed by a break at the Sun Bath. Isra\u2019s public institutions seem to be managing themselves well enough, but there are improvements to be made across the board. Now, The Empress stands here, on this dirty road, before Dr. Ettinger's Home for the Mentally Infirm, Isra\u2019s premier sanatorium. This is her first visit, never having been acquainted with the Doctor himself, only approving budget proposals submitted in his name. However, she\u2019s heard much\u2014perhaps too much, of what goes on within these creepily-steepled walls. Apparently, they have something they\u2019d like to show her, now, and so The Empress is here to oblige.With a Sentinel on each side and two more already at the door, Naoki approaches Ettinger's, bold as you please. Not that she doesn\u2019t prefer touring about the city to a day spent sedentary on the throne, but whatever it is had better be good enough to warrant this whole setup.", "1535096471000": "\u201cThank me for your budget,\u201d The Empress replies somewhat tartly, taking note of the trained guards and their elaborate masks, as well as the apparent absence of any sort of silencing runes whatsoever.Ears flattened in an effort to muffle the noise, she follows Dr. Ettinger, anticipating the heavy door leading down to the basement.\u201cI\u2019ve been led to understand you\u2019ve done something\u2014\u201d she pauses, interrupted. \u201cSomething useful with it. And so I\u2019ve come to see.\u201d She shrugs slightly, aloof. She has what she thinks to be a good guess of just what sort of thing the good doctor intends to show her, but she\u2019ll indulge his presentation.", "1535248668000": "\u201cYou slight the loyalty of my Sentinels,\u201d The Empress responds, rolling her eyes. \u201cAs if they are not already privy to greater secrets than this.\u201d \u201cBut very well,\u201d she acquiesces with a dismissive hand gesture. To the Sentinels, \u201cNo one passes through here before I return.\u201dThe Sentinels nod, their helmets inclining forward ever so slightly, and adjust their grips on their weapons. The Empress turns back to Dr. Ettinger, \u201cUnless you have anyone that needs to leave before I enter\u2026\u201d She gestures, trailing off. \u201cLead on.\u201d", "1535425125000": "\u201cI\u2019ll save my questions until the end,\u201d The Empress says, taking a position in front of the window.After thinking about it for a moment, she takes a step back, putting a bit of distance between herself and the window. \u201cWhenever you\u2019re ready,\u201d she says, gesturing.", "1535865003000": "At his comment about the bars, The Empress gives Dr. Ettinger a quizzical sort of look and remains exactly where she is.Lady Naoki watches the demonstration with the most placid of expressions, the one she usually reserves for use in times of distress. One eyebrow twitches, trying to furrow, but she doesn\u2019t look away. Aside from, and perhaps more difficult to tolerate than the viscera, there\u2019s a certain sort of weight, of guilt, in knowing that she wrought this. Not directly, but it was she who ordered the expedition, she who approved the investigation of the ruins, and she who budgeted for Dr. Ettinger to conduct his work.It is she who could have this entire operation shut down. But she will not.It would be a lie to say that Project Locust is \"necessary\", but similarly, it cannot be said that it is inefficient. It seems like just any human can, by this ritual Ettinger is on about, can be turned into one of these unstoppable beasts. Terribly, terribly, efficient, even though they\u2019re not entirely controllable as of yet. Using griffins to drop even just a few of these into, say, the camp of an invading army at night\u2026 It would save Isran lives.Because as Naoki has seen, the world doesn\u2019t play fair, and if you don\u2019t want to lose, neither can you. She plays at the biggest table, for the highest stakes, and if it results in what\u2019s best for her People, Naoki will cheat every single day of the week, without hesitation, without mercy. She won\u2019t enjoy doing it and will do everything she can to avoid doing it, but she\u2019ll do it.And so Project Locust will exist, as another card up her sleeve. It will be kept quiet, and she doesn\u2019t have to like it, but it will exist, as a nasty surprise for anyone foolish enough to think that they can topple Isra.\u201cThey\u2019re horrible,\u201d The Empress remarks brightly. \u201cEasily, one of the most terrifying creatures I have seen in recent memory.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019re terrifying weapons. ...\u201d She pauses and watches the locust tearing at the bear for a few moments. \u201cAn outstanding addition to the collection.\u201d She says this mostly to stroke Ettinger\u2019s ego, but she isn\u2019t lying.\u201cWhat methods have you found effective in restraining them?\u201d", "1546997748000": "As Ettinger puts on his macabre show, The Empress grimaces. The bear didn\u2019t need to die. Though she accepts the utility of having such creatures, the whole thing is still repulsive.At his claim of being \u201cadept\u201d at restraining the creatures, The Empress quirks one eyebrow, skeptical. \u201cThrow a bag over its head and have a few burly guys tackle it\u201d isn\u2019t a very good plan and becomes impossible if there\u2019s more than one. In practice, it will take much more.\u201cNo,\u201d replies The Empress, showing Ettinger her palm. \u201cI\u2019ve seen rituals, and I\u2019m sure yours is very nice. There\u2019s no need to go to such trouble on my account.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t enjoy it quite as much as you do,\u201d she adds, almost accusatory. \u201cHow many locusts do you have?\u201d", "1547183434000": "\u201cHa!\u201d The Empress exhales sharply, evidently amused.\u201cAbsolutely not.

A better way to have structured this would have been to have Ettinger as a subordinate of someone sane. This is a dangerous man playing with dangerous weapons without oversight of any sort.

You may underestimate the security of written channels; you probably could have sent a letter to that extent lacking details, but no matter.\u201d\u201cMy initial thought is to devote resources to more thoroughly quarantine the area.

What she thinks of Alden, the work she\u2019s done, her favorite things to eat, and so on. Smoothly in the course of the conversation, Naoki reveals that she had sandwiches prepared and hidden in the carriage earlier, and shares these with both Lamina and the carriage attendants.Then they would turn off the main road and slow down as they start down what must be either a very rough road or an arbitrary line drawn across the plains.

One ear swivels in the direction of the shouting before she does. A hint of frustration passes her expression, irritated for having been interrupted.It\u2019s a member of The Guard, running their way. An attack at the border, he says. Orcs. Naoki\u2019s assumption is such that he must be from some outlying lookout tower or patrol and escaped what must be an attack by an overly bold orc warband. However, she isn\u2019t exceedingly concerned; there are systems in place for dealing with these sorts of things. She trusts that any force capable of sending a member of The Guard running will be spotted and promptly destroyed in whatever manner is appropriate. Attacking Isra has ensured the doom of those orcs.That said, there haven\u2019t been any significant attacks on the border for some time. It may be enough orcs to justify the involvement of Imperial soldiers or the dispatch of magi from The Enclave. She imagines this attack will be mentioned in the report she receives at the end of the week.Squinting for detail, Naoki examines the guard as best she can from a distance. It seems as if he\u2019s running this way. She wonders if he\u2019s wounded. If he is, there may be something in the carriage \u2014 if not, she\u2019s carrying a few spell-gems with healing spells. He can\u2019t be hurt too badly if he\u2019s running and hollering as much as he is, though, she thinks.Wait \u2014 someone is running after him. Someone who is not a member of the guard, but who is armed and armored. Waving his arms around. It seems as if he\u2019s chasing the guard. Who is he? Why is he waving? Is he waving to them? She thinks that unnecessary; the guard got their attention well enough with his hollering. Naoki is unsure what to think of the second man but isn\u2019t panicking quite yet. St. George is standing nearby, and both Liz and Lamina are highly proficient fighters \u2014 though she\u2019s unsure if they\u2019re armed.As the men approach, Lady Naoki takes no action aside from a shift in demeanor, adopting a regal posture, holding one hand in the other behind her back. Though she may not be wearing a crown or any Imperial symbology beyond her ring, she\u2019s able to seem very much The Empress, and she looks promptingly in the direction of the approaching guard, expecting him to stop and explain himself once he\u2019s close enough.", "1513627060000": "Listening, one of Naoki\u2019s eyebrows raises so far it nearly leaves her head. The idea that this idiot was sent to warn her is laughable. That isn\u2019t how things are done. He would have been sent to, at the most, the next tower over, which would have sent out the alert. Guards at the border haven\u2019t the slightest idea of where she is right now; such information is not shared. Especially not now, on an informal excursion. Had he omitted that line, the rest of the man\u2019s story wouldn\u2019t have been immediately cast into doubt.To buy herself more time in analyzing the potential truth in the man's words and deciding if she\u2019s amused enough to show mercy, Lady Naoki turns to Lamina. \u201cWhat do you think we should do?\u201d she asks, with her most neutral of neutral tones. Naoki is interested to hear her take on the situation. ", "1514685032000": "For a long while, Lady Naoki is silent. She looks between the two of them. The liar and the other one. She had hoped to present Lamina with the dilemma to hear her response \u2014 that would have been interesting, but they\u2019ve taken the fun out of that, haven\u2019t they. It was probably wise to confess sooner rather than later, she supposes. Still, the question remains.\u201cHmm.\u201d She keeps them waiting for a few moments longer, drawing it out for the benefit of their apprehension.Taking a single step forward, The Empress thrusts out her palm. \u201cGive me your weapons,\u201d she orders.

Putting a hand on her chin, Lady Naoki deliberates, \u201chmmm\u201d ing loudly for their benefit. For his sake, she pretends as if she didn\u2019t hear Asger\u2019s plea.They haven\u2019t  done anything, in particular, she supposes; their most egregious offense is wasting her time. But it would hardly be befitting of Everyone\u2019s Favorite Benevolent Empress to have them killed for such a crime on empty stomachs.Gesturing over toward the carriage, Naoki raises her voice slightly to address the Carriage Attendants. \u201cBring the remaining sandwiches, would you...?\u201d\u201cYou will eat,\u201d she declares to the fools. \u201cAnd then,\u201d turning to Liz, \u201cWould you happen to have here, on this ranch, stables, and shovels?\u201d Smirking slightly, Naoki suspects Liz will see where she\u2019s going with that.", "1515857317000": "Spinning on her heel, Lady Naoki brandishes a single finger at Dirk and Asger and fixes the both of them with stern looks.She makes as if to say something \u2014 but pauses, and turns to Liz, an eyebrow raised in question.

But if Liz would choose to employ these two legitimately, Naoki won\u2019t deny her the opportunity. ", "1446431254000": "<Enters with Kate Green and Artemis from the Grand Bazaar> Madame Naoki\u2019s sandals crunch against the autumn leaves that blow idly along the ground, as she leads her small party down the road. Behind them, the northern watchtowers of The Free City fall out of sight below a rise as the group proceeds away from the city in a northwesterly direction, towards the distant grey bulk of the mountains. As the distance to their destination, wherever that might be, grows shorter, Naoki\u2019s thoughts fly ahead to the details of the impending picnic. The stiff autumn breeze gusts, teasing the hem of her sundress upwards. She found herself partially regretting her choice of attire. Though, perhaps it would be asking a lot, to have an outfit that would perfectly meet all of her needs today. Thinking about it, the weather would likely put a stop to most activities that could be described as intimate. That\u2019d have to wait for later tonight. However, the chilly air could still be used to her benefit in other ways. The food was well in hand, but as to the possible topics of conversation\u2026 Naoki was drawing a blank. What was one meant to discuss with their\u2026 significant other? Were they even at that stage? What stage was this?She finds herself riddled with doubt. This wasn\u2019t quite like any other outing she had taken anyone on. There wasn\u2019t an ulterior motive, no deals to be closed, no secrets to be divined, this was purely for the enjoyment of all involved. Thinking further, Naoki realizes that she is unaware of a number of basic facts about Kate. Simple things, like favorite color and birthdate. Thinking still further, an interrogation session about small facts would make for terrible conversation. This topic, the topic of topics, if you will, plagues Naoki as she walks; the well worn road slowly transitioning into the open plains. Grassy flats roll up into strange hills that point narrow overhangs northwards towards the mountains like sundials. In front of them, the trees of the forest inch closer with every step. ", "1446510795000": "Madame Naoki is roused from her deliberation by Kate\u2019s melody. The tune seems to roll across the foothills like a warm wind, sweeping Naoki out of her reverie and spiriting her away into the clouds, to alight on some distant, happy shore. From this emotional high, she flashes a smile down at Kate. Artemis\u2019 suggestion prompts Naoki\u2019s eyes to shift, from watching Kate twirl, over to the rock formation Artemis is referring to. All the way from the bottom, all fifty feet to the top.\u201cUp there, you mean?\u201d she remarks, skeptically.The cliff was impossibly high. She hadn\u2019t yet found herself shaken by height, but that wouldn\u2019t be the issue. She would have to get up there before the sheer height could take its toll. Artemis could probably scale the cliff easily, but Naoki and Kate\u2026 Oooh.. Realization of what Artemis is referring to dawns on Naoki. She looks again at the cliff with new eyes. Indeed, the whole mess plateaus at the top; there was suitable space to have the picnic up there.\u201cAh, I see... Excellent idea, Artemis. Kate, you\u2019re not afraid of heights, are you?\u201d", "1446682955000": "Now safely placed up on the plateau, Naoki stands upright, and dusts herself off, stumbling slightly. Such dizzying speed. How Artemis did that sort of thing so consistently was beyond Naoki. Regardless, here they were. Madame Naoki performs a small turn on the spot, taking in their immediate surroundings. At the top of the cliff they just scaled, a small shelf of bare rock gradually gives way to grass and leaf litter. The hill itself stands to the west - and in the shadow of - a larger, similar formation. There are, perhaps, fifty square meters of space available to the group on this particular platform, most of which is relatively flat. Towards the middle of their little plateau, the adjacent outcropping overshadows their own, creating an area of shade.And the view. From the perch, the valley stretches before them like a strategist\u2019s map. At the foot of the mountain, rocky protrusions jut into the happy little trees of the forest. The forest gives way to the green carpet of the plains, which runs all the way to the still-rising walls of The Free City. The buildings within the city huddle together around the Citadel, like chicks pressing around a mother hen. Some notable locations in the city are visible from their unique vantage, such as the Dragon Spire, and the very top of The Midnight Sun, barely visible, peeking around the corner of another building. Beyond the city, to the east, the Silverion River cuts a shining gash in the surrounding hills. Naoki stands motionless for a few silent moments, gazing off into the landscape, contemplating the world at large. And what a world it is, simultaneously so beautiful and so ugly, filled with so many excellent and horrible things. She is roused again from her reverie by Kate\u2019s clapping, and lifts the lid of the picnic basket. Naoki takes from the top the small collection of blankets, and begins to spread them in the shade beneath the overhang, creating a soft spot on which they would hold the picnic, leaving the others to follow her there.", "1446761249000": "Naoki tactfully ignores Kate\u2019s double meaning, and simply answers the question. \u201cThis stuff? No, this is only the food we picked up at the bazaar. I only hired the chef yesterday, today is his first day working; I imagine he\u2019s still setting up. Wouldn\u2019t want to ask him for such an important meal before he\u2019s even found the stove, you know? So we\u2019ll employ his services for dinner tonight.\u201dHaving seated herself, Madame Naoki reaches into the basket once again, and extracts one of the sandwiches. She takes a moment to examine it, not having checked it previously. Judging it to not be harmful, she cautiously takes a bite. Thick slices of salted ham with mozzarella cheese slabs between two halves of a round bun. A bit tough, little bit of a chore to chew, but the taste is there. After chewing for a moment, Naoki moves her right hand to cover her mouth, and speaks again, referring to the sandwich. \u201cS\u2019 not bad.\u201dNaoki decided to opt to say nothing more, taking the \u2018wait and see\u2019 route. Perhaps it would be easier to transition out of a topic, than to bring one up herself. ", "1447061713000": "Naoki scoots on her rear over to Kate, the layers of blankets folding over each other, displaced by her movement. A comforting arm wraps its way around Kate\u2019s shoulders, bandaged extremity hanging down over Kate\u2019s right shoulder. \u201cHey. It\u2019s alright. Don\u2019t fixate on the past. Accept what happened, learn what you can from it, and focus on making your future the best that it can be.\u201dThere was much more to their story than that, of course. Artemis had chosen to omit most of the details; for good reason. If Artemis were to tell Kate the extent of their revenge, or the details regarding the methods they used to enact their vengeance\u2026 Some elements of the past could be glossed over, Naoki thought. She gestures with a sweeping gesture ahead, to the world at large. \u201cFocus on the here, the now, and how they will affect the future. Make a plan for how you\u2019re going to make the future, and then make it reality. Feelings like doubt, grief, regret\u2026 They\u2019re alright, but only in the context of understanding, and planning to proceeding forward without them.\u201dHer words hang in the air for a moment, before Naoki goes on. \u201cSuch is my philosophy, at least. I believe that it\u2019s important to remain positive, and to not allow your effectiveness to be dragged down by something like feelings. Right now, there is only you and I. Only you and I, the blank canvas of the future, and however we decide to fill it in.\u201dNaoki leans closer, and continues in a softer tone.\u201cAnd to me, there\u2019s not much else that matters.\u201d", "1447236139000": "Naoki sighs contentedly, and considers what she might talk about. She doesn\u2019t have very much on her mind, other than Kate. \u201cAlright. Let me think\u2026.\u201dShe could relate a story. But which story to tell? Most of Naoki\u2019s own life experiences wouldn\u2019t make very good stories to tell. Too many of them included copious amounts of deceit on her part, or ended with Artemis committing murder. Not the sorts of impressions she was trying to give. Naoki twitches a bit as Kate begins to play with her ears. Up until this point, nobody has really touched her ears. However, the sensation was not unpleasant. A story from a book, perhaps. Naoki has read a great number of myths and fables, surely one of those would be applicable. Though, thinking though her internal inventory, a great number of those stories end in double suicide, or display undesirable themes, like the futility of life, or the terrible nature of man. Interesting philosophical reads, all of them, but not the types of stories to tell one\u2019s lover.At this point, Naoki resolves to, at her next earliest convenience, obtain and memorize a number of stories that would be suitable to tell Kate in the future. However, this resolution does little to solve her current problem, of what to talk about. Thinking further, Naoki decides that philosophical discussion is probably a viable topic, with the caveat that they discuss the positive aspects of the world. \u201cOkay, I\u2019ve got it. Tell me, Kate. What do you think the nature of happiness is? Is happiness synonymous with being content? Is it synonymous with pleasure~?\u201dNaoki's voice rises a few octaves as her ears, which are evidently rather sensitive, continue to be fondled. She pauses, and clears her throat before continuing. \u201cIs it merely an emotion, that comes and goes through one\u2019s mind? Is it an objective state of being, to be happy? Is happiness, nothing more than the feeling achieved when one reaches their goals?\u201dSmall moans intersperse themselves between her words as Naoki attempts to finish her thought. She shivers against Kate, and clenches her operable fist.\u201cOr, do you think it, ah~, has something to do with others? Is happiness, perhaps, something that caahn~, can only be shared with ahhh~nother?\u201d In spite of the distraction, Naoki manages to finish posing her question. Though, at this point, she is probably unable to continue rational conversation, mind clouded as it is.", "1447343928000": "With a strangled cry, Naoki unravels under Kate\u2019s teeth, holding the other woman tightly as shudders run through her body, before collapsing limply onto the blanket. As she returns to some semblance of consciousness, Naoki finds herself lying on her back, head resting on Kate\u2019s folded knees. Across her field of vision, cirrus shapes silently slide their way across the sky, propelled by the same light wind that ruffles the hem of her dress. In the warm glow of the aftershock, her mind wanders.This must be pretty much it. Perched on an unassailable mountainside on a warm autumn day, joined by her closest partners, with good food and without obligations. From here, how would life improve? How could life improve? What possible enhancements could be made to build on this high, what new peaks did life have to offer? According to Kate\u2019s philosophy, is this Naoki\u2019s own ultimate happiness? Does this climax mark the highest point of her life, the vertex from which the only path is to spiral downwards? Would the forces that be swing her back down from whence she came, back down to the dark pits of poverty and emotional trauma, like some sort of perverse pendulum? Was this the end? These thoughts and others lazily drift their way across the forefront of her mind, much like the clouds across the pale sky. For even at this, the highest of highs, Naoki is unable to find peace with herself. However, Naoki is content, at least partially. This feeling manifests as a sigh, a warm flow of air quietly slipping between her lips. She adjusts herself slightly, to lie more comfortably. Of course, Kate hadn\u2019t really answered her question. Naoki had asked about the nature of happiness, what it is, in its most basic form. What Kate had said was agreeable, certainly, but Naoki was looking for an answer along the lines of, \u201cHappiness is a delusion, a figment of one\u2019s imagination, for the purpose of putting the mind at ease\u201d or perhaps \u201cHappiness is a state of being, in which the individual is satisfied, without pain, regret, or fear\u201d.Personally, Naoki is still unsure of what exactly the nature of happiness may be. Which was, at least partially, why she asked. However, she finds herself forming a new hypothesis as she lies there. \u201cHappiness is believing that one is happy.\u201d She supposes that one stands alone as the sole interpreter of their own life, and if an individual understands themselves to be happy, they are, and there may not be much more to it than that.Under this hypothesis, Naoki supposes that she would be, in fact, happy. Judging this theory to be both agreeable and to her liking, she adopts it as her own. But enough of that. It was time to attend to more pressing matters. In her now stabilized state of mind, Madame Naoki slowly rises, propping herself up on one arm. Kate had caught her by surprise, but now it was her turn. With only a sultry smirk from her lips, Naoki puts the reversal onto Kate, gently pushing her down into the blankets.Naoki\u2019s lips come down to meet Kate\u2019s in a searing kiss, as the two women begin to lose themselves in each other.", "1447530572000": "Naoki\u2019s hand ceases its exploration as they lock eyes. Naoki reflects for a fleeting moment on this newly discovered beauty she finds herself lost in, the endless amber fractals that compose Kate\u2019s irides.Without hesitation, she replies in an equally tender tone, \u201cAnd I, you.\u201d Naoki had come to accept her feelings earlier, and had suspected that Kate shared these feelings, but hearing them expressed verbally, and responding in kind\u2026 There is no superior, more fulfilling feeling, to that experienced when the object of your love sincerely and passionately reciprocates your feelings for them. The feelings Naoki has for Kate cannot be accurately compared to sparks, or a flame; but rather to a great bonfire, a gasoline blaze raging within her heart. Feelings of such intensity, such overwhelming fervor, the likes of which she has never experienced before, and will likely never experience regarding any other subject.The next few hours are consumed by this ardent blaze, spent in the best possible manner. Neither aware of the passage of time, neither looking beyond these compassionate moments shared with the other. However, after a while, they surface from their bottomless sea of passion, and the world of reality comes into hazy focus. Naoki brings herself to sit upright, and greets the world with a dazed smile, lazily taking stock of what the world has been up to while she was otherwise occupied.

Looking up, the sun has indeed come a great way in its journey across the sky, and is now threatening to pass out of view behind the mountains. She supposes that losing track of time is only natural, in a situation such as hers.As if to highlight the passage of time, a gust of chilly, autumn wind whips its way across the rock face. Naoki, now neither clothed, nor sharing warmth with Kate, takes the full brunt of this arctic assault. She hastily drops her arms down around her chest, shivering. \u201cIt is.\u201dAn arm covered in goosebumps reaches to seize the proffered garment, and Naoki hastily dresses, crisp air overpowering the warm afterglow. After a handful of moments, she stands, albeit shakily, fully clothed. Looking around again, she notices the absence of the picnic basket. \u201cArtemis\u2026 did you eat the... the entire picnic basket?\u201d Her accusation degrades into a chuckle, Naoki doesn\u2019t really give a flying feather what happened to the picnic basket. \u201cWe should really get back, though, as not to miss dinner.\u201d Madame Naoki would wait for Kate to dress, offering assistance where it would be applicable but not obstructing. She would gather a few of the less-soiled blankets, and wrap them around their shoulders, makeshift cloaks to take the edge off the whipping winds. Once all matters were attended to, Madame Naoki would exit with the others, and waddle back to the city.<Exit to The Midnight Sun>", "1454796377000": "Now safely standing up on the rock outcropping, Madame Naoki takes a moment to turn back, and admire the view once more.  The vista has changed, with the addition of snow, and lit by the light of the moon, as opposed to the noonday sun. The quiet white blanket draped across the world is like a new style of makeup, highlighting new features of the same scene. Familiar, yet fresh, and just as breathtaking as it was the first time.The waves of heat emanating from the lantern removes the accumulated snow from the shelf as Naoki waves it around, the residual water draining away off the sloped surfaces into crevices in the rock or evaporating in the heat of the lantern. It is a very satisfying feeling, clearing the snow in this way, she finds. Before long, a sizable portion of the rock outcropping is dry.With no more need to hold the lantern herself, she takes it in two hands, and with a dainty grunt and a shoving motion, stabs the pointed end of the stick into a crack in the rock, roughly in the center of the outcropping. She cautiously releases her grip, and immediately, the crook begins to slide. Taking it back up again, she repeats the motion, with more force, and another grunt. This time, the lantern sticks in place, held upright between the two sides of the crack.Planting her hands on her hips, Naoki surveys the area, and nods, satisfied with her work.", "1454885337000": "From the bag, Naoki extracts a thick, red tartan blanket. She unfolds it, and carefully spreads it out a short ways from the lantern, away from the edge. Weighing the corners down with a couple of small rocks, she moves the backpack into the center of the blanket, and seats herself on one side, careful not to get her wet boots on the cloth.Again reaching into the bag, she fishes around for a moment, before pulling out a book. A creased, crimson volume, the silver lettering on the front reads 'Observations of an Immortal'. She places the selected book onto the blanket at her side, and shifts her gaze back upward to see how Raulio is faring with the easel.", "1454895836000": "\u201cOf course, of course.

Like a great perch from which to look down on everything that matters. Now that Raulio is situated with his supplies, Madame Naoki takes a more comfortable seat on the blanket, kicks her boots off to the side, and cracks open her book. There she will sit, reading, for the next few hours, until Raulio finishes his painting, or she is approached.

I assume he lives in Gauldin. He may have moved; he may be on the move. He didn\u2019t quite give me a street address, in the short conversation we had. But perhaps we\u2019ll see him. There\u2019s some manner of psionics in play, if I recall correctly. Keep your mind\u2019s eye open, I suppose.\u201dShe offers a small shrug. Meeting with Ranis is not one of the reasons the trip was planned. If any such meeting occurs, it will be categorized under (hopefully) pleasant surprises. It might do Skarlet some good to speak with him. It might uncover memories she would rather not have, but there\u2019s also something to be said for the feelings of familial belonging and complete knowledge of one's past. Or so Naoki hears, at least. \u201cAlso, along with us I\u2019ve invited Liz. Or, rather, High Commodore Elizabeth Finch of the Dawn Riders.\u201d Naoki\u2019s tone is slightly mocking as she recites Liz\u2019 full title for what is probably the first time. \u201cYou could probably just call her Liz if you ask first, though. I\u2019ve invited her along because she\u2019s one of those very hardworking types, you know? Nose to the grindstone; has been working hard constantly for the past few years. And she needs a break. So I figure we\u2019ll take her over and dress her up in fancy dresses and stuff her full of wine and odorous cheeses, as one tends to in Gauldin.\u201dShe pauses for a moment, contemplating the mental image and smirking slightly. \u201cOught to be fun,\u201d she concludes.", "1468783815000": "\u201cHm.\u201d Naoki pauses for a few moments, considering her encounter with Ranis and her impressions based off it. \u201cHe seemed to me, when I spoke with him, to be a pensive and mysterious sort. That impression might be based on the circumstances I met him in. It wasn\u2019t as if we sat down and shared a meal or anything. Our time was limited, and focused primarily on his explaining to me what was going on.\u201d\u201cIf I were to extrapolate, though\u2026 I would guess that he would be a fair sort of person. The sort of person with a personal code. One with elements relating to protecting his friends, but more or less indifferent toward strangers. I would guess that he\u2019s somewhat lonely, and either has a small group of friends- perhaps fellow vampires, or lives a solitary sort of lifestyle.\u201d\u201cIf we happen across him, I would guess that he would watch us for a while, unseen. Sizing us up. He hasn\u2019t met you, and I think before introducing himself, he would take some time to watch you. If or when he does introduce himself, I would expect him to do it somewhere semi-privately. An alley or something, perhaps, depending on where we are. I think he might doff his hat- he was wearing a cavalier cap when I saw him- and bow with a flourish. He seemed to be something of a gentleman. Might make a show of that, with some hand-kissing, perhaps. Perhaps not. Like I said, I didn\u2019t spend very much time with him. All I have is extrapolation. We\u2019ll have to see.\u201dWith a slight shrug, Naoki stops speaking. She shifts a bit in her seat, and reflects on the probability of meeting Ranis on their trip. Statistically speaking, it ought to be highly improbable. Lots of individuals come and go from Gauldin. Thousands of people walk their streets. The probability of happening across one man- one vampire, should be pretty low, especially so considering that he\u2019s most likely somewhere secluded. Yet, there still exists that psionic\u2026 thing. Of which Naoki is more or less entirely unaware of the details of. It may be such that Ranis has the ability to sense Skarlet from hundreds of miles away. It may be such that she has the same ability, but doesn\u2019t know it. There exist too many unknowns to form a proper conclusion, Naoki resolves. And that\u2019s slightly irritating. ", "1468887970000": "Once again, Naoki nods. \u201cThis will be your first time leaving Isra. I\u2019ve been to Gauldin a few times before, and I think you\u2019ll enjoy it. I don\u2019t care much for the way they do things in terms of politics and policies, but there are lots of things to do in the cities at night. The reasonable cities, at least. Like I said, it ought to be fun.\u201dJust then, the carriage lurches back into motion, and carries on through the gate into the port city and toward the waterfront.", "1468893364000": "On that same overcast morning, Madame Naoki\u2019s carriage arrives at the docks of Port Silverion with minimal fanfare. Beyond the carriage itself, only a pair of mounted Sun Marshals are present. A few moments after the carriage comes to a halt, the rear door opens, and Naoki is the first one to exit, opting to hop directly from the carriage to the ground, as opposed to utilizing the ladder. She lands on her feet, as she tends to, and moves from the floor of the ladder before taking a moment to look around. This is the naval portion of the docks, where all of the vessels belonging to the Isran are docked. At present, they number a paltry few. As far as she can see, only a handful of frigates and a pair of ships-of-the-line.  As Naoki understands, the shipyards upriver are still under construction, and construction of the fleet hasn\u2019t yet begun in earnest. Hopefully, by this time next year, each of these piers will be home to a magnificent warship. Until then, however, options are limited and not very impressive-looking. A solid enough start though, Naoki figures. Definitely more of a navy than Isra was able to boast a few months previously. With her examination of the immediate area complete, Naoki turns back around to the carriage, and up to the skies. Before they can proceed to the ship chosen for their trip, Artemis and Skarlet would need to disembark from the carriage with their luggage, and Liz would need to arrive. Awaiting a development of some sort, Naoki simply stands, continuing to idly cast her gaze about. ", "1468957756000": "\u201cGood morning, Liz; good morning, St. George. The ride over here was short and uneventful, the road seems satisfactory. As for these docks, though\u2026\u201dNaoki trails off, gesturing to the area around them at large. As if on cue, the morning silence is punctuated by some out-of-sight sailor cursing loudly at something. Additionally, a seagull comes to find purchase on a nearby crate of some description, and proceeds to defecate upon it while maintaining eye contact with Naoki.Naoki is silent for a few moments longer before continuing, in a slightly lower tone, \u201cNot quite the shining bastion of magnificent naval might I paid for, but I\u2019m sure they\u2019re working on it. They had better be.\u201dDropping the thought, Naoki glances first behind her, at Skarlet, apparently loaded up with belongings, and then over at St. George\u2019s saddlebags, visibly filled. She nods slightly, mostly to herself. \u201cIt seems like we\u2019re all about prepared to leave. The only question now is what to do next. I informed naval command that I intended to take this voyage at this date and time, so, hopefully, one of these ships ought to be prepared for our departure. We just need to figure out which one it is.\u201d", "1469004200000": "Though Naoki is actually rather surprised to see Gothmog  spontaneously rise from behind a stack of crates that really shouldn\u2019t be large enough to conceal 400 pounds-worth of orc, she doesn\u2019t show it, instead opting to spin about to face him and offer a small nod, in response to his salute turning her head upward slightly to make eye contact. \u201cAh, so I see. We are, yes.\u201dTurning halfway back about, Naoki begins introductions. \u201cEveryone, this is Captain Bloodsail; Captain Bloodsail, this is High Commodore Finch, and Skarlet, my daughter, both of whom who will be accompanying me. Artemis is still handling the luggage, and ought to be along presently. What is the status? Should we board now, or?...\u201dNaoki trails off, unsure if there\u2019s any particular sort of terminology that ought to be used. Hopefully they wouldn\u2019t need to sit around for too long, and could get underway with all due quickness.", "1469072959000": "An eyebrow is raised at Gothmog\u2019s mention of an adjacent room for Liz. One could walk from one end to the other in only a few minutes. An temporary, adjoining room on the top deck for Liz to sleep in sounds like it would be highly extraneous, and leaky, besides. But, Naoki supposes, she isn\u2019t quite the naval architect, is she? There would still (hopefully) be room in her cabin for Liz, anyway.However, what she was really looking for from Gothmog was an estimated time of departure. If they could go ahead and board now and not be in the way, or if they should wait for an hour or two more while the ship continues loading for another hour or two. Rather than asking this directly, and perhaps getting caught in a discussion she isn\u2019t quite prepared to have about the specifics of preparing a ship for departure, Naoki decides that they\u2019ll just board the damn ship. \u201cWell. Then let\u2019s go ahead. Artemis will catch up.\u201dWith a hand motion that doesn\u2019t necessarily disclude Gothmog, but isn\u2019t intended as an order in case he has other things to be doing, Naoki suggests that the group follow her as she leads the way toward the ship Gothmog identified as the Dakota. She pauses at the gangplank as two men carry some manner of crate aboard, and proceeds to follow them up onto the ship\u2019s deck. She doesn\u2019t linger at the top of the plank, instead choosing to cross directly over to an area of the deck that doesn\u2019t seem to be in the way of anyone doing anything important. Her balance seems unaffected even as the ship rolls slightly; her tail easily compensates. Once waiting for everyone to follow her up and for Skarlet to find her way to her side, Naoki begins to speak, \u201cReady for some naval education, Skarlet?\u201d Without waiting for a response, Naoki continues, \u201cLike Captain Bloodsail said, this is what they call a \u2018ship of the line\u2019.\u201dNaoki taps the deck with her toe, indicating the ship that they\u2019re currently standing on, what with its large size, and incredible armament, relative to the other vessels present.\u201c...Which sounds like a bit of funny name, considering that the ship itself doesn\u2019t seem very much like a line, but it\u2019s actually a descriptive name relating to how the ship is designed to be used in combat. You see how all along the side of the ship, there are a whole bunch of ballista, pointed outward? The idea is such so that you take a few ships like this one- the more the merrier, and line them up end to end, like ducks in a row, and then sail the whole line past whatever it is you\u2019d like dead, and shoot it to hell with all of your side-mounted weapons. Hence, \u2018ship of the line\u2019, because you use it in a line of ships. Or a line of battle. Or however else you might want to term it.\u201d\u201cWhen they\u2019re all finished, Isra ought to have seventeen of this type of vessel, as one of the primary components of the fleet. Those smaller ones down there,\u201d Naoki continues, pointing to the ship directly adjacent to their own, \u201c...those are frigate-built warships, which means that they were built with speed and maneuverability in mind. The name comes from the Prizzian word \u201cfregata\u201d, which means essentially the same thing. We\u2019re going to be using them primarily- both in this instance and in the broader sense of Isra\u2019s naval strategy, as escorts. For trade convoys and such. We\u2019ll have twenty-four of those, once all is said and done and barring any accidents.\u201dNaoki spends a moment squinting off the side before pointing off down the docks, intending to indicated one of the docked ships \u201cAnd then, way down there, you see that squarish-looking one, with only a few ballista? That ship isn\u2019t intended to fight for itself, but rather to carry griffins into battle! A carrier, if you will. Each one can carry a whole bunch of griffins like St. George here, as well as their riders and support staff. It\u2019s basically a big stable on a boat, but it\u2019s an incredible tactical asset. Can you imagine, sailing about on the open sea as an enemy of Isra, and then being set upon by a whole company's worth of armored griffin riders, riding out of the sun, spears gleaming? Because the ships, they\u2019re not equipped to fight griffins. They\u2019re equipped to fight ships; ballista don\u2019t shoot up, and griffins are fast. And even marines aren\u2019t really prepared to fight off the sheer, magnificent force that is an armored griffin with rider. The hope is that some of Liz\u2019 specially trained units will be able to land on and kill the crew of enemy vessels without significant threat of retaliation. It ought to be highly effective, and I hope to see it in action at some point.\u201dThose familiar with the cat-woman might note a hint of pride creeping into her voice as she speaks about the carriers. The idea was, at least to some extent, hers, and to see it enacted and seemingly quite promising is somewhat fulfilling.\u201cOh, and there are also schooners, these tiny ones. They\u2019re just light sailing ships with mounted weapons, really. Can carry some cargo, too. Not too much to say about them, other than they\u2019re cheap and numerous. I'm not really sure where the name comes from. We\u2019ll have a bunch of those as part of the navy, too. It ought to be a damn fine navy, once it\u2019s finished.\u201dWith that, Naoki nods solidly, mostly to herself, and concludes her impromptu lecture, leaning against the ship\u2019s railing, and keeping one ear in constant motion, monitoring the various movements and activities as the sailors prepare to depart.", "1469208251000": "Presumably, Artemis boards the ship in due time, bringing with her the luggage. After the personal belongings of her group have been stowed away, and everything seems to be in order, Naoki turns to address Gothmog, \u201cWe are prepared to get underway whenever you are, Captain. Please proceed at your leisure.\u201d", "1476709786000": "Standing there toward the end of the dock, Lady Naoki, clad in her recently acquired armor, watches, silent and largely impassive. However, a slight smirk is present, as things tend to be with her. Truthfully, there are also some non-zero amounts of pride and excitement present. Months ago, she hired the leadership of Isra\u2019s navy and told them that she wanted to rule the seas. Now, this behemoth of a ship stands before her. Large, in charge, and all but ready to firmly establish Isra as the naval superpower of the world.As Gothmog approaches, Naoki removes the smirk and nods somberly in response to his salute. She considers asking if the ship is ready, just to hear him say that it is, but decides not to bother. Figuring that all of these sailors milling about are supposed to be the crew, Naoki figures that they\u2019ll probably have to board the ship before it is prepared to depart. With this in mind, she steps off to the side, to the right of the gangplank, and holds her hands behind her back. Internally, she remarks that it would probably be awfully difficult to swim in this armor, despite it being enchanted so, and as such, is careful not to stand too close to the edge. Though she doesn\u2019t offer any commands to Gothmog, trusting him to proceed about things in the best way, it doesn\u2019t seem like Lady Naoki intends on doing much more unless suggested to until it is time to board. It doesn\u2019t seem like Naoki has noticed any varieties of furry beasts or Celandine women yet through the crowd of sailors. Further away from the ship, out of the way, a mixed collection of Sun Marshals and Citadel Honor Guards seem to be standing around a pile of crates and assorted suitcases, responsible for Naoki\u2019s luggage and the physical International Accord of Universal Rights and Protections, respectively. They also seem content to stand by until it is time to board. ", "1476833724000": "Standing by as the sailors snap into action, Naoki seems pleased. Though she doesn\u2019t personally agree with Gothmog\u2019s methods of motivation, the efficiency is undeniable, and Naoki has never quite been one to worry too much about the means if the ends are to her satisfaction.  Turning to eye the wildebeest and its rider as they approach, Naoki surmises that the woman must be Ying-Na of the Acacia, as no one else looking like she does would have any excuse to be here, on the docks. As Naoki hears, the woman is Jun\u2019s mother and one of the very best archers in The Expanse. Also apparently a diplomat of some description, though Naoki finds that last bit somewhat harder to believe as she observes the woman. As Ying-Na approaches closer and completely ignores her, Naoki\u2019s eyebrows wrinkle a bit in irritation. While she would have appreciated a formal introduction, some manner of acknowledgment would have sufficed. A nod. A wave, or a simple, \u2018Hey\u2019. But apparently not. Fine. Fair enough. Continuing to stand beside the gangplank silently, Naoki says nothing, leaving Gothmog to answer the woman\u2019s question. ", "1477186340000": "Opting not to verbally address Ying-Na\u2019s compliment, Naoki instead extends her own gloved hand to shake the woman\u2019s. Just as she\u2019s opening her mouth to respond, Ying-Na\u2019s other hand whips out to catch the bird droppings. Quite surprised, Naoki recoils to the side, thinking that she was about to be struck. Turning her head to see the bird droppings, she relaxes slightly and straightens. Facing Ying-Na properly, Naoki returns her bow with a nod, and responds, \u201cLikewise. Thank you. I\u2019ve heard a lot about you, and look forward to our journey.\u201dAs Indigo moves to go for some tongue action, Naoki places her palm on the length of his snout, gently pushes him down, and attempts to utilize her other hand- still gloved, to scratch at the top of his head. ", "1477372843000": "\u201cWe are, yes.\u201dAs she scratches, Naoki continues, \u201cThe purpose of the trip is twofold. Firstly, though their King Averin was able to sign The International Accord of Universal Rights and Protections on the behalf of his people, \u2018his people\u2019 only refers to the humans of Alban. Their Dwarves and Fae- the other two factions of Alban, have their own leaders, which need to sign the agreement themselves for it to be properly ratified across the country.\u201dThough clearly not in the mood for face-licking, Naoki permits Indigo to approach a bit closer, and transitions her scratching back to behind one of his ears, and down the length of his neck, figuring that he might take well to be treated in a similar manner to horses. \u201cAnd seeing as how I\u2019ve never visited the nation ot met with the Dwarven or Fae leaders, rather than simply sending The Accords via a messenger to be signed and sent back, I\u2019m leading this joint embassy sort of thing to go visit and have them sign it.\u201d\u201cAlso, this will double as the maiden voyage of my flagship, here.\u201d With one hand, Naoki gestures toward the massive bulk of The Depravity behind them- as if there could be any doubt what she\u2019s referring to.\u201cOur itinerary is flexible but looks something like this\u2026 We\u2019ll depart in the next hour or so. It ought to take about three days of sailing to get from here to Alban. We will dock at their city of Avelius, perhaps briefly meet with Averin, and proceed from there inland to meet with the Fae and Dwarves in whichever order is convenient.\u201d Though the eye contact she maintains with Ying-Na seems casual enough, Naoki watches to see how she takes to this information, if she considers it of any importance.", "1477488443000": "\u201cThat, yes, and also to act in some capacity as a representative of The Land Tillers\u2019 State. Putting a bit of emphasis on the international and all but unanimous acceptance of The Accords is good- as is bringing a token representative of another nation.\u201dIn hindsight, Naoki supposes that being told that your job is to be a bodyguard and token representative isn\u2019t exactly the best thing to be told- but it\u2019s the truth, and Ying-Na doesn\u2019t strike Naoki as one who would want things sugarcoated. Beyond that, however, Naoki is mostly unprepared to address Ying-Na\u2019s questions. Though she had played a role in the design of the ship, it wasn\u2019t a particularly involved one, and though she may be able to find her way about based on the plans, she isn\u2019t sure of such specifics of what all has been finished and prepared for use. To this end, she addresses Gothmog with a simple question, \u201cWhen will the ship be ready to depart?\u201d", "1478413612000": "Turning to greet the last member of her group, Naoki responds, \u201cIsn\u2019t it, though?\u201dTaking a half step backward to stand with Alli, Naoki takes a moment to appreciate the ship anew. Beyond being a monument to naval engineering and the power of Isra\u2019s industry, The Depravity also speaks to Naoki\u2019s ability to have things accomplished. A year previous, she began toying with the concept of having a ship. Today, the finest warship to ever sail the known seas departs on its maiden voyage. In any case, it\u2019s about time to be boarding. \u201cYou\u2019re not late at all, it\u2019s time to board.\u201d Beckoning for Alliandre to follow, Naoki proceeds up the ramp and onto the ship. As much as she is excited to explore the ship and her quarters and such, she opts to remain topside long enough to see the ship leave port. To this end, she selects a position a short ways portside of the helm, which she figures would have a respectable view but not be in the way of anyone important. Simultaneously, the Sun Marshal/Citadel Guard group would ferry aboard their respective items, and proceed to take them belowdecks to be put somewhere or another. Once prompted, Naoki would confirm to Gothmog that as far as she\u2019s concerned, they can leave whenever, and should do so as soon as the rest of the ship is ready. ", "1478582701000": "Remaining in place as the ship pushes away from the dock and begins its journey out to sea, Naoki can\u2019t help but feel more than a little smug, for the same reasons she appreciated the vessel. When she sails somewhere, she sails in a ten thousand ton warship the likes of which have never before sailed the known seas. Is it an inefficient way to use the Navy\u2019s budget? Perhaps.Perhaps. But Shock and Awe is a legitimate doctrine, dammit, and making a ship of this class- just to make it, was a test of Isra\u2019s manufacturing capabilities and the limits of today\u2019s engineering. Pushing those limits is good, and\u2026 productive and such, and nobody has the authority to say otherwise. However, there\u2019s only so much to see on the weather deck of the vessel, so after The Depravity has well and truly left the port and seems to have reached its cruising speed if you will, Naoki nods a farewell to Gothmog before heading belowdecks, trusting Alli to follow. ", "1559351093000": "The Empress\u2019s Carriage arrives. It\u2019s easy to distinguish on account of its unique armored construction and mounted escort, in addition to the heralds proclaiming its arrival. After a moment, the door opens, and The Empress emerges, blinking. For this occasion, she has chosen to wear a long, double-breasted overcoat in what other than deep red. She steps down into a formation of Imperial Sentinels and takes a few steps away from the carriage. The formation moves with her and bends to accommodate as she stretches.  The ride from Isra to Port Silverion was of trivial length in comparison to the coming voyage, but it\u2019s always good to stretch after a nap. The Empress gestures for the formation to part such that she might survey the docks. \u2026 It seems as though the ships are more or less prepared. Sails are hung, flags are flying, crates are being stowed, and ah\u2014there\u2019s Gothmog. Difficult to miss, he is. Acknowledging the captain with a nod, The Empress glances back toward her carriage and behind it, where the second carriage has arrived with her trunks. They\u2019ll need those along with the rest of her entourage before departing, but she isn't in any particular hurry. ", "1559709340000": "Ears pivoting this way and that, The Empress observes quietly, nodding to Calgary when he approaches. There isn\u2019t anything particularly pleasant about the docks themselves, but it\u2019s very easy to feel pride in this display of Isran might\u2014and her new ship! It was determined some ago that The Empress would need another ship. The Depravity is the biggest and best, but to sail it requires hundreds of trained sailors. For times like these, The Indulgence is a more modest affair in size only. While retaining the shape and most important features of a warship, it is seemingly unarmed, having instead devoted that space to bedrooms, a dining hall, and even a spa. While she did briefly inspect the ship at its ceremonial launch, this will be its first voyage, and The Empress is very much looking forward to it. But before that, introductions are in order.\u201cGothmog, this is Deidra Nofal\u00f3. Crown Princess of Edan. Deidra, this is Gothmog Bloodsail \u2014 a finer captain you\u2019ll not find. \u201d Naoki gestures from one to the other and back. \u201cIt will be between the two of you to successfully navigate us through The Mists.\u201dBased on what she\u2019s heard from Deidra and her knowledge of how these things tend to work, The Empress doubts that the entire flotilla will reach Edan. Deidra herself can only be on one ship, and large expeditions into The Mists have historically\u2026 not gone well, let\u2019s say.Regardless, that\u2019s one worry that Naoki isn\u2019t responsible for. She ordered the ship to be loaded with extra supplies; even if they are separated from the fleet, The Indulgence ought to be able to carry out her mission and return safely. \u201cI will see to it that these things are stowed properly,\u201d The Empress declares, motioning toward her luggage, now making its way down the dock. \u201cJoin me at your leisure, and we can depart just as soon as we\u2019re ready.\u201d", "1577019157000": "The carriage ride to Port Silverion is bumpy but otherwise uneventful. Naoki comments that the weather seems good for sailing, if a bit chilly, and resolves that she will have this road paved in the coming year, such that it won\u2019t be so hellishly bumpy next time.As The Empress\u2019s procession enters the Port, the on-duty guards stand at attention and salute as The Empress passes. She doesn\u2019t see, as the curtains are drawn, but she hears them. Naoki listens intently as they pass through the gate, ears up and swiveling. She hears the clip-clop-clip-clop of horseshoes on cobblestone, certainly, but of more interest to her are the other sounds \u2014 or lack thereof. They pass what she knows to be a busy market, but hear nothing. Not the usual cacophony of noise and hollering of a market, not clapping and cheering, nothing. Outside, everyone has paused what they\u2019re doing to watch the carriage pass. It\u2019s not wholly silent, a few are bold enough to clap, but you're not supposed to be able to hear the gulls.Naoki frowns. This silence says a lot about how her people perceive her, and she doesn\u2019t like it. It would probably help if she were visible and waving, but she doesn\u2019t want to embarrass Keph. Support is stronger in the city, but out here it seems as though she is feared more than she is loved.The smell of seawater grows stronger by the minute, and it isn\u2019t long before they reach the Naval dockyards. Now out of the public eye, Naoki opens the curtains and slides over to better see the ships as they pass by outside. There are the single-masted schooners, the larger frigates, and the larger-still Ships of The Line, taller than a house and brimming with ballistae. They pass by rows upon rows of ships; more piers are occupied than not. Only a small portion of the Imperial Navy\u2019s vessels are at sea, and the rest are here collecting barnacles.But at the far end of the dock, The Depravity puts them all to shame. It is comically large in comparison to all the other vessels, dwarfing even the Ships of the Line with its incredible bulk. Four piers are necessary for the mammoth vessel: one high and one low on both sides. It would be troublesome to try to count all of the masts, and one can only guess how many ballistae the ship could sport in times of war, upwards of a hundred, certainly. Though today The Depravity sits silent, a sleeping giant.On the next pier over, in The Depravity\u2019s shadow is moored The Indulgence, which \u2014 though much smaller \u2014 hardly seems modest in comparison. When compared to the ships around her, The Indulgence is a golden apple amongst potatoes. Though the other vessels are not necessarily dirty or in disrepair, The Indulgence, with its spotless red paint, pristine white sails, and extensive gilding, projects the very essence of opulence. Millions of gold must have gone into its construction; The Indulgence is entirely unapologetic about being the finest and by far fanciest example of naval engineering in the seas.As promised, most of the preparation is already done. The sails are ready, the crew has boarded, and the carpet has been rolled down the gangplank. Only the cooks have yet to board \u2014 they\u2019re off to one side, panicking that their delivery hasn\u2019t arrived yet.Mere moments after the carriage stops, the footman places stairs for her majesty to exit. But Naoki doesn\u2019t move. Instead, she looks to Keph and motions to the door. \u201cReady?\u201d", "1579644566000": "Disembarking the carriage with the apple in her pocket, Naoki adopts the title of Empress, standing up a little straighter, moving with the dignity and purpose she is known for. She makes a point of maintaining the royal pretense with so many eyes on her and does so with relative ease. Even so, she registers Keph\u2019s reaction with some amount of concern. She expected him to be impressed, but not\u2026 alarmed. \u201cIt\u2019s rather large, isn\u2019t it?\u201d She teases, mostly because it seems appropriate to do so. He mouths something, but she doesn\u2019t catch it.Once they\u2019ve boarded and she\u2019s received the nod from Keph, The Empress signals to the captain who, in turn, sounds the order to cast off. The sailors launch into action, withdrawing the gangplank, undoing the mooring lines, and bringing down the mainsail. Within moments the ship is off, picking up speed as it starts out of the harbor.When she looks over, Keph is still looking pale. Naoki frowns. That won\u2019t do. Interposing herself between Keph and The Depravity, Naoki pulls Keph into an impromptu hug, squeezing him close for a moment before stepping back (creful not to impale herself on his spikes). Given that she\u2019s wearing boots on top of the height difference, she thinks that ought to be an effective remedy to his paleness. That done, Naoki smirks and beckons toward the front of the ship, suggesting that he follow.[Exit to Isra - Meridian Sea Lanes]", "1562207433000": "Ducking under the last low-hanging branch, Empress Naoki emerges from the forest. Brushing a crinkled leaf off her cloak, she glances behind her, where Rudiger Dornmauer shouldn\u2019t be far behind. Though he was announced as Duke back at The Summit, he isn\u2019t prepared to assume the title quite yet. The fact that Rudiger hasn\u2019t been to his homeland in years, for example, is fairly significant and should be rectified before his coronation. To this end, Empress Naoki has decided that the two of them will tour Voruta on foot in order to best acquaint themselves with the territory and the issues facing its people.She thinks it will be a productive trip. As Duke, Rudiger will be expected to improve Voruta, but the manners in which he does so will ultimately be his decision. By discussing what they see and what he might do about it as Duke, Naoki will be able to get a glimpse into how he thinks and correct him if he goes too far astray. She thinks herself to have a great deal of wisdom as far as ruling and policymaking is concerned, and this ought to be an excellent way to impart it on her newest vassal.Looking out across the field they now find themselves at the edge of, Naoki hums in consideration. She asked that they be placed just inside the Eastern Forest, such that they might approach from the east and see the obstacles that stand in the way of invaders. Off to their right, that would be The River Venta, and, if she\u2019s oriented herself correctly, Lake Plattelia and Voruta City should be some distance straight ahead. Of course, approaching this way means they run the risk of encountering said invaders, so Naoki doesn\u2019t loiter. She immediately starts across the field, expecting Rudiger to follow.It\u2019s only to Torrin\u2019s frustration that Empress Naoki is traipsing about the countryside without even a single guard \u2014 and, worse, with a relatively untrusted stranger. It\u2019s Naoki\u2019s hope that Rudiger will stop being a stranger in the course of this trip, but even so, measures have been taken in regard to her security.One such measure passes by overhead, briefly eclipsing the sun in order to make them aware of its presence \u2014 a Dawn Rider: one of Isra\u2019s elite griffin cavalry. Glancing up, Naoki spots three riders circling overhead, but she knows there are more. In the event of trouble, they could be on the ground in moments \u2014 and there are few troubles can\u2019t be solved through the judicious application of Griffin.\u201cWhat do you think the odds are we\u2019ll be harassed?\u201d Naoki asks Rudiger. A casual question, making chat as they make their way across the field. ", "1562357599000": "\u201cHmmmh.\u201d Naoki assumed this area would be a lawless wasteland where, as a seemingly unarmed noblewoman accompanied by only a single strapping lad, groups of multiple strapping lads would think it a good idea to attempt to rob them. But the people of Vortua aren\u2019t nearly as accustomed to Dawn Riders as she is. Seeing so many at one time will likely cause something of a stir among both the populace and the hypothetical brigands alike. Rudiger is implying that they\u2019ll put two and two together and not try anything with griffins overhead, and that makes enough sense.\u201cPerhaps I\u2019m not giving them enough credit,\u201d she supposes. It certainly looks like a wasteland, though. The \u2018field\u2019 they\u2019re walking across used to be forest in the not-so-distant past, and nature hasn\u2019t quite healed the scar yet. The ground is muddy, littered with stumps, broken branches, weeds, and small holes perfect for breaking one\u2019s ankle.Naoki stops, steps up onto a tallish stump, and peers ahead, trying to see Voruta City in the distance. \u201cThey really have pushed the treeline back,\u201d she remarks, squinting. \u201cI thought it would be a pleasant little jaunt from the forest to the city, but\u2026\u201d Trying to estimate the distance, she concludes that it\u2019s \u2018rather far.\u2019\u201cI suppose that\u2019s why they did it,\u201d Naoki supposes, stepping down. \u201cSo that it wouldn\u2019t be a pleasant little jaunt.\u201dNaoki glances between the distance they\u2019ve come so far, how far they have to go, and Rudiger. \u201cIt\u2019s further than I would prefer to walk,\u201d she states, watching for his reaction. \u201cCan you handle another ride, or should I find a horse and circle back for you?\u201d", "1564110040000": "Jul 9, 2019 13:51:45 GMT -8 Rudiger Dornmauer said:Rudiger had to give the Empress a double take as he heard her comment, of course when she wasn't looking at him. Even the biggest of fools would not try anything when all about them the most prestigious and capable members of the Imperial forces could swoop down upon them and carry them straight to prison... or down the gullets of their steeds, depending on who one talked to. \"Most peasants and brigands aren't idiots Your Empress,\" he replied softly, \"knowing from experience they know practical matters quite well, if not necessarily higher ones. They know that beast that can eat half their flock as an after thought is not one to unduly provoke.\"He had also been surveying the area they had been walking through, and remembering times when he and his older brother... well, adopted brother to be accurate... had hunted through these woods, looking to bring back fresh meat to the table. He could almost imagine a place where he had fallen off his little palfrey and broken his wrist, but the fades of his memory disappeared as soon as it seemed tangible. \"All things must change in time.\"\"I would very much prefer riding on horse, and I would suggest the same for Your Empress. It would allow for a closer and more thorough studying of the situation, if a slower one,\" he answered. Perhaps he was being a bit presumptuous, but he remembered the flight over unknowable miles of land between here and the capital, all blending together. It didn't allow for a proper appreciation of the subject matter.\u00a0Mouth sliding over to one side of her face, The Empress gives Rudiger the side-eye. \u201cThat\u2019s not what I meant to imply \u2014 the Riders are very conspicuous here. Closer to the city, where they\u2019re common, they can shadow people without arousing suspicion, but not so out in the country.\u201dIt also isn\u2019t what she meant about the horses and griffins but she\u2019s not going to push the matter; it doesn\u2019t seem like such an unpleasant walk. So she starts off toward the town, careful in choosing her footing. The ground isn\u2019t quite level, and it\u2019s a bit muddy, but that\u2019s why she wore her boots.\u201cWhat\u2019s your attitude coming into this?\u201d she asks over her shoulder. \u201cAre you glad to be back, eager to survey your lands, nervous of what we\u2019ll find here?...\u201d", "1564120388000": "Jul 25, 2019 20:36:34 GMT -8 Rudiger Dornmauer said:Rudiger again gave Naoki a bit of a glare? People being used to the Dawn Riders in Voruta? He could see several issues with that statement, first and foremost being that the Dawn Riders very rarely ever ventured down to this neck of the woods, pun perhaps intended mentally, and when they did everyone was on high alert. Be it in the city or in the deep parts of the country.He was beginning to get an understanding of what the Vorutan ambassadors were constantly enumerating to him. Isran over lordship had its benefits to be sure, with access to selling goods in higher quantities to be sure and bringing in luxury products from the Empire. But that very much did not capture the whole tale. Along with the luxuries came such a wave of cheaper items that home and cottage industries had been snuffed out from existence. There were several cases of Isran companies coming in and replacing Vorutan workers with their own help, exacerbating the poverty issue. The raids were just the final in many straws that would break the strongest stallion's back.And perhaps the worst part of all of it, it seemed no one high enough in the Isran Bureaucracy cared. And Rudiger was beginning to suspect that as being more than the truth. No one he had approached in the government had given anything more than a glassy stare when he asked about certain conditions. He had been taught from a boy that the worst thing that someone could do was show complete apathy to your existence. Even if you disliked someone, you would still devote some energy that hate. But in apathy, you did not even offer that. Many in Voruta shared that same opinion.It was the forgotten province, and in that blind spot bred frustration and resentment. The common talking points around the table in ale houses and on the roads often sounded much the same. If any other province in the Empire experienced half the issues that Voruta faced, then there would be parchment reports back to fill whole buildings. But how many could point to Voruta on the map, even as they built their homes out of her lumber, ate Vorutan rye bread with iron dug up from Vorutan soil. Iron that if they controlled they could use against those blasted orcs. But damned pieces of parchment secured them to fat cats who in the same breath as sending in Isran strike breakers to crack skulls would call the Vorutans the savages.\u00a0Finally he answered, \"A mixture of all three Your Empress. I have not received much in the way of accurate reports in the capital, and I wish to be able to return when I am Duke with a full list of all that needs to be addressed. And I suppose... I suppose I wouldn't mind seeing my old home, to see my family. Even if we aren't blood related... they're still my family.\"\u201cMmmh, certainly,\u201d Naoki confirms, \u201cI\u2019d be pleased to meet them \u2014 if you\u2019d like. I wonder how they\u2019ll take the news.\u201d Naoki hums in amusement. A mother\u2019s reaction when her son returns home after twelve years, (in the company of The Empress,) to tell her he is to be Duke of the land. Though she\u2019d like to see the look on Rudiger\u2019s mother\u2019s face, Naoki resolves to exercise discretion when the time comes. She wouldn\u2019t like to intrude.They walk along for a bit before Naoki forms another thought: \u201cSeeing as how the whole \u2018incognito\u2019 bit doesn\u2019t seem like it\u2019s going to work out, we might consider changing our approach. Rather than trying to slink about and get a candid look at Vortuan life, what if we walked in just like this, hood down, and entertained conversations with the populace?\u201d A serious question, she\u2019s asking Rudiger how he\u2019d like to proceed.\u201cYou\u2019re going to usher in a new age, and if you were to begin as such, riding about to see what problems you\u2019ll need to solve, that might garner you some support. You\u2019re not going to be able to fix their problems today, but if the new duke comes, listens to your problem, makes a note of it, and then has it resolved not too long after, that particular individual will have every reason to support you and your reputation will start off on a good note.\u201d", "1564704041000": "Jul 31, 2019 18:44:14 GMT -8 Rudiger Dornmauer said:\"I'd sooner deny a bear a feast than to make the acquaintance between you and my mother,\" Rudiger retorted to Naoki, a rare joke from him considering how terrified he was of her position. Which was not a critique of the Empress of course, it was just that titles demanded all due respect. A lesson all Vorutan children were taught from childhood from the lowest peasant to the greatest lords. And Empress was a rather awesome title, deserving of more respect than a mortal could muster.Rudiger began to wonder how often he was going to cock his eyebrow at the Empress, but here he was doing it again. Well she did raise a fair point. The locals were sure going to be suspicious that such wanderers would be pestering them about their daily lives as griffons and their riders circled overhead. Probably not the most congenial to conversation.\u00a0\"A fair plan your Empress, and one I would be inclined to adopt. I would recommend that we stop by a lord's residence and put on more fine clothing then. Can't have the peasants thinking we are but vulgar folks on the putting on pretend.\"Naoki hums in mild amusement. \u201cThis is why it will be good for you to be in power,\u201d she comments. \u201cThe provisional governor probably isn\u2019t doing very much better than I am as far as Vortuan sensibilities are concerned. It seems like much of my Isran logic just doesn\u2019t apply.\u201dAfter a bit more walking, Naoki reaches a conclusion.\u201cI have two goals,\u201d she begins, brandishing two fingers. \u201cFirst, to see The Duchy. Considering I am ultimately responsible for it, I should know more about it than I do. It\u2019s part of my duty, and frankly, it\u2019s rather disrespectful that I don\u2019t \u2014 I\u2019d like to remedy that, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m here.\u201d\u201cIn addition to that, I\u2019d like to project the idea that you, the new Duke, are my Duke. There was a bumpy period in the middle there, but now that The Empress has restored a Mindaugas to the throne, the rightful Duke will bring Voruta back to its former glory. With the backing of The Empress and The Empire, he will restore order, bring great prosperity, solve the big issues, and so on and so forth.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what the narrative will be,\u201d Naoki informs Rudiger. \u201cIt will take years, perhaps generations to be fully realized, but that\u2019s what it will be, and it begins today.\u201d\u201cWith that in mind,\u201d she continues, turning to face Rudiger, \u201cI am going to stop making decisions, and you are going to direct this outing. We\u2019ll do it how you think it would best be done, whatever that entails. If you think it would be preferable to dismiss the Riders, that can be done. If you think I should ride about the countryside in some woman\u2019s moth-bitten ball gown, you\u2019ve got another thing coming.\u201dTurning away, Naoki breaks into a small fit of laughter. She cracks herself up, sometimes, but her composure quickly returns. \u201cOtherwise, though,\u201d She pantomimes the transfer of authority. \u201cYour show.\u201d", "1577019240000": "\u201cMmmmh,\u201d Empress Naoki murmurs in agreement and nods. Her amethyst earring, which has hitherto remained dormant, glows brightly for the space of a few seconds, then dims. \u201cIt is done,\u201d she says, \u201cA messenger will deliver it on horseback.\u201d Though Naoki\u2019s communication earring has fallen into disuse in recent times, it remains a superb convenience in times like these to avoid the cumbersome process of having to flag down a griffin or what-have-you.\u201cCustoms, then,\u201d she prompts, looking to Rudiger. Both ears are pointed forward; she\u2019s listening. ", "1577749838000": "Hands in her pockets, Empress Naoki follows Rudiger both literally and figuratively, nodding at points as she ingests the information. She was expecting something akin to an etiquette class, but he has much more in mind and she doesn\u2019t mind because listening is easy.Seeing as how Naoki has never had any particular reason to study Vortuan myth, virtually all of what Rudiger lays out is new information to her. It\u2019s all too clear how the Vortuan emphasis on \u201cthe order\u201d and hierarchy baked deep into the core beliefs is a tool used by those in power to remain in power. It\u2019s not a surprising realization by any stretch, and she supposes it\u2019s probably quite effective.When Rudiger mentions the disaffected nobles, her ears quirk again, spotting relevance.\u201cAnd what would that entail?\u201d she asks, ignorant of the implications. \u201cWhat defining characteristics of the mythical Vorutan Empire would these nobles see reinstated? Surely they don\u2019t wish to return to nomadism, so that means... what?\u201d", "1578103026000": "After Rudiger is finished speaking, Naoki is quiet for a few moments. Then she hums \u2014 as one does when they\u2019re informed of such things.\u201cLovely,\u201d she remarks. \u201cGlad  to hear they have come to resent me so quickly.\u201d The sarcasm is thick, but she refrains from making any additional snarky comments. Instead, Naoki nods, internalizing the information. It doesn\u2019t seem as though she\u2019s surprised or particularly bothered by the notion of civil unrest amongst Vortuans. Really, it would be unreasonable for her to expect them not to dissent when their land is in such a state.\u201cYou\u2019ll have quite a time building your public image,\u201d she supposes to Rudiger. \u201cOnce you\u2019ve established yourself, we\u2019ll probably end up arranging narratives wherein you \u2018negotiate\u2019 with me to lower taxes, slide borders around, or what-have-you.\u201d A wavy gesture implies that it doesn\u2019t matter overmuch to Naoki what those changes may end up being so long as they serve their purpose. \u201cContinue.\u201d", "1579915348000": "Naoki hums. Undead horsemen intervening in the eleventh hour is not an unreasonable thought to consider. It may have been such that there was a necromancer of moderate skill among the castle\u2019s last defenders, who was only willing to out themselves in that most dire moment. There certainly shouldn\u2019t be any shortage of horse bones buried in the dirt of Vortua. Treachery is easily swept under the rug, but a fanciful tale might be spun to appease those commoners who saw the skeletal steeds doing their gruesome work. There are more ridiculous legends. Rudiger ought to have some inkling of what modern magic is capable of from his time in Isra, but in the context of the moment, Naoki doesn\u2019t necessarily feel the need to connect those dots out loud.Instead, she merely nods. \u201cPerhaps. \u2026 The shrines, they\u2019re around here?\u201d", "1579929876000": "Naoki nods along and accepts the skin, sniffing it briefly to determine the contents before taking a modest swig and returning it.

Whose blood? For what purpose? To serve the Duke? To 'protect the land'?\u201d She exhibits a moderate amount of concern.

I am Madame Naoki, speaking on behalf of The Midnight Sun. I apologize for reaching out to you in this way, and interrupting whatever it is that you might be doing. I would have much rather made your acquaintance over a nice meal, perhaps, under more pleasant and personable circumstances. However, this intrusion of mine is not without adequate justification. A\u2026 situation has recently arisen regarding one of our mutual friends,  Mr. Maelik. He is, as I speak, locked in mortal combat with an individual- a girl, I believe her name is \u2018Zuu\u2019. And it\u2019s not going terribly well for him. He has already sustained a number of serious injuries, including the loss of his left eye. We\u2019re not certain that he\u2019s going to win the fight, and even if he does, he will be severely wounded.\u201d\u201cUsually, we would be able to take care of this sort of thing independently, and supply overwhelming reinforcements at the drop of a hat. However, the issue arises in that the fight is taking place in Gauldin, and our network hasn\u2019t yet fully permeated that nation. I have some agents enroute, but I don\u2019t believe they\u2019re capable of effectively combating Zuu, and none of them are trained in any manner of medical care.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not entirely sure as to the relationship between you two, and it may be presumptuous for me to assume that you care about this at all, but I thought that you might appreciate being made aware. If you would be willing to intervene, I can guide you to the location of the fight, and expedite your flight by way of a portal at The Black Tower, leading to the Black Tower branch in Gauldin.

Unfortunately, not near any significant landmarks. However, I\u2019m looking at a map, and the enchantment on this gem, while it is active, allows us to discern the location of the wearer.

However, the gem remains in its active state, providing another perspective on the scene. ", "1455770632000": "The great metal carriage rolls up into the Nokari Mountains, following the rough roads to its destination. The rhythmic clopping of eight iron hooves and the creaking mechanical sound of the massive wheels turning signify swift movement. Madame Naoki is seated in one of the frontal compartments with Artemis, Kate, and the fairy. Her right arm is wrapped about Kate\u2019s shoulders where she sits adjacent, and in the other hand a small, well worn, blue tome sits propped open between her thumb and forefinger: Dr. Brindley\u2019s Guide to The Wild and Whimsical world of Fairies. It chronicles the adventures of Dr. Richard P. Brindley, on his quest to encounter, observe, categorize, measure and record every type of fairy and fairy-like creature in the known world. As a firsthand source from an author of questionable sanity, its accuracy is debatable. However, the depth with which each specimen was observed and recorded is excellent, and the quality with which each species is documented and illustrated is\u2026 much. A lot of quality, I mean to say-  good book. In reading it, Naoki hopes to learn more about their new glowing friend by successfully determining what sort of fairy they are. Every so often, she\u2019ll hold the book up and compare one of the diagrams with a fairy , attempting to find a positive match. Atop the carriage, the roof hatch opens, and up peeks Jax, a man of middling age with a close-cropped auburn beard.  It\u2019s time for him to survey the surroundings, part of his duties as a carriage attendant. Stepping partially up the ladder such that the upper half of his body protrudes upwards, he takes a spyglass from his belt. Raising it to his eye, he pans around, checking the road ahead, the road behind, the great mountain faces rising up to either side of the road. If anyone would be following the carriage, watching it from above, if anyone moves to block their path, or otherwise to complicate their journey, it is his job to be aware.And- at least for the time being, everything seems fine. Hardly a well traveled road, the roadway ahead is rough, but empty of enemies, or indeed, any other traffic at all. A few examples of the local wildlife can be seen in the mountains around, a few goats here, a few birds there, but none that Jax categorizes as a threat. But then, far off in this distance, a low rumbling echoes through the mountains, reverberating between the peaks stretching up to either side of the roadway, and through the ground itself. Lowering the looking glass, Jax spins about, attempting to pinpoint the source of the noise, but finds it impossible to do so. The sound seems to emanate from all around, the left, the right, even the ground itself.  The shape of the mountains and the trees serve to diffuse and obfuscate the origin of the sound. A brief mental communication between the two carriage operators. Stan hears it too. At a whipping of the reigns, the rhythmic clopping of hooves increases in tempo, and the wheels turn faster. Pulling himself fully up out of the carriage and securing the hatch behind him, Jax moves across the roof to stand behind the mounted weapon. A quick check to ensure the advanced magical device is in proper working order, and the spyglass comes back out to sweep the terrain with heightened urgency. Within the carriage, the passengers would likely be insulated from the sound and the vibrations by the vehicle\u2019s armor and suspension, respectively. However, the carriage attendants, as ordered, immediately inform Madame Naoki and Artemis of the disturbance. Within the carriage, Naoki receives their message with no outward showing of distress. Eye contact and silent communication with Artemis, and a consensus is reached. Naoki sends a message to Lum'Valia  and Maelik The Fellblade , out in the main compartment. Pardon me, you two. It seems that there\u2019s some manner of disturbance outside. We\u2019re not sure what it is yet, but it seems to be something very large, pounding the ground and causing the mountains to tremble. If I might, I would like to suggest that one or both of you head out, and take advantage of your ability to fly to determine just what sort of beast or individual is out there, causing the ground to shake so. It might be something powerful and hostile, so please exercise all due caution, and keep us posted on what you see.Having informed the pair of them, Naoki continues just as she was, not meaning to alarm Kate or the pair in the adjacent cabin. (Those two are already probably already going at it anyway.) Once again, she compares a fairy to one of the diagrams in the book, and seems to have found a positive identification. \"This one seems to match reasonably well... What do you think?\"She speaks to the small room at large, attempting to solicit the opinion, if not of the fairy itself, of Kate, or Artemis.

A lot of time and high quality materials went into making it a veritable mobile fortress, something fit to tote the most precious of people around in. The protective runes on it were inscribed by Grandma herself, and loaded up with all sorts of immense runic power. But even they have limits. As the stone dragon says- shouts its bit about the hurricanes, the silencing runes give out.Immediately following its proclamation, there is a stunned silence in the carriage, as it vibrates with the residual echoes of the sound. Instinctively, Naoki moves to stand, to ready herself, to run, but realizes that doing so would be highly counterproductive. Strained, she remains seated, though her tail- wrapped as it is in the cramped confines of the cabin around Kate, begins to twitch nervously. She opens her mouth as if to speak, but is cut off by Jax before she can begin. His voice chimes loudly and clearly throughout the carriage. \u201cPardon me, passengers. This is your friendly carriage attendant speaking, and it seems that we\u2019ve encountered some turbulence on our journey, in the form of some manner of dragon. So if you\u2019d be so kind as to grab onto something, we\u2019re going to\u2026 make a tactical retreat.\u201dWithout any further warning, the carriage lurches into motion as it accelerates speeds one might not have thought possible for such a large vehicle. How the horses are able to pull the carriage at such a speed is anyone\u2019s guess. However, the rough mountain roads (if you can even call them that) are hardly designed for such expedient travel, being as made of dirt and bumpy as they are, and as a result, there is a great deal of lurching and jostling as the carriage careens down the road.Within the forward compartment, Madame Naoki opts to wrap one arm around the post of the small bunk bed, and the other around Kate\u2019s shoulders. She says nothing, but the intense glimmering of her earring would inform the astute observer that she is in the process of communicating telepathically. ", "1455852604000": "The twin dappled Percheron horses pulling the carriage continue to move in almost mechanical synchrony, hooves thundering across the ground as they pull the great carriage down the rough mountain roads. A stone boulder- almost as large as the carriage itself, is dislodged from the mountainside by the landing of the massive dragon, and lands in the roadway, blocking their path. However, the horses don\u2019t stop. They don\u2019t care! They simply lower their heads, and smash directly through the boulder, continuing on with incredible speed, pulling the carriage through the stone rubble. Within the carriage, Naoki relaxes slightly, but maintains her grip on both the pole and Kate. She speaks, just loudly enough to be heard over the clattering of the wheels and sounds of the battle outside.\u201cWe\u2019re outrunning the dragon, and help is coming. The Black Tower is sending their agents, and Lord Ildesias himself is on the way. We should be safe from here on out.\u201dShe heaves a great sigh, and tilts her head over to lean on Kate\u2019s shoulder. This is not the sort of cuddling she intended to engage in on the ride up, and not how the trip is supposed to be going. The whole situation calls to mind that particular, terrible night at The Sun when they were beset upon by that angelic fellow, and Hasdrubal \u2018died\u2019.  But this time, the angels are on her side, and it\u2019s a four kilometer dragon they\u2019re fighting. She decides, all things considered, that this situation is equally as terrible as, and overall, less enjoyable than that previous incident, and she would really rather these sorts of things stop happening altogether. However, after taking this moment of rest, respite, and lamentation, she launches back into it, closing her eyes and continuing to oversee and direct the battle efforts. Her earring shines more brightly than it ever has before, beginning to glow a bit, even. She informs Lum and Maelik of the inbound reinforcements, directs the reinforcements to the area (thought that isn't very hard, considering the size of the dragon), and in cooperation with Reese Cresno back at The Sun, keeps a map\u00a0 updated with the current locations of all involved parties. ", "1456018822000": "Despite Artemis' warnings, Madame Naoki insists on heading up to watch the final events of the battle unfold through the carriage's top hatch, leaving the forward compartment to ascend the small ladder in the primary area. Even as the carriage continues to rumble along the rough mountain roads, a pair of feline ears precede the rest of Naoki's head out the metal hatch. The blowing wind of the carriage's motion blows her hair forward, to whip around her face. To remedy this, she takes from her wrist a small bit of string, and ties her hair back in a quick and dirty bun. Raising a borrowed spyglass, Naoki gazes backward at the battle, framed as it is from her perspective between two peaks. She watches through the magnifying lens as Lum's spell reaches completion and is momentarily blinded by the bright flash of holy light. As her sight recovers, she catches a brief glimpse of the now-diminutive dragon feebly flapping away\u00a0 before it disappears behind a mountain. Hah. That's what you get for messing with my vacation. Idiot.Judging the battle to be complete, she orders the carriage be stopped, recalls her messengers, and calls off the rest of the inbound reinforcements. She sends a message to Maelik and Lum telepathically, \"Excellent work, it has been defeated. Were either of you injured? Should we come back to pick you up?\"As the strange green dragon begins to work its magic over the landscape, Naoki retreats back inside the carriage, and shutting and locking the hatch behind her with a slight grimace. Too many damn dragons, she thinks. Even if that green, earth looking one doesn't mean any harm, there isn't enough room to swing a dead cat without bumping into one of those things. Naoki holds no particular animosity for dragons as a species, and indeed, some of them are quite nice, but she internally laments how damn many of them there are, and how powerful they all are. If only they- and all the other celestial and godly beings- could just sod off, and leave her to her business, and not rip up her mountains, scatter magic everywhere without asking, or meddle in her affairs. ", "1456074319000": "From the carriage, Naoki watches in her mind's eye as the bright presence representing Lum'Valia fades and becomes unresponsive. Unconsciousness. Fortunately enough, the scrying functions of the ring aren't linked to the wearer's consent or consciousness, so Naoki is able to watch as Lum collapses, transforms, and falls to the ground. However, unfortunately, the ring Lum was given wasn't prepared to have the capability to project audible words, so Naoki cannot speak to the paladin- Ayra. She opts to have the ring glimmer and glow in a silent signaling attempt. Communication would become possible if Ayra reaches out to touch the ring. Instead, she reaches out to Maelik once more, and attempts to calm him from his battle rage. Maelik. The battle is over; we won, the creature is running scared. Don't bother chasing it, there's powerful residual magic still in effect around the thing- you'd get ripped to shreds. I'm having some of my agents track it, and we can return to finish it off another day. The more pressing matter at the moment is your well being, and that of Ms. Lum. She seems to have fallen unconscious, and physically changed following the casting of that spell. She seems unharmed as nearly as I can tell from here, but I imagine casting that took a lot out of her. We're coming back to pick you all up in the carriage. I would suggest- if you're able to move, that you either wait where you are, or make your way over to where Ms. Lum and the paladin are, and wait for us there. Good job. As stated, the carriage wheels around, and begins to trundle in the opposite direction, making its way across the shattered, get green landscape back to the area where Lum and Ayra sit. As they travel, Jax retakes his lookout position behind the mounted weapon on the roof of the mighty carriage. As Ildesias approaches on griffon-back, he is spotted, and the information is relayed inside, prompting Naoki to peek again out the top hatch, and wave to him. She attempts to indicate, through a small series of hand motions, that the battle is complete, they won, but her agents were incapacitated in the fight, and they are moving to exfiltrate them. Ildesias, not having been instructed on the nuances of Naoki's unique brand of sign language, probably won't 't pick up on all that, but she realizes this, and repeats the message in simplified, universal gestures. She points ahead to the area where Lum and Ayra are sitting, and motions to indicate that the carriage is going there. She suggests that Ildesias either land atop the carriage, or meet them over there. The carriage should easily be large enough to accommodate a regularly sized griffon landing atop it, and if he opts to, Naoki will order the carriage be momentarily stopped to facilitate the landing. ", "1456182212000": "With a great clattering of hooves and crunching of pebbles under wheels, the great iron carriage approaches and comes to a halt a short ways away from the assembled party.Leaping down from the top of the carriage, and likely followed by Artemis, comes Madame Naoki,  earring still glimmering furiously. She approaches the group,  and raises a hand in greeting. She is still wearing the well made and simplistic traveling outfit: gray sweater and black trousers. An appraising gaze sweeps the each of the combatants as she visually confirms and assesses their statuses. She notices Maelik's missing appendage, but tactfully decides not to mention it aloud. He's doubtless already aware of it, and mentioning it would just serve to trouble Lum. However, beyond Maelik's injury, everyone is apparently unharmed,  and that's cause enough for a cheery smile on Naoki's part.As she comes closer, she nods to everyone, gives Ayra a thumbs up, and addressees Lum, who is now apparently conscious, \"Excellent work. Jax is coming over with a stretcher, hang in there for a moment longer.\" Finished with that, she approaches Ildesias, and with a slight curtsy, begins to speak. \"Lord Ildesias. As you can see,  the battle between the dragon my messengers informed you and these heroes of mine is complete, and resulted in a victory for us. The dragon in question was reduced in size drastically,  and is as we speak flying...\"She pauses to obtain the information from her scouts.\"...away to the west, currently about ten kilometers from our position in that direction,\" she points, \"and moving about as quickly as a common bird. It seemed, while it was here, to be some manner of stone dragon, capable of absorbing the mountains to add to its own mass. Hence the extensive damage to the landscape; there used to be a mountain where we're standing, I believe. I have a pair of my agents trailing the beast as it flees, such that someone might be dispatched to finish the job. I managed to collect a great deal of information about it as it fought, and have a transcript of everything it said. As soon as I'm able, I'll prepare and have delivered to you a full written after-action report containing all of my collected knowledge of the beast and the events that transpired here.\"Here, finished with that primary point, she pauses, and takes a deep breath. Dust of pulverized rock is still in the air, tainting the otherwise fresh mountain air. She coughs a bit on the particulate matter, but recovers quickly and continues.\"I should also mention. In addition to the actions of my friends here, there was another individual who assisted us in battle against the titanic dragon. He was male... tall, with... it seemed like silver hair. He carried a massive spear, which must have been ten meters long at the very least. He moved with superhuman strength and speed, entering the battle from the sky, descending from above to deal a crushing blow to the dragon's midsection. We lost sight of him in the lightshow following the titan's defeat, but I imagine he's around here somewhere.\"She pauses again, gesturing around to the shattered landscape. An individual could be easily obscured behind any one of the innumerable boulders and debris that litter the ground.\"Also, the stone dragon seemed to know the fellow. It referred to him as... 'Syrossss,'\" she does a comical impression of the dragon- though she cannot quite replicate the immensely deep tone of voice that comes with having lungs the size of city blocks.\"Regardless, Syros' assistance was invaluable, I doubt the monster could have been defeated without his help. Personally, I hadn't heard of Syros before today, and I make a point of knowing about anyone that strong. His identity beyond that name, allegiance, and motivations for assisting us today are completely unknown to me. Also, seeing as how it seemed to recognize him, it is mt assumption that Syros might know more than we do about the origins of the titanic dragon, so it might be worth asking him about; if he can be located and engaged in discussion.\"At this point,  Jax approaches with a large stretcher under one arm,  and the carriage's medical kit in the other hand. He whispers to Arya, Maelik and Lum in introduction, greeting, and praise, and suggests that Ayra, if she's feeling up to it, help him get Lum onto the stretcher and into the carriage,  and that Maelik go ahead and bandage up that stump, so it doesn't bleed everywhere.Back over with Ildesias, Naoki remembers her manners. \"Oh! I'm sorry; please excuse me.  I failed to introduce you all, or explain any of the context as to why we're all bumming around in the boonies out here.\"With a great deal of waving and pointing, she begins introductions. \"Everyone,  this is Lord Ildesias Xen Torsal , of Isra. This is Mr. Maelik The Fellblade , formerly Demonlord of Wrath. This is Ms. Lum'Valia , a holy dragon of some note, and... Miss? Miss Ayra. Who I've not yet had the pleasure of meeting until just now. We'll have to shake later. I believe she functions as a paladin of some description,  but I'm afraid I don't know more than that.\"\"This is Jax, one of my carriage attendants, and back in the carriage, we should have Miss Green, Miss Skarlet, Mr. d'Artusio, young Lorelei,  Lucia,  and Klur,  as well as an as of yet unnamed fairy,  and Stan, my fine carriage driver, and all of them friends of mine.\"\"We were, with the exception of Ayra, who was already doing battle with the dragon when we arrived, driving up to a house I've had built up here in the mountains...\"  She turns, and gestures off in a direction behind her. \"...roughly thirty kilometers in that direction, with the intention to relax. However we were, as you can see, rather rudely interrupted by that titanic dragon. Once we are all finished here, I intend to continue our journey there, and would like to extend the invitation to both yourself and Ayra, if you'd care to come.\"Realizing that she's been talking for far too long than is probably polite, and that she should probably allow Ildesias to get a word in, Naoki stops here, and stands silently,  hands clasped behind her back.", "1456289924000": "\u201cI understand completely- it was hard enough for me to find this time, and your schedule is even more packed than my own. However, I thought it polite to offer. Perhaps you could drop by another time.\u201dAs Ildesias mounts his griffin, Naoki takes a moment to gaze around at the landscape. Indeed, there had been a mountain where they are standing. The ground underfoot is rough, untouched by erosion. Layers of rock are clearly visible in a sort of cross section brought about by the violent tearing of the dragon\u2019s appropriation of the mountain. Lying just a few meters away, an uprooted tree lies splintered on the ground. The powers that participated in that battle were likely among the most powerful in the world. She\u2019s surrounded by individuals that are capable of moving mountains and massive feats of magic. It\u2019s almost humbling. But then she remembers that they all fight with her, and the last idiot that tried to screw with them got obliterated by a holy laser. So it is humbling, in that she knows the extremely limited extent that she is capable of personally defending herself, but also inspires feelings of accomplishment, in having made such excellent and powerful allies, and pride, in that her friends did such an excellent job of removing the latest threat with such extreme force. Her musings are interrupted as Ildesias inquires as to if she has anything else to say. She looks up at him on his griffin, shielding her eyes from the sun as it rises behind him, making a dark silhouette of his form. \u201cI don\u2019t believe so. You can expect my full report to reach you by the end of today. Have a safe ride back, and I look forward to speaking with you at a greater length later.\u201dShe nods her head, mimicking his display of respect, and watches silently as he takes to the sky and departs, soon losing sight of him behind one of the remaining mountain peaks. She takes another moment to gaze around, and reflects on how incredibly fortunate it was that they happened across the titanic stone dragon before it reached any major settlements, how incredibly fortunate it was that she had opted to invite Maelik and Lum, and how Syros had decided to drop in and assist them all. She imagines what might have happened if the thing had reached Isra. It would have been dealt with- and a victory would have been reached all the same by the combined and concentrated forces of The Black Tower, The Conjunction, and Isra\u2019s military (including the specialised dragon slaying Seraph), but to think of how many would have died. It would have been the first national disaster of any significant magnitude, and it had been so narrowly avoided by her choice in house guests, the intervention of a stranger, and the scheduling nuances that placed their trip on this particular day. Perhaps the thing, when spotted by one of Reese\u2019s observational outposts around Isra, could have been dealt with in a similar manner away from the city without great loss of life. But still. Far too many fortunate coincidences for Naoki to feel safe. She resolves to order increased regional surveillance, and after doing so, returns to the carriage. Stepping up the ladder silently, she enters the primary compartment of the carriage to find Lum, Maelik and Arya all asleep. She smiles, again overcome with pride. All of that fighting must have been quite tiring. Maelik\u2019s leg is back, and not bleeding on the rug; good. The lot of them seem to be breathing, also good. Approaching the bench, she moves quietly to fasten the restraint belts around Lum and Arya, careful not to wake them. A simple hook into ring, they would both find the restraints simple to unfasten when they wake, and until then, the belts should keep them from falling off the bench as they sleep. She doesn\u2019t bother to belt Maelik in. He\u2019s tough. If he bumps his head, the worst that would happen is that he might get aggravated and use fire magic to roast the carriage from the inside. Realizing this, she moves as if to attempt to secure him, but stops when she realizes that he\u2019s three times her size, and altogether too large to make proper use of the restraining belts. How does he even fit in here? Maybe he could do that thing where large individuals assume human form again.That would be both convenient, and decidedly more cuddly, she muses. But until then, he\u2019ll have to deal with it. Trusting the twins and Klur not to do anything they\u2019ll regret, Madame Naoki excuses herself with silent steps to her cabin in the front of the carriage, where Kate and the fairy presumably still wait. As she shuts the door behind her, the great horses pull the carriage into motion once more.[Exit to Chalet Du Sommet Minuit with Kate Green, Artemis, a fairy, Skarlet, Francesco d'Artusio, Maelik The Fellblade, Lum'Valia, @klur, Lorelei & Lucia, and Arya Shieldheart]", "1453930050000": "Low in the Norkari Mountains, far from Nokari settlements and out of any private territory, a path diverges from the main road. Wide enough to fit a larger-than-normal carriage, it leads upwards through a natural tunnel of foliage. Eventually, high in the mountains, the road comes to an obstacle. Twin pillars of piled stones flank the road, with an immense log resting atop them. A wrought-iron gate fills the gap between the pillars. On this gate is affixed a sign, which reads, \u201cPrivate property, no trespassing! Danger: lethal defensive measures are in place. There will be no additional warnings.\u201dPassing through this gate, the road winds down into a small valley, and along the shore of a small lake. Nestled between two peaks and surrounded by evergreens, the vibrant aquamarine is placid and still, only a few light ripples disrupting the mirror-like surface. As the road continues on around a bend in the shoreline, a break in the trees provides a stunning view over the water.The natural beauty is not the only thing that draws the eye at this point, however. Across the water, near the end of the lake, a small assortment of buildings cluster around a single large, sprawling, chalet. Piled stone walls create a firm foundation for the log beams and thick boards that frame the chalet\u2019s many vertical windows and support the steep angles of the roof. A large covered balcony faces the lake, and other smaller porches and balconies can be seen on various parts of the house. Triangular windows peek out from under the gables. Smoke rises lazily from several of the chimneys that dot the rooflines. On one corner of the building, huge panes of glass form a floor-to-ceiling window that wraps around the corner. A particularly large chimney rises above this section of the house.Around the chalet, done in the same architectural style, are the outbuildings, which include a carriage house, a stable, several small cabins, a sauna and bathhouse building, and a greenhouse. Narrow flagstone paths run between the entryways of each building.Thick oak doors with wrought-iron trappings lead into the building at several points. Each of them has a small area to hang coats and take off snowy boots just inside the entry-way. The main entrance, an imposing set of double doors facing the forest, leads into an impressive hall. Rough-hewn logs buttress the vaulted ceiling, some three stories above. Polished cedar planks form the floor. Rustic tables along the walls display pottery and other various items. Two woolen blankets, adorned with colorful geometric patterns, hang from one of the walls. Wrought-iron chandeliers hang from the ceiling. On the left and right of the room, wide hallways lead into the other areas of the chalet. At the far end of the room from the door, a grand staircase leads up to the other two stories. Balconies frame the room at each level.A strip of rich, red, carpet runs down the center of the hallways leading off of the entry hall. Off of each hall, doors give access to bedrooms and bathrooms.The bedrooms are comfortably-sized spaces, floored in the same cedar as the main halls and well-provided with all the trappings and furniture one would expect in a bedroom, with a large plush rug cushioning the majority of the floor. Tasteful paintings adorn any walls otherwise undecorated, and a large window provides a remarkable view, no matter the room\u2019s location in the chalet. A small fireplace warms the room.The chalet is formed in three equal sections. The center wing runs parallel to the shoreline, and the left and right wings branch from it at 120-degree angles.In the middle of the hallways in the left and right wings is a small common space. Each of them is slightly different in feel and layout, but a table and chairs, a fireplace, a few armchairs, and a small shelf of cards, games, and books are common features. The second-story common rooms also each have a pool table.At the corner between the left and center wing, the top two stories are given over to one of the primary gathering spaces of the chalet: the main lounge. Floor-to-ceiling windows provide an incredible view of the lake and surrounding mountains. Leather couches and easy chairs dot the floor in several clusters around coffee tables. In the center of the room, a large, square, freestanding stone fireplace crackles invitingly. A well-stocked bar presides over the rear of the room, the counter formed from a slice down the middle of a stout tree, polished to a mirror finish. Hunting trophies adorn the walls. Fur rugs cushion the cedar planking of the floor. Wrought-iron chandeliers hang from the bare roof beams. Against each wall, a suit of plate armor stands silent guard. One of them grasps a halberd, the other holds a sword and shield out in front of him. Where the coat of arms might be were these relics possessed by a noble warrior, there is emblazoned a Midnight Sun logo.In the corner between the right and center wings is a cluster of large rooms. From centermost to rightmost, they are the kitchen, dining room, and ballroom. The kitchen is sizable and modern, and well-equipped to handle the culinary needs of the chalet, even at full capacity.The dining room is a sizable, vaguely trapezoidal room, in the same architectural style of the entry hall and lounge, with a two-story vaulted ceiling. A series of long rustic tables can be arranged to form whatever seating arrangement is desired. On the long wall of the dining room, a wall of windows provides a view of the lake, and several french doors allow access to a long covered porch. Various forms of outdoor seating and a few tables furnish the porch, and small fires burning in copper braziers take away the chill of the air.The ballroom is a square room with exquisite marble flooring. Rich red drapes frame a view of the surrounding peaks through several tall, narrow windows. A small stage in one corner suggests a place for musicians to play.On the third floor of the left wing, there is another set of unique rooms accessed from a single door. This door leads into Naoki\u2019s study. The wood panelling is slightly darker here than in the rest of the chalet. Windows along the far wall let natural light into the room. Under the windows and continuing around the left wall of the room runs a single desk, books littered sporadically on its surface. The proper home of those books is with many of their fellows on the set of bookshelves running part of the right wall, next to a set of organizer shelves and boxes. A circular stand-alone fireplace occupies the middle of the room, along with several exceptionally comfortable-looking armchairs, two circular tables, and dark red upholstered chairs to go with them. Luxurious carpet covers the floor. The whole atmosphere is cozy and inviting, the perfect place to curl up with a book and watch the snow fall outside.A door in the right wall, between the bookshelves and organizers, leads to Naoki\u2019s bedroom, which is dominated by a large four-poster bed that could easily fit four people. The single portal to the outside is a bay window, the shelf of which is large enough to sit in comfortably. The rich carpet from the study continues into this room. Paintings of various sizes adorn the walls, with the exception of one conspicuously bare spot. A small bookshelf, a table and two chairs, a wardrobe, a dresser, and a vanity complete the room\u2019s furnishings. A door in one wall leads to her bathroom, which includes a tub nearly large enough to swim in.On the first floor of the left and right wings are storage areas, containing linens, firewood, food, drink, and other necessities, in sufficient quantity to last comfortably through a long winter with no resupply. In the left wing, were one to open a particular door, they would find themselves in a short hallway terminating in a vault-like metal door.The greenhouse outbuilding is empty at the moment. Beds of dirt lie fallow and the gardening tools slumber neatly in their places. The building is equipped with magically-augmented heating systems to allow a year-round growing season, no matter the outside temperature.The bath house outbuilding contains several changing rooms, a shower area, cold, warm, and hot bath areas, and a sauna. The interior is done in finely-cut wood and blue slate, all prepared assiduously to resist the ravages of soap and water.", "1456341545000": "[Enter from The Norkari Mountains with Kate Green, Artemis, a fairy, Skarlet, Francesco d'Artusio, Maelik The Fellblade, Lum'Valia, @klur, Lorelei & Lucia, and Arya Shieldheart]At long last, the great iron carriage approaches The Chalet. The journey took considerably longer than was expected due to the interruption of Rag'Novok, and the sun is just beginning to set as the carriage comes to a halt in front of the gate. Madame Naoki enters the primary compartment with a silver bracelet in hand.Finding the lot of them still asleep, she places the bracelet in Ayra\u2019s hand, carefully as not to wake her. After checking to ensure that Klur is still wearing his necklace, she silently treads back to her forward compartment and shuts the door. Leaping down from his perch atop the carriage, Jax approaches the gate. As part of his training in utilizing magical devices and weaponry, Jax is one of the few who can open the gate's complex system of locks without getting fried. He spends a few minutes there, fiddling with the gate, before he successfully completes his task, and the gate swings open of its own accord. With a slight jostling of the reigns, Stan edges the carriage forward through the gate, and onto the premises. Those who are attuned to magic would almost certainly feel as they are brought into the area of effect of The Chalet\u2019s defensive auras and barriers. All sorts of terribly powerful magic effects and defenses overlap and and thrum with energy. But quietly, like a giant\u2019s breathing in repose. The barriers and defenses take no action on the carriage or its occupants, save for observing their approach, and there are no outward indications, for those who aren\u2019t attuned to magic, that anything is out there besides the snow and the trees. As the carriage winds its way up the driveway, the overwhelming presences fade as they move away from the perimeter barriers. Within the carriage, Naoki sits upright on her knees to peer out one of the portholes. They\u2019re almost there. She allows a portion of her excitement to shine through, bouncing slightly and holding her tail straight upright. As the carriage rounds a bend, The Chalet and lake come into view through Naoki\u2019s window. She nearly squeals. There it is! Right there! Her house! Look at how big and impressive it looks! They\u2019re almost there! She considers calming herself, but decides not to. Artemis and Kate won\u2019t mind her small indulgence. Probably. There it is! The actualization of one of her longest-standing dreams, sitting there by the lake. Her own home, her own castle- without any drunkards, rowdy bar-goers, or flesh abominations in the basement! \u2026 Well, any rude flesh abominations in the basement. Her castle in the sky, now built here, atop this hill, just a few short moments away! A quick message to Stan- the horses trot faster. Breaking away from the window, Naoki turns to consider her fellows in the forward compartment. Kate, Artemis, and that friendly fairy fellow: the best of companions with which to share the house with. Naoki is beaming at this point, welling with feelings of anticipation, satisfaction, and achievement. A few minutes later, the carriage comes to a stop again, this time directly in front of The Chalet\u2019s main entrance. Rising from her perch on the bed, Naoki gently grasps Kate\u2019s hand in her own, and tugs toward the door. Her voice is still charged with emotion, \u201cShall we?\u201d ", "1456401119000": "With all of the passengers disembarked, the carriage trundles away, continuing on toward the carriage house and stables. Remaining mindful of those who still slumber, Naoki speaks softly. \u201cThey\u2019ll bring our luggage in later.\u201dA gust of mountain air sweeps through, bringing with it the biting winter air; Naoki is reminded of the imperfect aspect of The Chalet\u2019s location. Through chattering teeth, she stammers, \u201cL- Let\u2019s get inside.\u201dWithout any further musing or admiration of the building, Naoki leads the way inside, pushing one of the tall wooden doors inward to allow entry to the vestibule. After seeing everyone inside, she allows the door to shut again, closing out the chilly arctic air, and allowing the heating to take full effect. She takes a deep breath outward, and spends a moment reveling in the warmth. However, with a speed of excitement, she quickly moves to the inner door, and pushes it inward to allow the group entry into the primary entry hall. Rough-hewn logs buttress the vaulted ceiling, some three stories above. Polished cedar planks form the floor. Rustic tables along the walls display pottery and other various items. Two woolen blankets, adorned with colorful geometric patterns, hang from one of the walls. Wrought-iron chandeliers hang from the ceiling. On the left and right of the room, wide hallways lead into the other areas of the chalet. At the far end of the room from the door, a grand staircase leads up to the other two stories. Balconies frame the room at each level.She stops there in the doorway for a moment, overcome with the magnificence of the hall. It\u2019s a brand new level of \u2018holy wow this is my house\u2019. Conveniently enough, the door clicks into the open position with some manner of clever latch, leaving Naoki to peruse the hall. She stumbles in awkward circles, spinning around in an attempt to digest all of the sights to be seen, gaze darting around the room, resting for only a moment on each feature, mouth slightly agape. Rugs and books and sofas and art and chandeliers and it\u2019s so warm! Glancing back toward the vestibule, she remembers Maelik\u2019s heavily laden state. She should probably do something about that first. After taking a moment to orient herself, she gestures in the direction of one of the wide hallways, and beckons for the group to follow her. She sends a mental message to those members of the group that are currently conscious. \u201cMost of the bedrooms are down here, in this wing. Every bedroom is marked with a golden doorknob, and if there\u2019s not a name on the door, it\u2019s unoccupied. Feel free to select any unoccupied bedroom as your own, spend as much time perusing as you\u2019d like. Maelik, I\u2019d suggest that one there for your group there- at least temporarily. It has enough beds, though you personally might not find the taste in decorum to be to your preference.\u201dTrusting the others to find their way to someplace comfortable, Naoki again takes Kate, as well as Artemis by the hand, and attempts to lead them both down to the end of the hall of bedrooms, where a single door sits separated, slightly wider, and made of another sort of wood compared to the rest. Three silver plaques sit side by side, each engraved with a name, the very same names as those three who now stand before the closed entryway. Naoki raises a hand as if to reach for the knob, but finds it as she left it, grasping Kate\u2019s hand. Her smile grows still wider, and she nods in the direction of the door. \u201cAfter you.\u201d", "1456755700000": "As they step over the threshold and through the small vestibule, Naoki stops. Her gaze roams the room, resting for a moment on each feature before moving to the next. As her visual examination proceeds, her smile -which has been a constant feature since they\u2019ve entered the building- widens. Here it is. The physical actualization of one of her most prominent dreams. Just sort of, sitting here. Waiting to be lived in. There\u2019s the painting of the sun rising over the ocean. There\u2019s the tree, with the mural of the night sky. Looking up, Naoki is able to identify constellations and formations of stars in the ceiling, a depiction of the same stars she spent so many hours gazing up towards; one of the only constants during her earlier years. It\u2019s almost too much, to see it there, perfectly constructed and accurate to each and every detail. She silently sings praise to that damn Aeedanian addict architect, Ruben, remarking momentarily as to how well individuals can do, when properly motivated. As Artemis opens the door to the bedroom, Naoki can see past- a glimpse of the large bed. The whole thing doesn\u2019t even fit into the limited field of view through the door. A single tear makes its way down her face, eventually dripping down off the point of her chin. It\u2019s too much. To be here now, with Artemis and Kate, in the home of her dreams, with nothing planned. She had thought she was happy before, and indeed, she was. But this kind of goes beyond happiness. Naoki searches for words, for a word, but comes up blank. There are no words or phrases in her vocabulary to adequately express these feelings. So instead, she opts to reciprocate the embrace, heaving slight sobs of joy and dampening the shoulder of Artemis\u2019 suit. After the hug breaks, Naoki thinks it best to seat herself. Taking a few short steps over to one of the room\u2019s couches, she places her behind squarely in the center, resting her elbows on her knees and her face in her hands, still crying tears of joy. ", "1456977748000": "Naoki sits and sobs for a moment longer, leaning into Kate\u2019s embrace. When she regains her composure, she pulls back, and returns Kate\u2019s gaze. \u201cYou\u2019re entirely correct, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m so happy. It is okay. Everything is fine. Everything is perfect! There is nothing wrong; there are no problems, shortages, issues, troubles, or threats, of any sort.\u201d\u201cI believe Artemis told you, once before, that we met in a brothel. What she didn\u2019t tell you at the time was that when we escaped, we burned it down. We burned the entire damn thing to ashes, and we ran. We left the city and roamed together, village to village, town to town. We did what we could to get by; we stole things and tricked people. We stuck around in some places more than others, and on some occasions had a roof to sleep under, but nowhere to call home. One of our favorite topics to discuss, as we were sitting under the stars for the hundredth time over, was what our house was going to look like. How it would have a big tree to read in, how it would have a four poster bed with red curtains, how it would have lots of fireplaces and nice paintings.\u201dAs she mentions the furnishings of her castle in the sky, she gestures toward the corresponding features in the suite around them. \u201cAnd now\u2026 Here it all is. This room, this house, is the actualization of nine years worth of dreams. This is the first true home I have ever had. The office and such above The Sun were nice, sure, but that was little more than a comfortable workspace. Here, this\u2026 This isn\u2019t an office above a bar. This isn\u2019t a pile of leaves under a tree. This isn\u2019t a cushion caked with the spunk of fifty men. This isn\u2019t the cobblestones of an alley, the damp bricks of a prison, or the loft of a barn.\u201d\u201cThis is mine. This is mine, and this is yours, and this is ours. The home I\u2019ve always dreamed of, good food, money enough to buy anything I need, and I have the two of you to share it all with. I don\u2019t know what more there is to desire.\u201d Noting Artemis\u2019 hand on her leg, and the look in Kate\u2019s eyes, Naoki figures that this would be a good point to relocate to the bed. Gently pulling free, she stands, and inclines her head in the direction of the open door leading into the bedroom. \u201cSpeaking of desire\u2026\u201d she trails off, a teasing smile creeping onto her face. ", "1457111086000": "Naoki follows Kate into the bedroom, removing her sweater and tossing the garment aside to fall where it may.As the rest of her outer garments join the sweater somewhere on the floor, Naoki suppresses the start of a long, verbose internal monologue about how wonderful her situation is, choosing instead to focus on the heady mixture of emotions she feels at the moment, and the very appealing task at hand. There will be time enough for talk and deep thought later.Now clad only in a matching set of lacy black undergarments, Naoki finally pulls the ribbon from around her neck, twirling it around her fingers as she slinks towards the bed. Hm. With a comically raised contemplative eyebrow and a wandering gaze, she mentally consults her arsenal of knots, considering how to best make use of the ribbon. She opts to go for the simple, effective solution. Sitting on the bed behind Kate and gently stopping any attempt to turn around, Naoki wraps the ribbon around Kate\u2019s head, covering her eyes, and ties it in place with a few well-practiced twists of her fingers. A basic technique, but an immensely effective one, and one of her personal favorites. When a subject\u2019s sight is removed, their other senses become heightened to compensate, making them more sensitive and responsive to touching, and introducing a sense of anticipation.The blindfold in place, Naoki pulls Kate down into the soft cushion of the bed, before lying on top of her, gently pinning her down with her body weight. Pulling the silvery-pink hair aside, she begins to trail kisses down the side of Kate\u2019s neck. ", "1457308402000": "Kate collapses, spent; a satisfied smile curves its way across Naoki\u2019s face as she observes her handiwork. Finished with her task, she moves up to lie to Kate\u2019s left, sliding her right arm around the other woman\u2019s shoulders.\u201cHas anyone ever told you that you moan in the cutest way?\u201dIn an attempt to elicit just one more of those moans, Naoki\u2019s unoccupied hand palms one of Kate\u2019s breasts, squeezing lightly for a few seconds. With a chuckle, she then moves the hand up to caress Kate\u2019s face, fingers gently tracing the curve of her jawline. \u201cLet me ask you this question, Kate, in both the immediate and far reaching sense. What would you like to do? That is to say, how would you like to spend the next hour, and how would you like to spend the rest of tonight, and the rest of our time here?\u201d", "1457373966000": "At Kate\u2019s mention of not being able to stay, and the following \u2018nevermind\u2019, Naoki curves an eyebrow of mild confusion. Naoki had already addressed this issue back at The Sun, and there\u2019s something Kate doesn\u2019t feel she should share. Knowing not to press the issue, Naoki instead decides to press lightly into Kate herself, scooting into a slightly closer and more comfortable snuggling position. \u201cKeep in mind, the beautiful thing about all of this is that by this time tomorrow, the transportation conduit will be complete and fully operational. We\u2019ll be able to use it to pop back and forth between here and Isra as much as we\u2019d like. We both have obligations back in the city, and I\u2019m not suggesting that we ignore them all to cuddle here forever just yet. You\u2019ll be able to spend the day at your shop, I\u2019ll be able to work at the Citadel, and we can spend every night together, right here, without any of the hassle involved with a carriage ride\u2026 The wonders of modern magic, applied in ways that matter to me.\u201dNaoki accomplishes a significant feat, by tearing her eyes off her partners for a moment to observe the room\u2019s large bay window. Through it, the warm tones of the setting sun are no longer visible, having given way to the muted grays of a cloudy night. \u201cGetting dressed and all that, though\u2026 can probably wait for tomorrow. There\u2019s no need to rush, and as fun as all of that sounds, none of it seems quite as appealing to me right now as simply\u2026 remaining as we are.\u201d To elaborate on that last point, Naoki leans over and plants a kiss on whatever potion of Kate is convenient. ", "1457458993000": "Naoki\u2019s eyes remain closed as Kate crawls on top of her, but her hands betray her wakefulness, rising to meet each other behind the small of her lover\u2019s back. At Kate\u2019s suggestion, a slight smirk works its way across Naoki\u2019s face. She responds in a mockingly aristocratic tone,  \u201cMy goodness, Kate. That would be exceptionally unladylike.\u201dNaoki opens her eyes and looks up at Kate, a devilish smirk on her lips. She could get used to waking up like this. \u201cI like the way you think.\u201d Lazily rolling her head to the right, Naoki looks over at Artemis. \u201cDid you catch that, Artemis? Kate wants to try The Double-Stuffed Duchess\u2019 Tortellini. Could you fetch us batch of noodles from the kitchen? \u201d", "1457541306000": "As Skarlet knocks on the outer door of the suite, Naoki isn't visibly surprised. A component of the door\u2019s security had alerted her to an approaching presence through her earring, so she had been expecting someone to knock, even if it was just Artemis returning quickly. However, as Kate dismounts and covers herself, Naoki turns her lower lip upward in a pout, and considers the door of the bedroom with an eye of irritability. What could be so important at this time of the morning, to warrant ruining that perfect moment? It probably wasn\u2019t intentional on Skarlet\u2019s part- whatever it is is probably pretty important, but still.Propping herself up in bed, Naoki takes just a moment to send a message to Skarlet, making it clear that she would need to wait for a moment, before facing Kate and beginning to clarify.\u201cI can explain, that\u2019s Skarlet, out there. A few weeks ago, on one of my trips to The Citadel, I brought Skarlet to get her citizenship paperwork done; she wasn\u2019t a legal citizen until that day. Apparently, vampire age doesn\u2019t take into account the age of the individual before they became a vampire, and, as it turns out, Skarlet is technically just over one year old, having only become a vampire about this time last year.\u201d\u201cAnd, as I learned, it seems that persons under the age of eight cannot file for independent citizenry in Isra without a parent or guardian. So I adopted Skarlet, became her legal guardian, and completed her citizenship paperwork under that understanding. Doing so was faster and easier than getting an independent approval for her unique case, and it means that she\u2019s tax-deductible now, so that\u2019s nice.\u201d\u201cTo further clarify, Skarlet isn\u2019t my biological child- none of those exist, and I haven\u2019t asked her to call me \u2018Mother\u2019; she\u2019s doing that herself. To be honest, the familiarity still seems a bit strange to me, especially seeing as how even though she may only be a single year old, her intelligence and body far outpace her age, and she\u2019s essentially as tall as I am\u2026 But\u2026 I think she finds it comforting, and considers me a maternal figure beyond the legal guardian status. I don\u2019t mind it much, and I empathise, it\u2019s a strange and terrible feeling- not to have all of your memories. If she\u2019d like to lean on me as she establishes herself and her identity, that\u2019s fine, and I\u2019m happy to do what I can for her. At least I don\u2019t have to change her diaper, you know?\u201dFinished with her thought, Naoki raises her arms up above her head and stretches, pulling on one with the other. As she does so, she looks around and sighs, still very pleased with the state of affairs. \u201cAnyway. I had planned to tell you all that and introduce the two of you sometime today. I had my mouth full last night, I think you\u2019ll remember.\u201dNaoki launches Kate another smirk, slowly running her tongue across her lips in lewd clarification. She lingers on the bed, waiting to see what Kate has to say before getting up to get the door.", "1457568530000": "\u201cHey now, she likes the bunny outfit! I presented it as an option, and she hasn\u2019t said a peep about it. I bet Francesco likes it too. I don\u2019t think anyone can argue that she doesn\u2019t wear it well.\u201dAs Kate dives beneath the covers, Naoki raises an inquisitive eyebrow. But as the series of lumps in the sheets make their way down to the foot of the bed, and then back up in the direction of her feet, Kate\u2019s intentions become clear. Naoki lets fly a short sigh and shakes her head, still smiling. There\u2019s no way. Skarlet\u2019s a vampire; her senses are massively enhanced. As fingers begin to pry at her adjacent feet, Naoki sighs again and adjusts herself into a position to better facilitate the deception, spreading her legs and sliding up to lean back onto the headboard. There\u2019s still the matter of the door, though. The outer door of the suite is locked eighteen times over. For as capable as Skarlet is, the door wasn\u2019t designed to be possible to force open. However, there is a solution. One that doesn\u2019t involve getting up. Though the telepathic capabilities granted to her by the earring, Naoki reaches out to make contact with the rudimentary consciousness of the door. By imbuing the door\u2019s internals with some of the same magical constructs one might use to animate a golem, Reese had managed to give the door a manner of consciousness. Consciousness enough, at least, to accept commands and act on them. Though this is the first occasion she is attempting to interface with an artificial consciousness, Naoki manages to will the door open. Over the course of a half minute, the locks disengage one by one, and the thick door creaks slightly as it swings inward, admitting Skarlet to the common room. With the heavy door out of the way, Naoki calls out to Skarlet, \u201cCome on in, and shut the door behind you.\u201dFiguring it a reasonable idea to at least start the conversation with some semblance of decency, Naoki pulls the blanket up over her chest and holds it in place under her armpits. She takes a deep breath, likely the only one she\u2019ll have for the duration of the conversation, and mentally prepares for this trial.", "1457593732000": "As Skarlet enters the bedroom, Naoki raises an arm in greeting, before swiftly returning it to her side. She does her very best to maintain a straight face and not betray Kate\u2019s presence, and does an admirable job of it, considering. It\u2019s difficult not to crack under this (excessively gentle) sort of pressure. \u201cHello, Skarlet. Uhm. Clearly\u2026 not! I\u2019m doing brilliantly, and would be happy to assist you with whatever problem it is you find yourself faced with.\u201dHere, Naoki\u2019s demeanor falters, as she rapidly flicks her ear for a few seconds, trembling momentarily. \u201cHowever, if you\u2019d prefer to come back laaater- when I\u2019m properly dressed, that would also be ohhhkay. I\u2019ll let you know when things are f-finished here.\u201dFinding a brief lull, Naoki offers Skarlet an apologetic shrug and smile. This wasn\u2019t exactly her idea. ", "1457626709000": "\u201c\u2026 Really.\u201d Madame Naoki is evidently caught off-guard by Skarlet\u2019s inquiry. She wasn\u2019t really sure what to expect, but\u2026 something more mundane, surely. Goodness. Instead of taking the time to think about why Skarlet is asking that sort of question, she decides just to answer it, and come back to the 'why' later. Placing a hand on her lap in an attempt to dissuade Kate for a moment, she begins to speak in a very flat and even tone. \u201cWell, the excellent thing about a lot of books is that a loooot of them have an index, or table of contents. What have you got there, is that\u2026? Yes. That large blue book you\u2019ve got there, that\u2019s a good one. One of a kind, be careful with it, but if you open it up to the very end, it should have a listing of which topics are discussed on which pages. So you\u2019d want to find something that says \u2018female reproductive organs or systems\u2019, or \u2018the reproduction process\u2019, or something like that, take note of the numbers listed next to those topics, and turn to the pages in the book that correspond to those numbers. I can\u2019t really- ohh. Can\u2019t\u2026 get up right now, but after I\u2019ve finished here, I\u2019ll be happy to come show you and explain and discuss that whole\u2026 deal. If you\u2019d like, you could go wait in the study. Great place to read.\u201dRaising a trembling hand, Naoki gestures behind Skarlet to the door of the study. ", "1457664226000": "As Skarlet leaves the room and the door shuts behind her, Naoki breathes a sigh of relief that ends up developing into something altogether more intense. She leans back into the pillows and grips the sheets tightly, her back arching slightly for several seconds before she relaxes. \u201cYou\u2019re a pretty quick study, aren\u2019t you?\u201dWith a sweeping arm movement, she tosses the blanket back and inclines her head forward to look down toward the end of the bed. ", "1457742040000": "Naoki opens her mouth to respond, but is cut off as Kate abruptly changes the subject. For a moment, she pauses, with so many words on the tip of her tongue. So many things to say, so many feelings tumbling about inside her, waiting to be given voice. She sighs, and adjusts to lean more comfortably into Kate. There will be other times, she supposes. Best to pace things a bit. Naoki resigns herself to the change in topic and responds simply, \u201cArtemis is probably watching the pot.\u201dThoroughly unmotivated, Naoki remains as she is. Skarlet is waiting, yes, but the bed is warm, and Kate is comfortable. In Naoki\u2019s prioritization, the force compelling her to go inquire as to why on earth Skarlet is suddenly interested in the medical processes behind reproduction are not higher than the combined forces of the magnetic bed and the immovable object of Kate\u2019s head on her shoulder. ", "1457914682000": "But\u2026 Naoki supposes that Skarlet isn\u2019t just going to go away, and it wouldn\u2019t do to have her around when Artemis gets back with the pasta. Logically thinking, it would be a good idea to go deal with her now, so they can really enjoy themselves with the Duchess\u2019 Tortellini later. That would mean extricating herself from the current situation, though. This incredibly warm and comfortable situation, partially covered by the bedsheets, with Kate\u2019s head on her shoulder, sharing body heat, simply being close. To be completely honest with herself, Naoki would like nothing more than to remain exactly like this. But again, Skarlet isn\u2019t just going to go away. Speaking gently, Naoki does her best not to ruin the moment while ruining the moment, \u201cI should really go help Skarlet with her issue. I\u2019ll be right back; keep my spot warm.\u201d Carefully, Naoki extricates herself from Kate\u2019s embrace and from the bedsheets, scooting across to the edge of the bed. But there\u2019s an issue. The clothes haven\u2019t arrived yet; all of the wardrobes are empty. She considers using the garments that litter the floor from yesterday, but those are all\u2026 wrinkled. Wrinkled and sweaty. Naoki doesn't consider herself too much of a neat-freak, but she\u2019d like to avoid putting on dirty clothes, if it can be helped. She sits on the edge of the bed for a moment, and considers. The suitcases are still either out in the carriage, or somewhere in transit. She could call for someone to bring them up immediately, but it\u2019d be awkward opening the door again and having one of the attendants hand her the suitcase around the door. But wait - a thought strikes her! There should be robes in the bathroom. Standing from the bed, walks over to the door of the bathroom and proceeds inside. After taking a moment to locate and open the linen closet, she spots a fluffy white bathrobe, and pulls it out Sliding it on, one arm at a time, Naoki finds the robe to be exactly as warm as it looked, if not more. She suspects that some manner of magical effect is in play, either to pre-heat the robe within the closet, or perhaps to bestow an additional warming effect to the wearer. Regardless, Naoki finds the robe to be a truly excellent piece of clothing, and after tightening the belt to achieve a reasonable level of modesty, Naoki gives Kate one parting smile before slipping out the door and shutting it behind her. From the common room, Naoki takes a few steps over to the door of the study, and enters. She raises a hand in greeting to Skarlet, and moves up to stand over her shoulder at the desk. \u201cSo how are you faring? And, if you don\u2019t mind my asking, what\u2019s with the sudden interest in this subject?\u201d ", "1457925562000": "Naoki raises an eyebrow of incredulous disbelief at Skarlet\u2019s explanation. She responds empassionatley, waving her hands around to put emphasis to her words. \u201cFrancesco needs to tone it down a notch! You two haven\u2019t even been together for a full year, and I haven\u2019t heard anything about marriage. Children usually come after that, if at all! I don\u2019t have any issue with the two of you fooling about however you see fit, but before he knocks you up- if such a thing is even possible, I\u2019d like to get to know the guy a bit more, and see some expression of his dedication. Having children is no trivial matter. Doing so makes you and your partner directly responsible for the creation, development, care and management of an entire human being. That\u2019s a massive responsibility! I know that I haven\u2019t had too much time to spend with you, but you\u2019re clever. I don\u2019t need to change your diaper, dress you, or any of those things that are typically associated with raising a traditional child. Taking care of an infant, raising one from the ground up- that requires an immense amount of dedication and investment, both of time and resources in the traditional sense. Before you start considering having Francesco\u2019s baby, as romantic as the notion might seem, you need to put some serious thought into the concept of having a baby. It would be your baby. Have you seen someone with an infant child? Do you know what all that entails?\u201d", "1457931166000": "From her position behind the chair, Naoki extends an arm to pat Skarlet\u2019s shoulder. \u201cThere you, go that\u2019s the right attitude. I\u2019m not angry, but I want to do everything in my power to stop you from making a decision without enough information to properly identify and understand the ramifications of your actions. Remember, you have all the time in the world. Always take things as slowly as you need to; take all the time necessary to do things correctly the first time. It\u2019s better to do things slowly and properly, and have no regrets, than to make lots of poorly deliberated mistakes that you will regret later. To help with that, it\u2019s always good to do research before you embark on any large undertaking, you can\u2019t make an informed decision without information. I\u2019ll always be happy to share my accumulated knowledge with you.\u201dReaching over Skarlet\u2019s shoulder to reach the book on the desk, Naoki flips around some, attempting to locate a particular page. \u201cSo, judging from the noises you two make, I think I can skip the portions related to sexual intercourse; you seem to have a handle on that. That\u2019s the first step in the human reproductive process, the intercourse. You should note here, that all of these things I\u2019m about to say, they only apply to the traditional, human method of reproduction. The process is very similar with some other animals and races of humanoid individuals, but this information is only fully applicable to humans, as they do their business regularly.  Additionally, there are other ways of going about reproduction. Ways that utilize magic, work between different species, don\u2019t require a second individual. There exist lots of wacky and wonky non-traditional methods of reproduction and creating sentient beings that I\u2019m not going to cover- just be aware of that.\u201dAt this point, Naoki has located the page she was looking for. It contains a really excellent diagram of the human female genitalia, labeled neatly with small numbers that correspond to medical terms in a key on the right. \u201cAnyway, this book you\u2019ve chosen, this is a really excellent book. It contains essentially the sum of all modern knowledge as it pertains to medicine. Very thorough, very up to date, this is a brilliant source. This here, this is a diagram of the female genitalia. You figure, the man enters like this\u2026\u201dNaoki uses her finger to overlay the diagram with a crude representation of the male genitalia. \u201cAnd he does his business, and expels that sticky white stuff right into here, this area. As it turns out, surprisingly enough, the sticky white stuff actually has a purpose, beyond just being there to provide natural lubrication. A properly functioning set of female genitalia will take that substance, known medically as \u2018sperm\u2019, and pull it into here, around through here, and use it to fertilize the egg.\u201dAs Naoki continues to explain the process, she gestures around the diagram and to the corresponding terms in the key to illustrate.\u201cYou see, eggs aren\u2019t limited to birds and such. Humans use eggs too, but they keep them within the body. The sperm heads up here, and usually just fertilizes a single egg. If it does more than one and nothing untoward happens, that\u2019s when you start to get twins and triplets and such. Over the course of a short while, the fertilized egg is moved from here, to over here, and then up into the womb. In the womb, a lot of rather complicated processes take place to change and grow the egg into an infant, which is then birthed. Then you\u2019ve got a newborn baby.\u201dShe thinks back over her explanation, and thinks if there\u2019s anything to add. \u201cThat\u2019s an extremely simplified explanation, but it\u2019s accurate to the best of my knowledge. To be honest, I haven\u2019t read extensively into the subject myself, and am not sure exactly how all of the processes work. I\u2019ve obviously never been pregnant myself, and also can\u2019t speak personally to that experience, however, I know that it\u2019s an extremely taxing and stressful process. If you have any further questions, we\u2019re pretty much going to have to refer to the book together.\u201d", "1457937277000": "\u201cI hear a lot of things.\u201dNaoki smirks, and waggles her ears before returning to a neutral expression. \u201cI don\u2019t mind, though. I can\u2019t reasonably expect you to do your business out of my earshot. Make sure to take good care of the book and put it back where you found it when you\u2019re done, and I\u2019ll speak with Francesco soon enough, whenever we both have some spare time. At some point, I\u2019ll have to introduce you to Kate, as well. She\u2019s really quite nice\u2026\u201dNaoki trails off. Really? \u2018Nice\u2019? That\u2019s it?! Those are all the words you have? Pitiful. Absolutely pitiful. \u201c... Yeah. Maybe over a meal, or something, I\u2019m not sure. In the meantime, have a read at this, and understand what there is to know about the process of reproduction. I\u2019m hardly an expert on vampiric body manipulation, so I can\u2019t help you much personally in that regard, but if you have any more questions you\u2019d like answered, I will always do my best to help you or direct you to the appropriate resource.\u201dIn the common room outside, the noise of Artemis with the cart signals a very well timed ending the conversation. \u201cIn the meantime, though, let me ask you in the most polite and loving way to scoot on out of here. Artemis is back with our breakfast, and I can tell you right now, we\u2019re not going to be adhering to any sort of table manners.\u201dAnother smirk, along with a funny, intentionally awkward sort of wink carries a lot of implications that Skarlet ought to be able to pick up on.", "1457938599000": "Madame Naoki turns, slightly puzzled, to watch Skarlet leave. Interesting that she\u2019d choose to go for the ear-scritch, over the light hug or perhaps the handshake. Strange, but not disagreeable.\u00a0 Dismissing the matter, Naoki follows Skarlet from the room, and meets Artemis in in the common room, where she notices the fully stocked cart. Filled with Tortellini, no doubt. An awful lot of it, though. That\u2019s\u2026 one, two three\u2026 eight covered trays. Taking a pair of quick sniffs, Naoki utilizes her (apparently pointy) nose to attempt to discern the contents of the extra trays. The most prominent scent is bacon. Good-smelling bacon, too. Artemis had the forethought to prepare a proper breakfast, as well as the Tortellini required for the Duchess. Naoki nods to Artemis, adding small signals to indicate satisfaction and affirmation, and inclining her head in the direction of the bedroom door, with connotations of suggestion. ", "1458079058000": "After seeing Skarlet out and the door safely shut behind her, Naoki re-enters the bedroom, and seats herself cross-legged on the bed, allowing the robe to flop carelessly around her figure and the belt to loosen. She accepts the plate from Artemis, and holds it carefully. However, despite her best efforts, in the transfer, a dollop of syrup escapes, falling down to add to the stickiness of the sheets. Madame Naoki looks down at it for a moment, disappointed, before dismissing it. The bedlinens would have to be changed later regardless; one more blob of syrup is a drop in the metaphorical bucket. Spearing a pancake with her fork, Naoki tears off a portion that could theoretically be fit into her mouth. Disregarding standard table manners, (do you see a table?) she jams the portion into her mouth, and chews contemplatively. Artemis was right, it\u2019s not quite Maelik\u2019s cooking, but it\u2019s good enough. She proceeds to continue consuming the contents of the plate rather hurriedly, occasionally shooting glances over to her dining companions, thinking ahead.However, Kate outpaces her, finishing her plate and getting up, moving as if to put clothes on. That won't\u2019 do. Naoki raises a hand in protest, and holds the other over her mouth to speak. \u201cOi! Brefffest isn\u2019t ovah-\u201d She swallows, \u201cDon\u2019t you go start getting dressed!\u201dShe places the last strip of bacon into the side of her mouth, letting it hang as she rises from the bed, places her empty plate back on the serving cart, and exchanges it for the bowl. She takes a moment to examine the bowl of pasta, experimentally squeezing one between two fingers. Finding them to to suitable, she sidles over to Kate, and presents the bowl in two outstretched hands. The pasta within sits quietly, steaming slightly. \u201cWe\u2019ve still got the Duchess\u2019 D.S. Tortellini.\u201d[Fade out. Seriously, this time.]", "1458461108000": "\u201cSure, sure\u2026\u201dFrom her position face-down on the bed, Naoki waves a hand about lazily, indicating acknowledgement of... whatever it is that Kate just said. After Kate leaves the room, Naoki remains still for a long while. Laying, thinking, basking, considering; appreciating the wonders of pasta and the warm bed for a while longer. However, after some indeterminate amount of time, she figures it would probably be for the best to get up and be functional. Moving to an upright position, she scoots once again across the bed, creating a Naoki-sized path through what must be at least a remaining ten servings of pasta. Standing rather unsteadily, she waddles across to the bathroom, and starts a warm bath. Picking a half-tortellini from her hair, she lobs it toward the wastebin. She misses. Exhaling sharply, she decides that she doesn\u2019t care, and leaves it be. Over the course of the next two hours, assuming that she isn\u2019t interrupted, Naoki will proceed to clean herself, starting with a warm bath, the sheets, exchanging them for new ones from the closet, and the room, dutifully picking up the discarded clothing of yesterday and heaving them into the laundry bin. If she reaches the end of her cleaning cycle, Naoki will opt to take a break before attending to the matter of dressing for the day, collapsing facedown onto the bed. Even though it\u2019s only just before noon, Naoki had given the Duchess her all, and is still thoroughly exhausted from such an aerobic activity. ", "1458903626000": "The sound that comes from within the bedroom in response to Kate\u2019s query of readiness is low and muffled, almost as if Naoki is yelling into a pillow. Which is, in fact, quite the case. \u201cNoooooooo\u2026\u2026\u201dHowever, she shortly finds it in herself to get up and get dressed. Though the door, Kate may hear muffled mumblings, the rustling of clothing, the opening and shutting of drawers, or the sharp expletive as she bumps her toe on one of the dressers. Soon enough, however, the door swings open, and there she stands in the doorway.Evidently, Naoki hadn\u2019t put nearly as much thought into her choice of attire, simply covered in nothing more than a loosely fitting white blouse and a bottom that is short in both name and in practice. Since she has just been through the bath, her hair is still damp, hanging lower, with less volume,  and looking darker, more shiny than is standard. Though she\u2019s still a bit sore by the combination of the recent completion of The Duchess,and the altercation with the dresser, no traces of irritation are present as she looks Kate up and down.\u201cI can\u2019t help but feel underdressed\u2026\u201d She trails off. Probably the first time she\u2019s ever uttered those words in that particular sequence. It doesn\u2019t seem to be much of a problem though, seeing as how she surges forward and around, circling Kate a few times to properly appease her attire, reaching out in a few places to adjust the fit of her ensemble, tossing in a few (perhaps inappropriate) pinches and tail-ticklings for good measure. She completes her spiral by leaning in close to give Kate a peck on the cheek, before stepping back to lean in the doorway. She takes another long look, and sighs a bit. An appreciative sigh, a yearning sigh; a content sigh. \u201cI don\u2019t have words to adequately describe how\u2026 how good you look to me. I don\u2019t think I ever will- not without using superlatives\u2026\u201dShe trails off, lost in the moment, before remembering why Kate is standing there so expectantly, and snapping back to an upright position.\u201cYou\u2019re right, though, the guests! ... If you\u2019d like to call them that. We should probably go see how they\u2019re doing, you're right. Lead the way.\u201d", "1459172954000": "Following Artemis\u2019 communication, Naoki can\u2019t help but smile. The image brought to her mind inspires other images- possible futures of tonight. Though Arya\u2019s armor, especially the leggings, doesn\u2019t leave much to the imagination to begin with, Naoki\u2019s mind is easily able to envision all sorts of positions and sounds. After Kate\u2019s back is turned, Naoki turns to Artemis, shuts one eye, and gives a thumbs-up instead of responding mentally. As they traverse the halls, Naoki\u2019s attention is split evenly between the slightly bouncing folds of pink fabric before her, and the house around them. Overcome again with wonder, she can\u2019t help but avert her eyes to take in some of the sights. Though the interior of the suite had been planned to the last detail, the rest of the expansive establishment was left almost entirely to the discretion of that drugged up architect, and is unknown to Naoki beyond the floor plan. On the way to their destination, the group passes a large spiral staircase, presumably leading to the upper floors. In addition to the masterful marblework in the floor, a large, red gemstone, perhaps the size of a volleyball, can be seen swinging back and forth in the area between the stairs, held up by a cable stretching up to the ceiling. Noaki diverges from the group for a moment to investigate, approaching the staircase to get a better look. Glancing first upward, Naoki confirms that the cable is attached to the ceiling, or more accurately, the center of a large, domed skylight. The gem itself does indeed seem to be exactly that, and Naoki recognizes its motion as that of a pendulum. A three story Foucault pendulum, where the bob is a ruby the size of her head. What even\u2026 The sheer absurdity of the thing brings a smile to Madame Naoki\u2019s face as she turns her back on the staircase to rejoin the group. How unnecessary. How lavish. What a strange thing to have in one\u2019s home. How many people, Naoki wonders, can truthfully claim to own a pendulum of any sort? Not many, that\u2019s for sure. Regardless, she maintains her position behind Kate for the duration of their walk, not wasting any more of the ogling opportunity. When they arrive at the room where Lum and Maelik had slept, Naoki casts an eye and an ear around in an attempt to locate the pair. Though the blankets are rumpled and the room shows signs of having been lived, the individuals themselves simply don\u2019t seem to be around. She voices this assertion of the obvious, \u201cThey don\u2019t seem to be here. Perhaps they left to explore the house, or have something to eat.\u201d As trivial a matter as it would be to simply check for their location, Naoki opts not to. A search around the house might be an enjoyable way to explore some, and perhaps get sidetracked in some incredible way. ", "1459506621000": "\u201cOh, if you insist.\u201dThough she stretches the last word, it\u2019s evident that Naoki has no issue with leading an expedition of the house. Though she has a rudimentary understanding of the layout and looked over some of the material invoices, the full extent of the chalet\u2019s accommodations are largely a mystery still. Since Kate has already taken her by the arm, Naoki wastes no time in leading the way from the relatively dull confines of the bedroom, out into the hallways. As they walk, Naoki thinks back to what Kate had mentioned being interested in seeing the previous evening. The pool, the greenhouse, and then a meal. Hm. The pool probably wouldn\u2019t be the best first stop, because to use it, they would have to disrobe and go through the processes of drying and such to move forward. That could come later, Naoki thinks. For now, she steers in the direction of the greenhouse, toward the rear of the center wing. Along their path through the halls, the group passes by a great many closed doors and alternate paths. Like a great sprawling maze, the chalet presents its expanses of comfort and coziness at every turn. As tempting as it is to simply bounce around, wandering without any real aim from one interesting fixture to the next, Naoki refrains. There would be time for a thorough, methodical exploration later; her current objective is simply to have an excellent time with Kate. Consulting her understanding of the floor plan, Naoki notices a shortcut they could take. She leads the group up to a tall set of finely decorated double doors, and begins to push one open with her unoccupied hand. \u201cLet\u2019s cut across the ballroom\u2026\u201d Naoki\u2019s words lose their driving force as the ballroom comes into full view. Six silver chandeliers hang at regular intervals from the ceiling three stories above. However, they are unlit, instead allowing light to filter in through the tall windows along the left wall, and the cloudy glass skylight, lighting the room naturally. Across from the windows, as well as directly across from the door our party is looking through, identical sets of ornate wooden doors sit closed. It isn't difficult to envision a band of musicians playing a waltz, and the ballroom filled with fabulously dressed couples, dancing away in the dead of night. Even now, visions of what could be accomplished in this setting, especially so in regards to Kate, and especially so in regards to dancing, begin to dominate the forefront of Naoki's mind.She stops on the threshold- one arm still holding the door open, as of yet unwilling to take a first step onto the polished stone floor. Momentarily squeezing Kate\u2019s arm in her own, she speaks in a whisper,\u00a0\u201cGoodness.\u201d", "1460166208000": "Naoki nods at Artemis\u2019 suggestion, but leaves her eyes where they are for the moment.\u201cYou\u2019re right, we definitely do need to make use of this, but I think I might prefer a more\u2026 sedate atmosphere. Maybe we could fit a miniature orchestra in here\u2026\u201d Stepping properly into the ballroom, Naoki shifts her gaze back to the room at large, considering how best to partition it for a high class party. Naoki\u2019s path through life has indeed crossed through a few ball-like events, but never as a guest or a host. To her, the room speaks only of immense opportunity. She could throw her own ball! What should the occasion be? Does there need to be an occasion? Heck no! Who needs those? Not Naoki, she has her own ballroom! Hah!\u2026 But it would probably add some legitimacy to the event if the purpose was to celebrate an important occasion, she supposes. To justify days off, and such. Thinking ahead, there aren\u2019t too many party-worthy events in the upcoming spring. Hm.\u201cWe\u2019ve got to do something with this\u2026\u201d Aha! An idea blossoms. \u201cSay, Kate. Unrelated inquiry: when is your birthday?\u201d", "1460397147000": "\u201cWell\u2026 I didn\u2019t know. There are still a good handful of things you and I don\u2019t know about each other, and I thought it prudent to ask, and now enjoy knowing. Maybe we\u2019ll do something for it, I\u2019m not sure\u2026\u201dNaoki raises her arms and shoulders in a shrug that is very clearly not genuine, if the massive smirk is anything to go by. However, the mischievous expression is only displayed briefly, before her face returns to resting.\u201cAnyway. We can dance later, when we\u2019ve got shoes for it.\u201dIf one were to lower their gaze to Naoki\u2019s own footwear, they would be able to see that her ankle strap sandals are about as appropriate for dancing with as Kate\u2019s high heels. However, they are quite suited to trading across the floor of the ballroom quietly, as Naoki approaches Kate and offers her arm. \u201cLet\u2019s continue through to the greenhouse, shall we?\u201d", "1460603709000": "\u201cWell, as it turns out, I haven\u2019t the slightest idea when, where, or how I was born.\u201dNaoki\u2019s answer is stated without any ostentation or particular emotion. Though she had been expecting the question, that didn\u2019t necessarily mean that the facts had changed. She remains silent for a few paces before elaborating, \u201cI\u2019m pretty strange. Most people, as I\u2019ve been lead to understand, have their first memories as hazy sorts of half-remembered events of their early childhood, when they are perhaps three or four years of age. My first recollections, which I remember with an apparently unusual clarity, were a few months older than ten years ago today. Which is strange, because if you were to look at me, or evaluate my actions, and attempt to guess at my age, I certainly don\u2019t seem to be ten.\u201dA suggestive waggle of her fingers emphasizes the anachronistic nature of her behavior. \u201cFurthermore, my first memories are not hazy or half-remembered, they are very clear. I can tell you exactly what I did and what I saw, for every second of every day for the first week or so that I recall. And at the time, my body was comparable with the developmental stage one might usually call a teenager. In comparing the youngest form of myself I can remember to others, I would estimate that I was perhaps fourteen or fifteen, assuming that I age in a way that is\u2026 congruent with your standard human. I was smaller than I am today, and have grown since then, yet I have recollection of my life before that point. If I even was alive before that point, I don\u2019t know. Additionally, to further clarify, I have never, to my memory, had what what could be called a traditional family. None have approached me and made a claim to be my relation nor have I come across any who are\u2026 like myself.\u201dShe trails off, and taps Kate on the behind with her tail, to indicate exactly what she means by her last statement. ", "1460971850000": "As it just so happens, a short way down the hall, a wide bench is clearly visible. However, Naoki makes no indication of moving further toward it. She simply stands, stock still in the hallway, facing ahead. Her throat bobs slightly as she swallows, before she turns to consider Kate with eyes that burn with that very same devotion. \u201cHold on a moment\u2026 This\u2026 This is one of the reasons I love you, right here. I\u2019m not quite sure how the causation, correlation, or any of that really work\u2026 I suppose love doesn\u2019t quite work logically like that, but\u2026 I trust you completely. I\u2019ve just recognized this. You\u2019re the first person I\u2019ve told this, and I didn\u2019t even think about that as I was telling you. This information, which I have not related to a single soul before now, I told you without so much as a moment\u2019s hesitation. I mean, Artemis knows, but that\u2019s because she was there for it all, she doesn\u2019t count in this context. I realize, there are exactly two individuals whom I trust absolutely, and they\u2019re both in this hallway. This is how at ease I feel with you. I don\u2019t have to filter my thoughts or control my expression, or anything! I\u2026 I\u2026 I cannot verbally articulate how this makes me feel. Let me\u2026\u201dIn a sudden rush of movement, Naoki surges forward to envelop Kate in a tight hug, wordlessly holding her close for a few moments before reluctantly separating. Still holding Kate by the shoulders, Naoki speaks again, \u201cThere is nothing that I would like more than to share with you the rest of my life story, other than perhaps hearing you do the same. Let\u2019s sit, though.\u201dNaoki proceeds to lead them to the obvious bench up ahead, and seats herself on the left side. If Kate would allow it, Naoki would attempt to wrap her arm around the other woman\u2019s shoulders, still yearning for some of that closeness.On the wall opposite, a tasteful bit of art hangs. It has little to no impact on Naoki or her feelings, yet there it hangs, sitting prominently in the field of view of any who would look directly across the hall while on the bench.\u201cBefore I start, let me say this. The only reason I haven\u2019t told you any of this sooner was because the thought never crossed my mind. I have only ever once told anyone what I just old you, and that was only in the last few minutes. I\u2019m not at all in the habit of divulging my past- at all, nor do I ever intend to be. Just now, I did it without thinking. Because I don\u2019t need to think when I\u2019m with you. It\u2019s so\u2026 I just\u2026\u201d Again, Naoki struggles for words, attempting to identify and articulate her thoughts. Eventually, after establishing eye contact, she settles on,  \u201cI\u2019ve never felt closer to you than in this moment.\u201d ", "1461180098000": "Allowing her gaze to drift across the art, Naoki simply sits for a moment, enjoying the closeness, thinking about what Kate said, and formulating her thoughts. After a long pause and a deep sigh, Naoki begins to speak. \u201cAlright. I\u2019ll look forward to that. Bear with me here, I haven\u2019t articulated any of this before.\u201d\u201cKeeping in mind what I mentioned a few minutes ago, the first memories that I can recall occurred just slightly over ten years ago. If I recall correctly, once I had figured out what dates were, I placed my first memories in early May or late April. Regardless, to the best of my knowledge, there haven\u2019t been any sort of disruptions since then. I feel as if I remember all events from then until now, without any gaps or obvious tampering.\u201d\u201cWith that said, I suppose that day is the only starting point I have. On that very first day of my memory, I remember, I remembered nothing. Thinking back on it, it was the strangest sensation\u2026 I was considering the world for what was, either literally or effectively, the very first time. It was an alley. Between two buildings, an alleyway, nothing particularly special about it. Both ends opened into streets. There were a few broken pieces of wood on one side, a couple rats, one of the buildings had a locked door on one side, and there were a number of other details that I could list, but really aren\u2019t very relevant, save for the fact that they were all completely new at the time. I bumbled around for a while, poking things to see what they were. Looking back on it, I did an awfully lot of things that seem very naive and foolish in hindsight.\u201d\u201cI suppose that\u2019s why it\u2019s hindsight, and it\u2019s called naivety, though. Logically, everyone must have done those sorts of things at the beginning of their lives. Regardless, and again like I mentioned just before, I was hardly an infant at that point. Far from it, I suppose I was about\u2026 one hundred and sixty centimeters tall? Probably something around there; I obviously wasn\u2019t measuring at the time. At that point, I had full motor control, was capable of complex chains of thought, and by all accounts, probably should have been alive for fifteen years or so before then, to be as physically developed as I was at the time.\u201d\u201cHowever\u2026 those first few hours I had, which I spent so foolishly, poking at rocks. Those were the only free hours I had for a long while. Shortly after wandering out into the street, I was\u2026 I was accosted, is what I was. I was accosted by some men who turned out to be working for The Casalesi, a local brothel. After determining that I had no understanding about how anything worked, they wasted no time in chaining me up as one of their girls. Though, I suppose they wouldn\u2019t have really cared if I did. They certainly didn\u2019t care when they stole the other girls. I wasn\u2019t the first to be simply taken off the street, nor was I the last. You see, the city, the mayor of the city, he was a patron. I\u2019ll come back to him, there\u2019s more to say, but let it suffice for now, The Casalesi was free to do as it pleased, as far as he and the city guard were concerned.\u201d\u201cHowever, I still had no idea what was going on at that point. Absolutely no idea. I wasn\u2019t angry with the men for taking me, because I didn\u2019t know any better. When I was told to suck something, I did, because, hey, why not. It was something new. They gave me some food after that. \u2026 I just realized. I had someone\u2019s genitals in my mouth before I had food. That\u2019s pretty\u2026 pretty terrible, thinking back on it like that.\u201d\u201cAnyway. Shortly after being taken into the brothel, they put an earring on me. Not this one, it was really more of a tag than a decorative or fashion accessory. A little scrap of metal, with what I realized later to be a number \u201829\u2019. That was how they referred to me, I was Twenty Nine. Some of the other girls, the ones who had names and families before that, called each other by those names, but without one, I was just Twenty Nine.\u201d\u201cOver the next few months, I did pick up a number of basic skills, alongside my considerable- even at that point, sexual aptitude. Language, speech, social skills. The sorts of things children learn in their formative years. I learned very quickly, though. Still do. I achieved a fairly functional social skillet after only a handful of months observing others, making sense of, and mimicking their behavior. I\u2019ve come to the understanding that my mind, my ability to remember things, in particular, is quite acute. I can recall for you all sorts of entirely inconsequential details about things, simply item I was aware of at the time. The number of steps up onto the stage, seven. The patterns of cracks on the walls, what sorts of things each man liked most. Generally speaking, if I fix my attention on something, I can later recall all that I noticed about it at the time. I understand that this isn\u2019t quite normal. Most people tend to forget little things, minute details that aren\u2019t worth remembering. I don\u2019t, though. I can\u2019t quite say why, I would seem to simply work that way.\u201d\u201cTo be honest, I really can\u2019t imagine how it must be to unwillingly forget things. To wake up one day, and not quite remember everything you did the day before. To not remember memorable occasions, or slowly forget important details about people or things you\u2019ve done. I mean, you all certainly seem to get on well enough without the full extent of your memories, but I simply can\u2019t understand it.\u201d\u201cI suppose it\u2019s something of a mixed blessing, though. On the one hand, it\u2019s immensely useful, or at least seems that way to me.  Everything about the way I operate is based on knowing all of the things I do. I attribute my relatively rapid learning to it, for one thing. My collection of available data to think back on and analyse is simply larger than most others. It\u2019s also quite nice to be able to recall details with ease. For example, our first meeting. You were wearing a brown coat with a hood, over a woolen blouse. You were a bit frightened at first, but I was burning some relaxation incense at the time, and you were very affected by it. I remember each and every word you\u2019ve said to me, every time we\u2019ve touched, and all of the things we\u2019ve done together. You and I, we\u2019ve already created a considerable number of memories to cherish, and I can recall each one as if it happened only moments ago.\u201dThe hand on Kate's shoulder squeezes briefly, and Naoki takes a few moments, presumably in reminiscence before continuing.\u00a0\u201cHowever, they're indiscriminatory, my memories. Indiscriminatory, and complete. I can\u2019t forget things, even if I\u2019d care to. I remember the face of each and every individual I was forced to pleasure. The things they said, the actions they took, every time I was beaten, all of it. I spend an awful lot of time thinking about my past. Easily too much time. For as much as I have preached moving forward, not dwelling on the past, and living in the present, I can\u2019t help but remember. In my own mind, it\u2019s almost as if I\u2019m looking at two things at once. What\u2019s happening around me, and something from my past. Often, I\u2019ll see something I\u2019ve seen before, an object or an action, and it\u2019ll call to mind some sequence of events from years ago, with all of the detail I remember. I have more control over this than I did, but I still can\u2019t fully prevent it. I\u2019ve become fairly proficient at moving past this, functioning fully in the present, but I still can\u2019t help but almost continually remember the past. Considering that the majority of my memories are far from pleasant, it\u2019s not quite ideal.\u201dThere\u2019s another long pause as Naoki considers her thoughts on the topic further, considering hypotheticals and formulating a complete opinion. \u201cTake the good with the bad, I suppose, but sometimes, I suppose\u2026 I just consider it plainly for what it is, a mixed blessing. To be completely honest, I wouldn\u2019t be here today if it wasn\u2019t for this uniqueness of my mind. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do all that I have, wouldn\u2019t be living as comfortably as I am, or be sitting here with you now. I realize that is an immensely empowering trait to have, and as I consider it now, sitting here with you, I don\u2019t think I particularly mind. I would pay a far greater price for you; some traumatic memories aren\u2019t really that bad, as far as things go.\u201d", "1461279029000": "\u201cYou are not responsible for any of that nightmare, never think you are. No part of it was pleasant, and you\u2019re not going to hear me say otherwise. However, in a strange sort of roundabout way, I am thankful for it. It was horrible, yes, and I would never wish it on any sentient being, but it gave me an unparalleled motivation, a motivation that eventually led to my current situation: surrounded by unimaginable wealth, both material and human. My past did propel me, is propelling me, and you are a part of the dream that has kept me pressing forward through many hard times.\u201d \u201cBut I digress. I\u2019ll spare you the fine details of brothel life from here on out. Suffice it to say, I learned to recognize it for what it was soon enough. A miserable and pitiful state of existence, where I was little more than another cute set of holes. At some point, someone said, \u201cYou can sell a sword or a loaf of bread once, but you can sell a girl a million times.\u201d That\u2019s when the resentment started to breed. I saw so many others whose state of living was so vastly superior to my own. I was as far down on the totem pole as one can get. I wasn\u2019t even a prostitute; I wasn\u2019t paid, or compensated for my efforts in any way. I was simply kept alive and functional. There were no opportunities to earn my freedom, or even higher status as a slave. It wasn\u2019t any sort of meritocracy, no matter how well I did, how much I improved, or how much I was able to accomplish, all I ever earned were extra rations, more blankets, and less beatings.\u201d\u201cPerhaps some of it was envy. I sat on these men, with their round stomachs and clean faces. I removed their fine silken pants, and lit their cigars. I wanted to live as they did: easily and luxuriously. But I could not. The opportunity simply wasn\u2019t available to me. If everyone at the brothel had their way, I would continue to hump wealthy men until I couldn\u2019t any more, or became undesirable, at which point I would be cast out into the street, likely to be killed or starve to death. I had seen it happen on numerous occasions. The girls, all very concerned with their appearance. When a couple wrinkles or a nasty scar means almost certain death, you tend to get very concerned about those sorts of things. Getting old, getting saggy, loosening up, these were all concerns in the forefronts of our minds. \u201c\u201c... I may have lost track of where I was headed with that. Oh, yes, resentment. I grew to hate life. I learned to hate my oppressors, the place where I was kept, the men I was forced to serve, the food I was given, all of it. This resentment grew and intensified with each day, and on multiple occasions, I considered taking my own life. I had seen that happen, too. Not every girl was able to cope with the brothel life. None enjoyed it, but after a while, some simply\u2026 broke. One morning\u2026 One morning I woke up, and my cellmate had hung herself in the night by her blanket. I\u2019ll always remember the way she was slowly spinning\u2026 It seemed as if her dull, glazed eyes were staring at me. She was removed promptly by a guard, dragged by the hair like a sack of meat. I don\u2019t know what they did with her, but I have no reason to suspect a respectful burial or cremation.\u201d \u201cAnd sometimes I would think. I would think, \u201cGee. What an unequivocally awful life I\u2019ve been dropped into. Sure do wish it would hurry up and be over, already.\u201d A few knots tied in the dark of night, and it would all be over. I would no longer have to deal with any of it. There would be freedom in death. Maybe there was an afterlife out there somewhere that would take pity on me. Maybe reincarnation was a thing that happened, and I\u2019d have a better experience the next time around.\u201dNaoki shrugs, some of the indifference filling her life at that point in time bleeding through into the present. . \u201cI obviously never went through with it, but I\u2019ll not falsely say I\u2019ve never considered the notion seriously. I like to think what motivated me not to was envy, and greed. Envy for those who led a better life than I did, and wanting to live that way myself. I wanted to live comfortably, eating the food I wanted, sleeping with who I chose  and nobody else. Somewhere, in words and concepts I had never yet heard, I knew I wanted  to spend my life with someone I genuinely loved.\u201dThe hand on Kate\u2019s shoulder squeezes again, and amber orbs flick past Kate to Artemis for a moment.\u201cAnyway, to that end, I came to understand that I needed to improve myself to reach such a position. I was aware enough to realize that I was unaware of many things, and I was intelligent enough to know  that to improve my position, I first needed to improve myself. To bend the world to my will, I first had to understand it.\u201d\u201cOpportunity came in the form of a portly man. At the time, I knew him only as Mr. P. His profession was that of a stationer. He created and sold books. One one occasion, Mr. P left one of his books behind. I was able to steal it, and spent that night reading it. It was a book about religion, and didn\u2019t really give me any useful or applicable information, besides a bit of context for the things some of the men would shout. When next I was made to see Mr. P, I returned the book, and managed to\u2026 to bribe and coerce him into leaving me another book to read. This arrangement carried on for quite a while, and I was able to absorb quite a substantial sum of information from his books. I read of love and war, politics and religion, anything that he would give me. My understanding of the world deepened immensely through the lense of literature,  and though I never quite looked forward to seeing Mr. P, what with his warts, I came to appreciate the service he was doing for me.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s where my passion for books comes from. Through books, I obtained my initial understanding of the world, and have ever since then, I have found them to be an excellent medium through which to grow intellectually. With this newfound information, I began to be able to formulate plans. Strategies. Escape plans. In coming to understand my situation more fully, I was able to identify ways in which the seemingly invincible and omnipotent guards were imperfect, just as human as anyone else, and prone to the same mistakes and vices as any human. I often considered attempting to escape. I was confident that I could get beyond the walls of The Casalesi, but I knew, from that point, I would be little better off than I was, and debatably worse. For as much as I had come to hate my situation and resent the ones who had put me in it and kept me there, they were the same individuals to whom I owed my continued existence to. If food were not provided to me, I would have no way to procure it. If I ran away, I would have nowhere to live, nowhere to be. If I were to leave, I would stop having that level of support, I would stop being someone\u2019s responsibility to keep alive. I knew that I wasn\u2019t capable of self-sufficiency at that point. Not at all, and not to mention the incredibly high chance of my being captured, either by someone who would return me to Casalesi, or one who would force themselves on me, without the need to pay first, maybe even kill me afterwards. No, it wasn\u2019t a viable option yet. Not in my state at that point.\u201dHere, she pauses, and casts a glance at Artemis, as if asking permission. After a moment, she receives a nod, and continues.\u201cOn one fateful day, I decided to test my knowledge in a rather dangerous way. By observing and finding patterns in the stations of the guards, and when their shifts change, I was able to identify the schedule they were operating on, and identify a number of imperfections- a number of holes in it. I decided to test one of these holes by sneaking into the forbidden back areas of The Casalesi. After all, I still had a bit of a reputation as the clueless cat, and even if they caught me, I would probably simply be sent back to my cell with some relatively minor punishment.\u201d \u201cAnyway, as I was sneaking along down the hall, one door in particular caught my eye. Not that it was particularly interesting looking, or obviously of any importance, but  it was somewhat wider than the others, with a strange set of smells coming from under it. I turned the knob and proceeded inside, unaware at that point of how dangerous such an action would have been, if there had been any defensive wards on the room.The room I stepped into was like something out of a bard\u2019s horror story. Jars and strange implements lined the walls, and the air tingled with what I now know to have been magic, and there, in the center of the room, was a steel table, with a woman lying on it. Her chest cavity was cut open, the skin peeled back in huge, obscene flaps, putting her internal organs on full display. Strange gold-bound crystal needles stuck into her body at several places, and shackles pinned her limbs to the table. I was disgusted and dumbstruck. Why would someone cut open a dead body? As far as I was aware, dead bodies were nothing more, simply\u2026 dead. Was this what happened to the girls who couldn\u2019t work anymore? Why was she still restrained, even in death? Curious, I made my way over to the cadaver, and looked at its face. Emerald eyes stared up at the ceiling glassily. Then they moved, turning to regard me with a crazed stare.\u201d\u201cI was\u2026 terribly alarmed, to say the very least but I managed not to call out. After a few moments, I screwed up my courage and went back over to her. Her eyes followed me, slowly taking on a tint of sanity as they gazed. I almost threw up in horror. This girl was, somehow, after all that, alive! Seeing her then, it sort of put things in perspective for me. I thought that I was at the bottom of the totem pole. I thought that I had it as bad as anyone ever did- surely, there isn\u2019t a lot in life lower than that of the slave. But yet, there she was, sitting on the table before me, with even less freedom, even more horrible circumstances. That was probably the first time I experienced pity.\u201d\u201cI had no idea what to do. I wanted to help, but I knew that I couldn\u2019t move her. Even though I didn\u2019t have a very thorough understanding of physiology or medicine at that point, with those wounds and the internals of her body\u2026 open, as they were,  if she got away from the influence of whatever was keeping her alive, I understood that she would die.. There was no choice but to leave her to whatever monsters were doing this to her, and hope she survived. With no other help I could offer, I pressed a kiss to her forehead, looked her in the eyes, and told her to be strong, that she would make it through this, and that I would be waiting for her when she did. With my window of escape closing, I then had to hurry from the room, and back to my cell, leaving her alone again.\u201d\u201cI never got another chance to sneak back and see her. I\u2019m unsure why, or if my little escapade was ever noticed, but the guards changed their routine, closing the weakness I had used before. For weeks, all I could do was wonder what happened to her. If she had died, or been dissected or\u2026 It pained me to consider, but I couldn\u2019t help it. Then, one day, the cell door opened, and the guards roughly tossed in a young woman to take the place of the one who had hung herself the week before, the tiny trickle of blood on her ear under her \u201848\u2019 tag testifying to how recently she had arrived.The door closed, and she turned to look at me.\u201d\u201cAs it turned out, the woman from the table had survived, and was sitting next to me on the floor. After some initial awkward introductions, we began to talk, and she revealed that she had knowledge, but no memories. She could describe the Norkari Mountains, for instance, but she couldn\u2019t form a mental picture of them. She didn\u2019t remember how she got here; she didn\u2019t remember her name. I suppose we were similar, in that regard. However, we didn\u2019t get any further than that before the shift started. The cell opened again, and we were escorted into the main room. On the way, I tried to tell her some things about how the brothel worked, to prepare her for the new torment she was now a part of. That was before she went down on her John like a seasoned professional, finishing him off just before I finished mine. Some small part of me was impressed, but that showing stopped me from trying to tell her any more about how things worked around there. She already knew.\u201d\u201cWhen we were taken back to our cells after \u2018working\u2019, we resumed our conversation over our rations. The topic of names came up again, and she asked me what mine was. When I told her I didn\u2019t have one, only my number and some of the nicknames the men had given me, she insisted that wouldn\u2019t do, and that I must pick a name. I threw my mind back to one of the stories Mr. P had given me, thinking one of the character names would work. That act triggered something, I\u2019m not sure what, and the name Naoki sprung to mind. I\u2019m unsure as to why, the closest character name in the book was \u2018Nami\u2019. When I told her the name, she said that it didn\u2019t sound important enough, that I needed a title. 'Madame Naoki', she proclaimed. I laughed, and said that would work well enough. Then she asked me to choose a name for her. It somehow didn\u2019t seem appropriate to name her after a fictional character - even though I was about to do that for myself - so I recalled Mr. P\u2019s religious text. In that text, the story of one of the angels had struck me. Swift and strong, striking down her foes with unerring precision in the name of her goddess. I told her the name, but asked if she wouldn\u2019t like a last name too.\u201d\u201cIf one name is good enough for you, one name is good enough for me, she replied simply.\u201d\u201cI responded equally simply:\u00a0Well. then let me introduce myself. My name is Madame Naoki. Good to meet you, Artemis.\u201d", "1461876796000": "While Kate stands, Naoki remains seated, leaning forward to knit her fingers together and rest elbows on knees. Instead of looking up to meet Kate\u2019s gaze, she turns her head downward to consider the space on the floor between Kate\u2019s shoes. \u201cWell. To continue being completely honest with you, I have good reason to suspect that Grandma isn\u2019t quite\u2026 of this world. At the very least, she\u2019s much farther from human than I am. She did\u2026 some strange things with souls. I never inquired too deeply into her affairs, but I don\u2019t think that I quite understood her motives, and doubt that her motives can truly be understood. I\u2019m thankful that she gave us the opportunity that she did, but I\u2019m not sure why she did so\u2026 The Black Tower, too. She started that, built it up, then disappeared, leaving me with the reins. I don\u2019t know. Maybe she saw something in me - the things that I\u2019ve done, the lives that I have crushed, the ones who have become monsters in my name.\u201d Amber eyes dart to the side, meeting Artemis\u2019s gaze for a split second before returning to the floor. \u201cMaybe she saw that I was just as much of a monster as she was. A suitable successor, even.\u201d A flicker of disgust passes over Naoki\u2019s face.With that stated, Naoki abruptly joins Kate in standing, seeming to have recovered. She manages to force a small smile, and offers an outstretched arm, to be taken, lead into an embrace, or thrown aside as Kate sees fit. \u201cRegardless. They said correctly; thank you for listening. It feels\u2026 liberating, to share that, get it off my chest. Would you like to continue to the greenhouse from here, or\u2026? It\u2019s up to you.\u201d", "1462137200000": "With a smile that is now sincere, Naoki nods, and follows Kate down the hall, enjoying the double sensations of their hands on hips. How does she manage it, Naoki wonders. How does she manage to be so\u2026 soothing. So warm, so comforting. All the time. Though mere presence and a few comforting words, Kate is always able to calm Naoki down, and make things seem fine. That\u2019s another reason, Naoki realizes. In an even better state of mind than before the conversation, Naoki proceeds into the greenroom, and is rather impressed. Though she has no metric by which to judge the quality of the soil or the tools, it is much larger than it seemed on the plans, the roof quite high overhead. That, and it is very comfortably warm, which is very much to Naoki\u2019s preference.However, Naoki\u2019s personal preferences are irrelevant in this context; this isn\u2019t her greenhouse. Instead, she looks to Kate, an eyebrow raised with trepidation. Would she find it suitable? ", "1462278289000": "At Kate\u2019s very first impressions, Naoki\u2019s brow wrinkles. \u2018Alright\u2019? This one-of-a-kind growing facility had cost more than the Moonlight Eclipse to build. The logistical and engineering challenges involved in creating this environment all the way up in the Norkari Mountains had required the involvement of not only Naoki\u2019s prized architect, Mr. Ruben, but also a board of runic, warding, and farming experts, to speak nothing of the materials used. She had even contracted one of the Land Tillers' State\u2019s foremost experts in growing things outside of their regular environment! \u201cWell, just say the word, and I\u2019ll have a platoon of second rate gardeners in here to assist you. Whatever you need to realize your visions- I will see it done. Whatever you want, full stop, just say the word.\u201dThat\u2019s an idea, though. Perhaps Kate would like to visit the Land Tillers\u2019 State sometime. She could probably teach them a thing or two, Naoki muses. Perhaps collect some samples of things to bring back here. Naoki would need to contract more of their experts to build another greenhouse worthy of Kate\u2019s praise anyway, may as well visit the source. Regardless, Naoki finds herself unable to remain dissatisfied with the apparent failing of her work to impress. She was hoping for a reaction involving significantly more squealing and perhaps some thank-you hugs, but that infectious smile seems to be quite enough to bring a similar one to Naoki\u2019s face. Naoki\u2019s reply to the statement following Kate\u2019s last one is slightly delayed as she studies her lover and attempts to make sense of the somewhat unusual emphasis placed on the word \u2018myself\u2019. She isn\u2019t quite sure what to make of it. But then again, that would presumably be the point of the conversation that is presumably soon to follow. To make proper sense and gain a factual understanding of Kate\u2019s past, the vague hints she\u2019s been dropping up until the point, and other such related topics. Topics that have been a constant source of curiosity for everyone\u2019s favorite cat. \u201cOf course, by all means. There isn\u2019t anything I would like to hear about more.\u201dFortunately enough, in his design of the greenhouse, Mr. Ruben had seen it fit to include a number of wooden tables with matching benches, somewhat akin to a standard picnic table. Though they\u2019re probably intended to be used for some manner of practical botany process, Naoki figures they\u2019ll probably be better for telling stories than sitting on the floor, or in one of the beds of soil, so she gestures toward the closest one, suggesting that Kate lead the way over and be seated to tell her tale. ", "1462534295000": "As Kate offers a preamble to her story, Naoki is rather surprised. She had been expecting a tragic tale, yes, with some level of unusual circumstance, but nothing quite so\u2026 dangerously confidential. Still, fair enough; Naoki is willing to do much more for Kate than simply keep secrets. Though her earring doesn\u2019t come out, all shimmering and glimmering comes to a halt as she gradually ceases all communication and safely disables the otherwise continuous scrying of Reese\u2019s. She hopes that Kate won\u2019t take her seeming refusal to remove the earring as any sort of disrespect, but figures that it\u2019s best not to interrupt, and the matter can be explained later anyway.  Regardless, Naoki listens carefully as Kate relates the details of her childhood, retaining each and every word as she tends to. A portion of her mind wanders, attempting to put herself in those metaphorical shoes. To have a parental figure, the mere concept of it is an interesting and foreign one to Naoki. She had been putting more thought into the matter as of late- dealing with Skarlet and all, but to hear Kate refer to her father with such admiration and reverence\u2026 It\u2019s interesting, at the very least. Worth more thought later- should focus on the matter at hand. The note about Kate\u2019s eyes, and her unknown mother is another bit that piques Naoki\u2019s interest. She knows full well that she and Kate seemingly have the very same set of amber eyes. The passing thought that they may be in some way related is mildly off-putting, but highly unlikely, Naoki figures. Well. Who is she to say, she supposes. Too many unknowns to say anything with any degree of certainty. The comment about the other children regarding Kate as abnormal rubs Naoki in entirely the wrong direction. So what if she\u2019s got strangely colored eyes and hair? Who doesn\u2019t, in this day and age? They\u2019re beautiful, dammit. To think that some children were raised so intolerantly as to discriminate based on such inconsequential thing as color\u2026 ugh. Naoki finds it disgusting to think about. Naoki has had a few \u201cfreak\u201d comments leveled in her direction as well, but they were no more justified. Human nature is awful, Naoki muses. She doesn\u2019t understand how some can be so idealistic in the context of human nature when humans so regularly make such a mess about things as inconsequential as the mere color of one\u2019s eyes. Disgust aside however, Naoki again doesn't interrupt. She knows that Kate knows fully well what she thinks of those eyes of hers, and if she was searching for further confirmation, the way in which Naoki\u2019s own eyes are gazing into them ought to be plenty. As Kate breaks into tears, Naoki instinctually extends her arms and leans over to offer her shoulder. Though she hasn\u2019t thought about it consciously up until this very moment, she supposes that it is her job to support Kate in the same way. Everyone needs a shoulder to lean on sometimes, she supposes. Even the likes of these three fools sitting on the bench. She\u2019s cried on Kate\u2019s shoulder on\u2026 quite a few occasions, goodness knows, this small gesture is the least she can do. Naoki attempts to emulate the same warm sort of feel that she herself has been so comforted by in the past, but finds herself without words. The words are the important part, she knows, but how can she be expected to say something comforting when she isn\u2019t even quite sure what\u2019s wrong? Something to do with her father, obviously, but what? Figuring that silence is probably superior to saying something obnoxiously general like \u201cIt will be alright\u201d, Naoki keeps her mouth shut, but attempts to be present and comforting in whatever way she can. For Artemis, at least, simply being there physically is quite enough. In her silence Naoki regrets not adding a kerchief or two to her ensemble; now would be an excellent time for one. ", "1464292694000": "As Kate continues with her story, each new development, each turn the story takes adds a new emotional ingredient to the metaphorical stew pot that is Naoki\u2019s mental state. Revulsion. Sorrow. Greif. Pity. Sympathy for Kate\u2019s deceased father, having been apparently forced into such heinous acts out of love. The uncomfortable truth that her lover\u2019s hands were not quite as idealistically clean of blood as Naoki had initially thought. Not particularly enjoyable feelings, any of them. But necessary, like the story itself, and Naoki\u2019s story that preceded it. While not quite as pleasant conversations as, say, the one they shared on the mountain outcropping about the nature of happiness, what with the (excellent) ear fondling and such that came during and afterward, these sorts of conversations are necessary to better understand the other, and deepen the relationship. Even with Naoki\u2019s nascent understanding of relationships wherein one party isn\u2019t trying to exploit the other, this would seem to be the case.  It certainly feels that way, at least. However, within the frothing mix of thoughts and feelings, there is at least one certainty. Managing to maintain a reasonable facsimile of external composure, she gently attempts to pull one of Kate\u2019s hands into her own, and makes eye contact, attempting to channel her highest degree of sincerity into the words, \u201cI will tell no one. That is a secret that has no valid reason to be shared; I\u2019ll not so much as mention any of this to anyone, or even bring it up with you if you\u2019d prefer to not discuss it further. This I promise.\u201dWith that solemn vow given, Naoki returns her focus to processing the information recently bestowed upon her. The concept of loss is still largely foreign to her, and seems infinitely more traumatic than her own story, when presented as such. Loss is something that Naoki can sympathise with and fear, but not something she can truly empathise with; not something she can truly understand, lacking any relatable experiences. Lacking any parental figures, relatives, or other miscellaneous family-like figures, the only individuals who would be truly capable of inflicting lasting grief are- as callous as it feels to admit mentally, sitting right here at the table with her. Others would be missed, and mourned, yes, but would ultimately be gotten over. Remembered fondly, but not constantly. And here, in stark contrast, sits Kate. Who not only had an excellent parental figure, who not only was forced to watch them be not only affected, not only largely consumed by what would sound like some manner of parasite, but to watch them become not themselves. And to take their father\u2019s life, to burn their body, tell no one, and carry the burden completely alone, for\u2026 how long? Probably several years, at this point. And then, on top of all of that, to know that her father did it all apparently out of love for her, and then also to have the lingering fear that the research will be discovered and used on more individuals, robbing them of their\u2026 individuality?Kate wasn\u2019t quite clear on the specifics of the solution\u2019s symptoms, but regardless, the understanding that they were terrible came across quite clearly. Even from a purely objective standpoint, setting aside the personal trauma for a moment, Kate\u2019s greatest fear seems fully justified to Naoki. If that was simply the early stages of whatever parasitic nonsense was at play, and again, if the notes could be believed\u2026 If those notes got into the wrong hands, the likes of Goraia, for example... That would become a massive international crisis in many ways, very quickly. And\u2026 thinking about Kate\u2019s closing words a bit more thoroughly\u2026 was that an offhand proposal, at the very end? ... It sort of was, Naoki supposes. Another handful of emotions for the pot. Excitement, giddiness, and a touch of anxiousness. But those emotions and that prospect that will have to simmer for a moment, because there\u2019s another burning question on Naoki\u2019s mind. One that is, strangely enough, more pressing. Slowly, she voices it with a hint of trepidation, \u201cWhy not destroy the notes?\u201dIt seems like a question that ought to be asked, she figures. It would seem to Naoki that it would simply be common sense to burn the notes right along with the body and the lab. But based on how Kate described the situation, it would be implied that she deliberately removed the notes from the lab to hide them, the reasoning for which is not immediately obvious, and actually seems rather counterintuitive. \u201c... Or... at least keep them somewhere where you can watch them.\u201dThere\u2019s probably some logical reason for Kate doing what she did in regards to the notes, but if her largest fear is them being discovered, would it not make sense to see that they couldn\u2019t be discovered? It may be overstepping her bounds to ask, Naoki knows, but if she doesn\u2019t, the question will linger and grow to nag irritate her, so it\u2019s probably for the best to simply ask it now and not have to bring up the painful topic again later. ", "1464560478000": "\u201cThen the pool it shall be.\u201dNaoki stands as she is poked, and dutifully follows Kate to the exit, taking her time to consider both the view and what that exchange of confessions had meant, and will mean going forward. It means\u2026 an awful lot. More than can be adequately considered before Naoki draws abreast of Kate at exit of the greenhouse, and turns to glance to the left. She hesitates for a moment, tail flicking as she metaphorically changes gears to consult the home\u2019s floor plan, and routes a path from their location to the pool. Funnily enough, it doesn\u2019t particularly matter which direction they choose at this intersection. Naoki nods in affirmation, and takes the first step down the corridor leading to the left. Smiling lightest and most sincere of smiles, Yet, as pleased as she was to drop the topic and watch Kate\u2019s mood visibly brighten, something about all of that doesn\u2019t quite sit properly with Naoki. Seems like the sort of thing that will come back around for a second round of trauma later on down the line. If not through the notes being found and finding their way into the wrong hands, perhaps Kate will be forced to retrieve the notes to wield them in defense against some similar threat. Regardless, Naoki supposes, it doesn\u2019t particularly matter at this point. If something ever does come up in regards to the white serum, it will be her job to stand with Kate and assist her in whatever needs to be done. Until then, as far as Naoki is concerned, the whole thing can be filed away and she can start thinking about more important things. The best way to make love in a pool, for instance... The three of them, Kate, Naoki, and Artemis spend the remainder of the week up at The Chalet. The snowstorm comes and goes, and many good times and long talks are had. However, as with all good things, their vacation eventually comes to an end. The teleportation conduit is completed, enabling essentially instantaneous and free transportation between The Chalet and The Midnight Sun. As their schedules permit, more time is shared over the next few months, but that first uninterrupted week will likely become a lasting memory to cherish. (Naoki really doesn\u2019t have much choice in the matter, but regardless. Good week.)", "1465453951000": "Presently, Naoki meanders her way into the room. On this fine evening, an equally fine lounging robe adorns her figure; black, patterned simply with a red rose across the right lapel. In her left hand, held carefully by the handle, is Naoki\u2019s mug, steaming away quietly. In the other, a book, held partially open with one finger as a makeshift placeholder. \u201cJun.\u201dA statement, a greeting. A warm one, at that. As she moves to seat herself in an adjacent chair, the hints of a smile are present on her face, and if her body language is anything to go by, Naoki is somewhat pleased to see Jun. Placing the book face-down across her lap, setting her mug on an adjacent table, and crossing her legs at the ankle, Naoki turns to face Jun, and intones warmly, \u201cIt\u2019s good to see you. I\u2019m pleased that you\u2019ve had the opportunity to drop by. How have you been?\u201d", "1465465106000": "For a long handful of moments, Naoki says nothing, eyes trained on the opposite wall. She takes a sip of her drink- something chocolatey, judging by the smell, and mulls the matter over. After a short while though, she speaks.\u201cI see. I suppose there\u2019s not much to be done about the matter, then. As I understand, angering her would be akin to angering the ocean itself. And that\u2019s not an enemy I\u2019m prepared to fight.\u201dAnother sip of her drink.\u201cYet.\u201d \u201cThat, and you\u2019ll recall what I said during the initial formation of our agreements. Forcing you to steal it would not only be an injustice to you as a friend, but a literal violation of that contract. So we\u2019ll have to find some alternative means by which to procure\u2026 or perhaps produce a crystal of the sort I\u2019m looking for. There were a few other minor leads, and I\u2019ll have them investigated now.\u201dNaoki\u2019s earring glimmers for a moment as she issues the relevant instructions and relays Jun\u2019s report back to Sun Marshal Command. Though that wasn\u2019t exactly the best news Jun could have delivered, it doesn\u2019t seem to have taken the edge off Naoki\u2019s pleasant mood. Turning back to face Jun, Naoki takes yet another sip of her drink before continuing, \u201cBeyond that, though, how are you? I wasn\u2019t really looking for your report, to be honest, that was a genuine inquiry into your state of being.\u201d", "1465520695000": "As Jun sputters, Naoki exhales sharply, somewhat amused. It doesn\u2019t take a genius to figure out where Jun was going with that; she did mention Valear directly during their meeting at The Eclipse, after all. It\u2019s a shame that Jun isn\u2019t willing to discuss the topic with Naoki. Hopefully she\u2019ll warm up soon enough, but there\u2019s not too much to be done about that just now, she supposes. \u201cHmm. Well, to be honest, my favorite pastime is love-making. I enjoy bringing the most direct form of pleasure to others. Especially those I care about. It\u2019s good exercise, I\u2019m good at it, it\u2019s enjoyable for all involved\u2026 There\u2019s nothing not to like, as far as I\u2019m concerned.\u201d\u201cAnd, though my offer stands, I suppose you were sort of looking for suggestions that you\u2019ve not been obligated by your \u2018cauldron\u2019  not to try.\u201dA small wink and an almost playful nudge imply that Naoki is more perceptive than Jun might have given her credit for. \u201cWhen I\u2019ve got free time and no one to spend it with, I tend to simply sit and relax- either reading or meditating. Somewhere warm and comfortable. I\u2019m sure you can imagine, my work is rather wearisome, and it\u2019s almost mandatory that I de-stress on a regular basis. One of my favorite places to relax is in the sauna. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve ever had the pleasure, but there\u2019s something about the sauna that is truly excellent for my mood. You should definitely try one of ours sometime; perhaps join Artemis and I for a session. She\u2019s an excellent masseur.\u201dUncharacteristically enough, there is no undertone of sultriness in the sauna invitation. After another sip of her drink, Naoki continues, \u201cI also enjoy casual social encounters. Like this one, for instance. I enjoy simply sitting about, speaking with individuals that are enjoyable to chat with. I spend an awful lot of time speaking in decidedly not-causal contexts as part of my obligations. All sorts of officials to meet with, diplomatic encounters and such. So it\u2019s refreshing to sit down with someone like you- without a specific goal to the conversation. I have no agenda to further by speaking with you right now, and that\u2019s a pleasant sort of thing.\u201dFor a moment, she pauses, taking another sip of her drink, and composing her thoughts. \u201cBeyond that, recently, I\u2019ve taken up archery. And I\u2019ve been enjoying that. It\u2019s an elegant sort of thing. It\u2019s good exercise, it\u2019s excellent for one\u2019s posture, and I find it\u2026 again, rather relaxing. It\u2019s easy for me to focus my attention on the singular- if not quite simple task of planting my arrow where I\u2019d like it to go. There\u2019s a lot involved in what seems like a simple enough task. It\u2019s an excellent way to practice self-control, and learn a potentially useful skill at the same time. If you\u2019d like to join me to practice sometime, I would enjoy your company, and you might enjoy the sport as much as I do.\u201d\u201cMy suggestion to you, though, based on what you seem be alluding to there, is to slow down a bit. Settle down. Spend some time to yourself. You\u2019ve been very busy for a long while, now. You should take some time off from your regular world-saving and adventuring to spend some time on yourself. Spend some time in introspection, and figure out what you want to do. Spend a few days here. Be idle. Read some. Relax. Bring your 'cauldron' up here, and maybe boil some things with him. Perhaps set yourself a goal. I always find it much easier to take action when I know what I want. Right now, my three broadest goals are to be the best Lady of Isra I can be, be the best me I can be for my partner, and improve my ability to do both. All of my important plans fall into one of those three goals, and it\u2019s not very difficult to decide what I\u2019d like to do by keeping those three goals in mind and aiming to fulfill them each as well as I can. You should do the same thing. Set some goals for yourself, and then think about how to best accomplish them.\u201dRealizing that Jun was probably not looking for that level of rambling advice, Naoki stops her monologue and looks to Jun in an attempt to judge her response.", "1465640796000": "As Jun speaks, Naoki listens, occasionally taking sips of her drink. Interesting that she doesn\u2019t speak of Valear as anything more than a sex object. Well. It would be sort of strange- in the context in the metaphor, to say that the cauldon is \u2018a good listener\u2019. Or \u2018companionable\u2019. Or any of those sorts of descriptors, really. But still! The metaphor was getting stretched as it is. She could have alluded to something other than his sexual prowess. Naoki hopes, having learned better, for Jun\u2019s sake, the man has something else to offer. That the relationship develops into something beyond whispering sweet, romantic nothings and the occasional roll in the hay. Jun deserves better than just that. But again, and somewhat frustratingly, the matter is tabled for now. Naoki continues listening as Jun goes on, smirking slightly but not making any move to prevent Jun from resting her head where she pleases. \u201cYou might like Kate, then. Gardening is\u2026 that\u2019s her thing. It\u2019s her area of expertise, and her skills in that chosen field of hers are nigh-unmatched. I\u2019ll admit that I am subject to a fair amount of bias, but I\u2019d say she\u2019s the best. There\u2019s a greenhouse\u2026\u201dWith a lazy sort of motion, Naoki waves in a direction off to their left with her mug.\u201cAttached to the rear of the Chalet here, in addition to her primary shop in Isra. She does all sorts of things in there with plants I can\u2019t even begin to identify. \u2026 It\u2019s amazing. When you say the word \u2018gardening\u2019 I think of\u2026 small things. Vegetables. Herbs, little hand-shovels. But she\u2019s got these massive leafy things in there with flowers larger than she is. Vines around every which way, wrapping themselves around anything that stays still for too long. I\u2019m convinced some of the plants are semi-sentient, the way they react to her.\u201dHere, Naoki pauses for a moment. Probably in pleasant recollection, if the light smile is anything to go by. \u201cAs for me\u2026 it\u2019s not quite that I haven\u2019t tried. I have, on a few occasions. It\u2019s just not quite as\u2026 interesting? Fulfilling? I don\u2019t find gardening as enjoyable as all that, though. It\u2019s dirty work, for one thing. I\u2019ve grown a healthy distaste for dirt. That, and it\u2019s not\u2026 I mean. It is a science. But it\u2019s one that I have a hard time wrapping my head around. I work in numbers. Numbers, and words, and things that can be quantified and expressed and studied. Mathematics, logistics, politics, economics, those sorts of things. Botany\u2026 Botany is almost comparable to medicine. You can standardize your approach all you like, but in the end, it\u2019ll always come down to personal appraisal and judgment. I find it difficult to make decisions about things when I don\u2019t understand them. To draw a comparison, I understand Isra\u2019s economy, even though I don\u2019t have an intimate knowledge of each individual portion of it. But I don\u2019t understand a Narslimmus- or whatever else she has in there in the same way. I can be told about plants. When and how much to water, and such things as that. And following those sorts of instructions aren\u2019t any more difficult for me than anything else. But when it comes down to applying my judgement to something in front of me, alive, I flounder. When I can\u2019t be assured that my decision is at least the best one I could make at the time, I have trouble making any decision at all. And\u2026 for things like gardening, where the lives of the plants lie in the balance, that trait works against me. I can appreciate nature, but don\u2019t ask me to maintain it beyond the simplest and most mundane manner of gardening.\u201dBefore addressing Jun\u2019s inquiry about her family, Naoki takes a few moments of silence. It\u2019s considerative sort of silence, as she decides on and formulates her response. \u201cWell, you\u2019ve met Artemis, have you not? And you\u2019ve visited The Midnight Sun? That\u2019s the entirety of my \u2018family\u2019, past and present, as I would define it. I have no knowledge pertaining to the circumstances of my birth or ancestry. If I even have either of those things. I, as I understand myself, was brought into this world alone. As such, I\u2019ve made do with the cards I was metaphorically dealt. And that was Artemis. She and I are alike in that manner, and have adopted each other, forming a unique sort of relationship I\u2019ll not go into further.\u201dAnother, longer section of considerative silence as Naoki ponders how to proceed.\u201cAnd\u2026 as for\u2026 \u2018my people\u2019...\u201d Naoki trails off again before continuing in a decidedly factual and almost expressionless tone.\u201cAs far as I\u2019m aware, I am one of a kind. There are individuals who are similar, sure. I know a woman; Ms. Cynder. She\u2019s nice enough; named one of her children after me. She\u2019s essentially an anthropomorphic cat, with blue fur all over. Her children- which she had with Alden, they look very much like small, blue-eared versions of myself.  More adorable than should be permitted by Isra\u2019s laws, in my opinion. And while it may be tempting to simply take that at face value and assume that I was conceived in the same way, there are a number of small differences. You\u2019ll notice\u2026\u201dNaoki turns, rising in her seat  to face Jun head-on, moving a lock of hair to the side in order to display her face clearly.\u201cI have no whiskers, and no facial markings of any sort. My pupils are circular, not slit-shaped, and I cannot purr any more than you can. If I recall correctly, Alden\u2019s children do have whiskers and slit shaped eyes. And I\u2019ll be damned if my namesake didn\u2019t purr when I held her. Cheeky little bugger, she is.\u201dLeaning back down into her seat, Naoki cups her mug with both hands, drawing the warmth out into her palms as she continues, allowing a touch of emotion to make its way into her inflection at the same time.\u201cThe same can be said for other cat-like individuals. They\u2019re never quite the same. My particular set of features is just that. Paticular. I\u2019ve had myself looked at by some of the more talented medical minds of our generation. As far as anyone can tell, I am distinctly unique on the face of this world.\u201d\u201cA being all my own, sharing characteristics with some, but kinship with none.\u201dOn that somewhat somber note, Naoki stops speaking. Leaning further back into her seat, she contemplates another draw from her mug, but shelves both the idea and the mug, setting it off to one side and allowing her to gaze off into space unimpeded. ", "1465776769000": "As Skarlet enters the room, Naoki raises a hand in greeting, \u201cAh, Skarlet, good to see you.\u201dSeeing as the two have gone ahead and introduced themselves to each other, Naoki fields Skarlet\u2019s inquiry. \u201cA sauna is a special sort of room built to experience heat sessions. The sort that I prefer function by dropping water onto stones heated with fire magic, creating steam. The room fills up with steam, and the idea is such that you sit or lie on benches and relax. I\u2019m rather partial to the heat, and participate in regular sauna sessions to de-stress. Rather than take my word for it, I invite you to join Jun and I for a session right now.\u201dLeaving her book and mug on the table, Naoki rises from her seat, and after taking a moment to stretch, begins to meander toward the hallway, expecting Jun and Skarlet to follow. As she walks, Naoki\u2019s earring glimmers slightly as she responds to Jun telepathically. \u201cYes, perhaps, and there are some benefits of being unattached, but I meant the literal definition of kinship. The things you\u2019ve taken for granted, having a mother, a father, a clan; those who care about you, and protect you. I was given none of those things. I can envy those who were freely given what I have had to fight tooth and nail to earn, and kill to protect. I have done so, and built a family I am proud of, but it hasn\u2019t been easy. It\u2019s nice to be idealistic about that sort of thing you described, and I appreciate your confidence in me, but I doubt you can truly empathise in this case.\u201dLeading the way down the halls, Naoki guides the group in the direction of one of the Chalet\u2019s numerous saunas. ", "1466170183000": "Moving into the preparation room, Naoki responds to Skarlet\u2019s inquiry. \u201cThat would be the idea, yes. You could choose to use a towel, wrapped either around your waist or beneath your elbows, but I find that detracts too much from even heating. Instead, I prefer to place a small cloth across my face, like this one.\u201dFrom one of the shelves, Naoki selects a towel only slightly larger than her own outstretched hand. After displaying it, she places it on one end of the bench, evidently intending to utilize it. \u201cYou figure, the concentration of blood is higher in one\u2019s head, so insulating it some helps to balance that out. I\u2019m not qualified to speak at length about the powers behind it, but I find it most comfortable, and would suggest it. Try what you like, it isn\u2019t as if this will be your only opportunity to experience the sauna. And one can always things off.\u201dTo punctuate that statement, Naoki undoes the loose knot holding the front of her robe shut. (Which is apparently her only article of clothing.) While it would be breathtaking to allow it to cascade down the curves her figure and crumple to the floor, this- with only Skarlet on her side of the barrier, is neither the time nor place. And the floor is a bit wet, besides. Instead, she carefully removes the robe, folding it dutifully before placing it on one of the shelves intended for holding such things. Bending at the knees, Naoki picks up the cloth she placed onto the bench, and follows Jun into the sauna proper completely unabashedly, trusting Skarlet to proceed in at her own pace. Always skilled with prioritization, Naoki first casts a glance in Jun\u2019s direction, taking an appropriately appreciative but not quite awkward amount of time to observe her posture, figure, and\u2026 scars. Interesting. It stands to reason that Jun would have been significantly harmed, what with the sorts of adventures she fills her time with. But she also hangs out with the likes of Miss Lum, whose restorative magic- as far as Naoki is aware, is unmatched. If Jun is wearing scares, that would seem to imply that she\u2019d like to be. Perhaps she\u2019d speak about them later. If not, though, Naoki figures, she won\u2019t be too terribly disappointed. The primary reason Naoki might care to discuss it, beyond simple curiosity, would be to develop the discussion into a philosophical one starting in the realm of one\u2019s body and its role in\u2026 things. And that line of conversation could be initiated with a less potentially-touchy subject. Regardless, Naoki\u2019s gaze doesn\u2019t linger as she turns away with a slight smirk. The only scrap of cloth in her possession, is held casually in her left hand as she bends at the waist, down to address the rune panel embedded into the floor. At her touch, water springs from some hidden tap in the ceiling. Down, through the center of the room like a pillar it falls, diffusing through the grate with light splashing sounds, and down onto the rocks below. Upon making contact with the rocks, the water evaporates essentially instantaneously, suggesting that the rocks are quite hot. The steam billows back up through the grate with little to no apparent effort, being a gss and such. It continues to billow all the way up to the ceiling, filling the room with steam. With a satisfied sort of sigh, Naoki straightens, takes a moment to observe the process to ensure there are no apparent issues, and, finding none, nods to herself. With the sauna properly begun, she wastes no time in stepping off to the left side of the room and up to the uppermost ring of benches. Moving into position, Naoki decides to begin this session on her stomach. Because variety. Folding the cloth in half once, she sets it down toward one end of the bench before settling down into a lying position, folding her arms up around her head, resting the side of her face on the back of her upper hand with feet pointed down toward the opposite wall. After attaining this position, Naoki\u2019s eyes shut softly, and her breathing slows and deepens. Though she seems perfectly at ease, one ear remains trained in Jun\u2019s direction, while the other is pointed in the direction of the door, anticipating Skarlet\u2019s entry. ", "1466247584000": "As Jun\u2019s towel drops, Naoki sit sup up slightly to rest her chin on the back of her folded hands, watching as ss Jun goes on to describe the source of each scar, Naoki\u2019s eyes follows along, digesting the information. Her expression is one of polite and pleasant interest, watching with a casual air of attentiveness. Though it isn\u2019t particularly useful information, persay, it\u2019s interesting information to be sure; Naoki is always pleased to learn more about her closest compatriots.As Jun finishes, Naoki turns her gaze upon Skarlet as she relates the abbreviated version of her life story, obviously omitting the more personal portions prior to her transformation. It\u2019s rather pleasing, she muses, to see Jun and Skarlet apparently getting on rather well with each other. After Skarlet concludes her bit, Naoki thinks to herself for a moment. Now would be a fine time to make a contribution to the conversation. But what to say. Insecurity regarding one\u2019s body is a foreign concept, she isn\u2019t at all qualified to speak to Jun on the matter. A comment on how cute she finds the scars would add a sexual undertone to the room that isn\u2019t yet present, and one that Naoki- unusually enough, isn\u2019t keen on creating. It would be pleasant to do this again, after all, and saying something like that in Skarlet\u2019s presence might give her the wrong idea. With this in mind, Naoki opts to steer the conversation in another direction. \u201cLet me hit you with this line of inquiry, Jun. I\u2019d like to know more about The Expanse, from your perspective. You\u2019ve not spoken to me much about it without any larger context, and I would be willing to bet that you have a unique perspective, between being a native of the region, and having journeyed so much of the world to have a very wide frame of reference with which to compare it to.\u201dSettling back down, Naoki rests her right cheek on the back of her hand, looking sideways to Jun for a response.", "1466316386000": "As Jun relates her assessments and makes eye contact, Nanoki reciprocates, staring into those almond eyes to obtain a sense of the gravity in her words. After an appropriate number of moments have passed, Naoki nods solemnly. At least, as much as one can nod while lying on one\u2019s stomach. \u201cSee, now that\u2019s the sort of perspective I can\u2019t get from anyone else.\u201dAs she mulls over Jun\u2019s statements, Naoki decides that it\u2019s time to flip. Pushing herself up off the bench, Naoki rolls over to lie on her back. Her tail finds its way into a crease between the boards, and wraps itself up between her legs to rest over her left knee and dangle off the side of the bench, waving slightly. Before responding properly to Jun, Naoki answers Skarlet, \u201cSkarlet, if you\u2019re not comfortable or feeling faint, feel free to stand up and walk out. It\u2019s supposed to feel hot, and one is intended to sweat, but if you don\u2019t enjoy the sensation, you don\u2019t have to stay. Try lying down, maybe.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s worth keeping in mind though, Jun, that you sort of already are. Strong enough to defend The Expanse, I mean. Do you possess the same raw strength as your grandmother did, or the wisdom of Havador? Perhaps not; not yet. But you have two things that make your dream very much an achievable one in my eyes. For one thing, I think you\u2019re well suited to the concept, on a personal level. Look at yourself now. You\u2019re in your early twenties, and already you\u2019re among the most talented of magic users in this world. You're a prodigy; there are only a small handful of individuals, even among my own pool of warriors, who would even be able to pose a challenge to you. You\u2019ve handled matters of incredible danger and of the utmost severity before, and have come out on top in each instance. With a few scars, perhaps, but considering the sheer number of things you\u2019ve fought, it\u2019s a miracle you\u2019re not dead.\u201d\u201cThat, and there\u2019s also the other way in which individuals are powerful. The manner in which I am powerful; the social aspect. Consider your allies for just a moment. Just- half a moment, off the top of your head, consider who would be willing to lend you aid in the event of some attack against The Expanse.\u201dNaoki pauses for a breath, allowing Jun to consider the matter.\u201cThe list is substantial, to say the very least. You\u2019ve cultivated a network of powerful allies in much the same way I have. And by joining me, developing this relationship we share, our respective networks have become intertwined. If you needed help, I would do everything reasonably within my power to assist, and trust you would do the same.\u201d\u201cGive yourself a bit of credit, is what I mean to get at. You\u2019ve come a long way. You\u2019ve made friends who will protect you and help you accomplish your goals, whatever they may be. Don\u2019t be so worried. Though the Expanse is young and naive politically, all you need to do is keep doing what you\u2019re doing.\u201dWith this said, Naoki stops speaking. Though she has more to say and ask, she figures it polite to allow Jun to get a word in edgewise. As she awaits a response, she adjusts herself slightly on the bench, shimming into a more comfortable position, and causing her bust to wobble slightly in the process.  ", "1466409464000": "From her prone position, it would be rather strange of Naoki to nod, so instead she murmurs affirmation of what Skarlet said. \u201cMhm. There was artificially induced sort of amnesia involved that resulted in the creation of a new identity and the development of vampirism. Skarlet is- technically speaking, about two years old, even though her body is a bit older than twenty. Through a series of circumstances that brought her to The Midnight Sun in the earlier stages of development, I ended up adopting her. And\u2026 I don\u2019t know. I think it\u2019s working out reasonably well. What do you think, Skarlet? Have any issues to raise with my parenting so far?\u201dOne ear is pointed in Skarlet's direction, awaiting her response.\u00a0", "1466504405000": "A quick flick of Naoki\u2019s ear acknowledges Artemis\u2019 arrival, and a small smile graces her lips as Skarlet states her satisfaction. It\u2019s a fulfilling sort of feeling, Naoki muses. To have a child, and have them be so pleased with the way they are treated. A unique feeling, that isn\u2019t quite comparable to any other. \u201cI\u2019m pleased to hear it. If you ever do have something to say, though, something you think I could be doing better, or something you\u2019d like me to do, don\u2019t hesitate. I\u2019m still pretty new to this whole \u201cmother\u201d business, and want to do the best I can for you.\u201dHere, Naoki stops speaking, content to simply lie and enjoy the twin pleasures of the company of  her companions and the sauna\u2019s heat. Though she has more questions for Jun, now might not be the time. It would be up to another occupant of the sauna to continue the conversation. ", "1471678249000": "On the most quiet of nights beneath the new moon, Madame Naoki makes her way through the halls of The Chalet. Bare feet pad along polished wooden floors, adding only the softest of noises to the otherwise complete silence. In her left hand, she holds a lit candlestick, an amber glow to light the way through the otherwise dark halls- tonight is the night of the new moon. In the other hand, held at her side, is a book- and a rather large book, at that. Almost as thick as it is wide, bound with leather with two hard covers of dark wood and held shut with a leather strip. The weight of it, combined with the unwieldy shape of it has an effect on Naoki\u2019s stride, causing her to lean over to the right to compensate and take shorter steps than she would otherwise. Regardless of her impediment, however, onward through the halls she shuffles, sure in her step- this is a route she has traced many times. Shortly enough, Naoki reaches her destination: a pair of ornately carved double doors, above which a small plaque reads, \u201cLibrary.\u201d Turning her right shoulder to one of the doors, Naoki is careful not to burn herself on the candle as she leverages her weight against the door, pushing it open with a soft and decidedly feminine grunt. With a glimmer of her earring and a casual waving gesture of her tail, one of the library's numerous fireplaces roars to life, casting only enough orangish red light to illuminate the area directly before it, which would seem to be arrayed with desks and tables.Through the shadows, Naoki moves with her candle, casting long, dancing shadows as she moves among the bookcases, before approaching the the fireplace and selecting the table directly before it. Carefully setting the candle and book down upon the tabletop, Naoki doesn\u2019t sit quite yet- instead shuffling back off into the darkness. Moments later, she returns, a stack of parchment in one hand, ink and quill in the other. She sets these items down on the table along with the heavy tome before seating herself. Gently sliding the titanic tome over to sit squarely before her, Naoki examines the book closely for the second time. As established, it is- or at least seems to be, very large, very black, and bound with leather straps. Additionally, Naoki notes the silver boss- and the peculiar sort of symbol it depicts. She knows it to be mirrored on the rear based on her previous examination. It\u2019s an awfully complex symbol to simply keep the cover off the surface of the desk. It must have some manner of meaning, she muses. Probably relating to the content of the book, considering that there are no markings on the spine. Contemplating the matter further, Naoki figures that the item would really be more aptly referred to as a \u2018codex\u2019 and resolves to do so going forward.However, if what Grandma     said regarding where she found this book  codex is true- and Naoki has no reason to believe it isn\u2019t\u2026 This is would be an immense asset to her research. Unclasping the leather strap, Naoki opens the tome to a random page- letting the covers and their bosses rest on the desk. However, on the pages within, lies not the standard and widely known characters of Basic. Nor the  accented language of Gauldish, nor the light curving letters of the Elven alphabet, or any language currently spoken in The Overworld, for that matter. Instead, long and waving lines fill the pages, occasionally interspersed with dots, perpendicular lines, and other assorted symbols.Squinting at the vellum from a little ways back, Naoki remarks to herself that it almost resembles the surface of water- and the other symbols almost resemble ripples, emanating out from points across the page. Slowly, Naoki shakes her head, and amends her previous statement. This would be an immense asset to her research, after she translates it. With that goal in mind, Naoki carefully adjusts the codex on the desk, flipping back to what she understands to be the beginning. Taking her quill in hand, she begins to study the first \u2018words\u2019 of the first page and begin her postulations as to what they mean on the blank parchment she had brought. This translation would- at least for a short while, be a challenging and arduous task. Until she learns to read it, that is. Until then, however, Naoki is content to do it the hard way- using what limited knowledge of the language she has to attempt to interpret and form coherent thoughts out of the strange symbols on the page before her. On though the night and into the next morning, she continues to work, losing track of the time...", "1471933349000": "Tilting one ear backward as Grandma enters the room, Naoki leaves her back turned and her gaze fixed on the bit of text that she\u2019s currently working on. However, she does raise her left hand to offer a small wave as Grandma approaches. \u201cI suppose you could say that, yes. I\u2019m making progress. \u2026 Slow progress, but progress regardless.\u201dNaoki\u2019s decryption process, even if it isn\u2019t very fruitful or very quick, seems to have resulted in an awful lot of scrap-paper. Half-translated words in basic,  her own rendition of the strange wave-like text, and notes about how the language seems to work litter the table. Continuing to split her attention and apparently set on finishing whatever section of work currently has her attention, Naoki speaks again, \u201cPull up a chair if you\u2019d like, what brings you here today?\u201d", "1472058411000": "\u201cMy opinion of Tristian?...\u201dNaoki spends a half-moment to finish whatever it is she\u2019s writing and another to coalesce her thoughts before beginning, leaving her quill on the desk and she turns in her seat to face Grandma.\u201cTristian is almost a perfectly ideal fit for his job. He\u2019s got the management and leadership skills. He\u2019s got the social skills; he\u2019s got every skill he needs, a good few he doesn't, and a very good sort of disposition for the job. He doesn\u2019t lead because he likes to, or because he\u2019s particularly comfortable in the spot, but because someone needs to, and he can, so he does. \u2026 For the most part, at least.\u201d\u201cThere's also the more prominent bit, though, the anger. He\u2019s from Medan, yes? Not to mince words, but his whole family was killed during the coup, and he holds a massive grudge. Just mentioning Goraia around him gets him all red and angry and whatnot. But, in the spot he\u2019s in right now, with the way things exist on the political stage, he can\u2019t take them. Not without Isra or some other significant ally who would need a good reason.\u201d\u201cI have one major concern, and that it\u2019s he\u2019s not very comfortable where he is now; in a position of power, but unable to really do anything- to take any substantial action against Goraia to enact his vengeance. If things remain as they are for too long, he might start trying to do things himself, might start acting against the directives I\u2019ve set, or something else\u2026 rash.\u201dNaoki pauses for a moment, allowing to contemplate for herself what sorts of shenanigans Tristian might get up to, should he put his mind to it.\u201cHowever, I have him by the short and sensitives, as it were. At any point, I can just cut his funding and The Black Tower stops existing essentially overnight. And he\u2019s bound by contract not to reveal me as the one funding it, so he\u2019s really got no room to negotiate. As such, he\u2019ll have to wait until the world is ready to rid itself of Goraia. When the time comes, I\u2019m not sure what to expect. If I should expect the meticulous planning and ruthless execution of many nights spent in hateful contemplation, or the blind rage of a man blinded by grief, wrath, and overwhelming desire for vengeance. ... It'll probably be a bit of both, honestly.\u201dNaoki spends a moment in contemplation, rubbing at her chin as she envisions the scenario. After a moment, she comes to a conclusion,\u201cOverall, Trisitian is an excellent and effective tool, but one that I must be careful with, lest he escape my control.\u201dWith a small nod, Naoki seems to be finished articulating her thoughts.", "1472161928000": "Naoki nods in agreement with Grandma\u2019s assessment. They seem to be on the same page as far as Tristian is concerned. Without anything much more to say, Naoki waits until Grandma poses her next inquiry, and spends a moment in contemplation before responding as such. \u201cIt should be noted first that in the early stages of my reorganization of the government, your Defense Ministry was reshaped into The Judiciary Department of today, with more of an emphasis on- as the name might suggest, Judicial matters and internal affairs, as opposed to literal defense of the state. \u201c\u201cFor a short while- the space of about a month, the new Judiciary Department was overseen by Ryden Greyiron. He was instrumental in establishing the department, setting up its hierarchy and creating protocols- not to mention the corruption issue that the guard force used to have.\u201dImplying, of course, that Ryden saw the corruption issue handled. \u201cIn that position, Ryden brought evidence to bear against and called a vote of no confidence in the Then-Prime-Minister Tyrus, who you\u2019ve met. For better or worse, the vote succeeded, Tyrus was removed, and Ryden was elected into the office afterward.\u201d\u201cShortly following that, the rest of my government reforms were instituted, and Ryden became the Chancellor, leaving the Judiciary Department without a head. In a conversation I shared with him, he suggested that I appoint the then-Inspector Deathforge to the spot.\u201d\u201cDeathforge is some manner of wolf-man. I\u2019m not really quite sure what sort of thing he is, really, but he looks like a wolf, stands on two legs, speaks well enough, and does his job well, so I don\u2019t ask. Beyond that, I don\u2019t know too much about him. He does the work, and he does it well. I\u2019m not quite sure what motivates him, or why he\u2019s effective, but he just does it, so\u2026\u201dNaoki trails off with a shrug. She honestly doesn\u2019t have much more information to provide. ", "1472655936000": "\u201cIs it he to be trusted?\u201dNaoki scoffs.\u201cI trust him about as far as I can throw him. That is to say, I\u2019m willing to let him do what he does, most of the paperwork, and a lot of the more boring administrative task, but not much more. As I read the situation, he deposed Tyrus because Tyrus was ineffectual and not doing all he could in his position. Though it may be presumptuous of me to presume such things, I am not, and thus, I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll attempt to fool with me. Furthermore, he knows what assets I can bring to bear. Some of them, at least. And that\u2019s enough to keep him in check. My network of contacts and employees far outstrips any others, and especially his. And while he may be able to accuse me and use words to fool with my reputation, those things don\u2019t have any effect on the lasting bonds I\u2019ve formed over the years, or the cold, hard cash I pay when serious work needs doing.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s someone to keep an eye on, but not a legitimate threat in my eyes. He will work in my system and take some of the duller burdens from me, but the man isn\u2019t stupid enough to try anything funny, and even if he does, my assassins are better than his.\u201d This is stated with an air of finality, suggesting that Naoki will not accept any other arrangement. ", "1472959235000": "As Grandma stands to peruse the library, Naoki resumes her translation work, again putting her quill to the page and her mind to the task. At Grandma\u2019s inquiry, Naoki shrugs noncommittally, but doesn\u2019t pause in her work. \u201cRelations with Gauldin are about as they\u2019ve been, without any major changes. If anything, I think they\u2019ve improved, but such things are difficult to gauge objectively. I don\u2019t believe that the king has changed much. He\u2019s still a slave to the traditions and bureaucracy of his land, but I still take him to be a fine enough man on the whole. One that would most likely be willing to act in the interests of his nation, rather than the interests of his court, if it truly came to such a thing.\u201dNaoki seems content to leave it at that. There\u2019s not too much more to say, really. Prosperous trade and international comradery between Gauldin and Isra continue, and other than their joint efforts in dealing with the recent crisis, no major interactions between the two powers have taken place. ", "1473198723000": "Naoki\u2019s response is prompt, \u201cIt\u2019s no trouble, come right in.\u201dTurning to address Grandma verbally, Naoki announces, \u201cMs. Emahra Untyrid, one of my Marshals, is here. We\u2019re going to discuss preparations for the upcoming summit as well as what may transpire afterward. I have no issue with you staying, and suspect that you may like to meet Ms. Untyrid, but these preparations are essential and must be completed today, so\u2026\u201dNaoki trails off, allowing Grandma to infer what she may from that. In preparation for Ema\u2019s arrival, Naoki begins to pack up and organize her belongings on the desk, putting a bookmark in and closing the great codex, and shuffling her translation papers into a rough stack. ", "1473220620000": "As Emahra seats herself, Naoki shakes her head, indicating the negative. Gesturing to the paperwork spread across the table, she elaborates plainly, \u201cThis isn\u2019t the summit paperwork.\u201dIndeed, it\u2019s not. The majority of the papers on the desk are still written in the strange wave-script of the codex, which also sits closed upon the table. Gesturing for Emahra to follow her, Naoki rises, leaving everything on the table exactly where it sits; she would come back to it.  A sidelong glance is aimed in Ema\u2019s direction as Naoki watches her stand. She seems out of sorts, which Naoki thinks to be highly uncharacteristic of her. The two of them, Naoki thinks, are similar in that it\u2019s very difficult to catch either in a state that seems unready, much less one that seems so\u2026 disheveled. Regardless, Naoki opts not to pry. Not yet, at least; Grandma is right there. Gesturing again, Naoki keeps her demeanor casual as she leads the way to another portion of the library. At least, that\u2019s how she intends for it to come off. (\u2018Casual\u2019 is much better than \u2018sleepy\u2019.)It\u2019s only a short walk to their destination: a similar sort of table with chairs around the perimeter and a stack of folders sitting in the center. Crossing over to the other side of the table, Naoki seats herself and begins to idly sort through the stack of folders. None of them are labeled, so one has to check the contents themselves to discern them. As such, Naoki gradually begins to transfer them from one pile to the next after checking, memorizing the order as she goes. \u201cWell,\u201d Naoki begins, \u201cwhat\u2019s your understanding of the major issues so far?\u201d As she poses the question, Naoki fixes Emahra with the most casual of measuring gazes, fishing for a bit of insight. ", "1473224000000": "With an almost excessively casual shrug, Naoki responds, \u201cIt\u2019s no trouble. We still have all of today, after all.\u201dHaving finished sorting through the folders, Naoki now begins to reorder them, taking her time in carefully pulling out each one from the stack before sliding it back in another slot. Whether there is any rhyme or reason to her reordering is unclear, but the stack is probably being sorted by some method or another. \u201cWhat had you tied up? Anything, fun?\u201dAs Naoki deploys this most offhand and clearly friendlily-intentioned inquiry in Ema\u2019s direction, Naoki\u2019s eyes turn from the folders up to lock onto hers, intending to establish and maintain eye contact, or failing that, simply observe Emahra's\u00a0visible reaction to the question.Simultaneously, Naoki reaches out to Skarlet telepathically in response to her inquiry. \u201cI\u2019m in the library with Grandma and Marshal Untyrid. We\u2019re preparing for the summit. Do you need something?\u201d", "1473291244000": "Looking on As Emahra responds, the corners of Naoki\u2019s mouth play upward into a smirk. She didn\u2019t know that elves could be that color. \u201cOh, of course.\u201d The response is flat and untempered, but Naoki\u2019s grin is anything but. She evidently finds the whole thing to be highly amusing. However, she opts to leave it there, for the time being, sliding one of the folders across the desk to Emahra. \u201cAs much as I hate to spoil the mood, I think it prudent, to begin with, this: one of the more important portions of the summit. I\u2019ll\u2026 let that speak for itself.\u201dShe gestures with one hand to the folder, as off-white and unlabeled as it is, sitting there on the desk. Within, Emahra would find Takhana\u2019s notes of Lamina\u2019s testimony. Meanwhile, Naoki responds to Skarlet telepathically,\u201cOf course, Skarlet, with the understanding that I need to finish these preparations today and as such, won\u2019t be able to spend much time chatting until afterward.\u201d\u201cAlso,\u201d Naoki continues aloud, \u201cmy daughter is coming up to stop by for a time. So when she does\u2026\" Naoki gestures to the folder with disgust, intending to imply that she shouldn\u2019t leave it open for Skarlet to read.", "1473298682000": "A slight waggle of the eyebrows hints that perhaps Naoki intends to loop back around to the topic later, but for the time being she falls silent, allowing Emahra to read in silence. After Skarlet has sat down, Naoki offers her a one-armed hug, but doesn\u2019t continue the interaction further, instead opting to peruse another one of the folders\u2019 contents which she hadn\u2019t yet spent the time to review in detail. Looking up as the woman across the table moves again, Naoki notes that Emahra is capable of some very intimidating looks. Goodness. In response to her question, Naoki intentionally chooses to take on a considerably lighter and more conversational tone, shrugging a bit as she speaks, \u201cNothing in particular, but I thought that it was something you should most definitely be aware of, both in this context and in that of mentoring Ms. Manira. I don\u2019t intend to share that information at the summit unless that... \u2018path\u2019 is ripe for the taking, as it were, but it sets the stage well for the next bit I think you ought to have a look at\u2026\u201dWithout further explanation, Naoki takes a folder off the top of the stack, the fattest of the lot, and slides it across the table. Emahra would find it to be filled primarily with raw, unfiltered information pertaining to Isra\u2019s military, its infrastructure, its capabilities, commanders, structures, and the like. With unfettered access to this information and with so many data points to measure and express, there\u2019s quite a lot of paperwork to sort through. Next, another folder is slid across the desk to join the first. It contains what information Naoki has regarding Goraia\u2019s military. The majority of it, in truth, is maps of Old Medan and information about their military, interspersed with verbatim accounts given by the group of refugees that Lord Tristian Seryl brought over. What with their closed borders policy and scrying countermeasures, collecting information has been difficult, and as such, this second folder isn't nearly as thick as its predecessor. \u201cYou have received instruction in grand strategy, as I recall. \u2026 I have not. As such, I would like to consult you, and spend an amount of time in which we contemplate the theoretical scenario in which war between Isra and Goraia is made inevitable, as well as some of the miscellaneous and general points of grand strategy. I would like to apply a rough and perhaps messy patch over this gap in my knowledge, before the summit, rather than after, and figured you the best source to draw from.\u201d The unspoken continuation goes that Naoki would rather consult Emahra over any of the various generals she could possibly squeeze the information out of. ", "1473368007000": "Naoki nods noncommittally, not having much to say on the matter of Emahra\u2019s schedule. She would probably need to sleep at some point, though. Regardless, Naoki leaves Emahra to her contemplation, continuing her idle perusal of whatever information is contained within the folder before her. Once Emahra speaks again, Naoki looks up, sliding her folder off to one side. As the plan is detailed, Naoki listens with rapt attention, occasionally interjecting with a question of her own in an attempt to both absorb the presented plan and gain a rudimentary understanding of why the plan is the way it is. Throughout the presentation, Naoki notes that while this is certainly a fairly sound-seeming plan, in matters of war such as these, being able to execute such a thing flawlessly ought to be nigh-impossible. This plan is built upon logic and assumptions- not all of which will hold true and fails to account for all sorts of variables, such as weather, for instance. However, Naoki finds herself satisfied with it. Not only is it a fair enough baseline from which to adapt from, not only is it enough to begin preparations, and not only has Naoki\u2019s understanding of grand strategy been broadened, but Emahra\u2019s presentation has proven- at least to Naoki, that she wasn\u2019t overstating her prowess, and seems to be fully capable of directing such activities- which was, in a roundabout way, Naoki\u2019s primary goal for this meeting. After Emahra has concluded her explanation, Naoki nods thoughtfully in acknowledgement before responding, \u201cYes. It would seem that way. But I\u2019m not quite as confident as you seem to be. There are too many unknowns. Our information is not recent or accurate enough. If what we\u2019ve estimated is accurate, yes, by all means, it would be a complete rout. But somehow I doubt that it would be as easy as all that.\u201dAfter thinking a moment longer, Naoki continues, \u201cI think that\u2026 if or when it ever comes down it, I would prefer to employ a more conservative strategy. But such things will remain to be seen, I suppose, and we should definitely work in cooperation with whatever allies we might have at the time to form our final strategy.\u201d All of which is quite sumptuous, Naoki supposes. However, that seems to be all she has to say on the matter for the moment. ", "1473487564000": "Nodding slightly in acknowledgement, Naoki takes Emahra\u2019s cue, standing up from her seat to initiate a similar stretching ritual. Hers, however, includes a few tail flexes. After a few moments, Naoki considers the table and its contents from her position standing above it, hands on hips. The folders that had been gathered for the meeting and ordered so precisely have since been mostly unstacked and spread across the table to represent various battalions and combat groups in the final scenario Emahra had detailed: the siege of Stonevale. Along with the folders, the ink, quills, and even a few books have found themselves into the depiction. To say the same thing in another way, the table is a mess and Naoki finds herself without the willingness or inclination to clean it or continue with summit preparations at all. The past few weeks have been nothing but summit preparations, and honestly, Naoki has had just about enough of it. With this in mind, she speaks up, addressing her friends around the table. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what. Skarlet, I have a few personal matters that I would like to speak with Marshal Untyrid. Afterwards, I think you\u2019re about due for a lesson in economics, so unless you\u2019re terribly opposed to the idea, I think we ought to get that out of the way while we both seem to have some spare time today. And then, after that...\u201d Naoki continues, tone rising to imply something of an announcement.  For a moment she pauses- building anticipation. \u201cI\u2019m going to take a nap,\u201d comes the quietly stated and perhaps disappointing conclusion. ", "1474127582000": "Naoki can\u2019t help but smirk as Emahra blushes so visibly. It reminds her, in a way, of Liz. Always so professional, so proper, bordering on prudish. Yet, as the topic of intimacy comes up, so too does the color in their cheeks and the embarrassment! The whole thing, on both women, is terribly cute, Naoki thinks. Thinking a bit further, she wonders if Emahra\u2019s squeal is quite as good as Liz\u2019, but dismisses the thought, at least for the time being. To both Skarlet and Grandma, Naoki nods her acknowledgement and responds, \u201cI\u2019ll see you both later, then.\u201dWith that, and after Grandma has left the room, Naoki stands, planting her palms on the table and nodding once more- mostly to herself, in confirmation that she\u2019s finished here for now, and is prepared to proceed. To this end, she gestures to Emahra, suggesting that she follow. Moving from the table, Naoki pats the top of Skarlet\u2019s head as she walks past, and toward the door. Out the door, and into the hallway, Naoki leads at a leisurely sort of pace, tail swaying idly, hands held behind her back. Once they\u2019ve distanced themselves somewhat from the library, Naoki turns to Emahra as they\u2019re walking, smirks, and raises her eyebrows in a wordless inquiry. A moment later, she articulates it with a slightly teasing tone, \u201cSo? \u2026 Tell me about it.\u201d", "1474199771000": "Continuing on at her leisurely pace, Naoki proceeds, not really heading toward anything, in particular, simply walking through the halls through the halls for the sake of it. As Emahra elaborates, with that silly sort of smitten smile on her face, Naoki can\u2019t help but grin herself, both pleased that Emahra is, herself, so pleased, and also finding some level of amusement in the manner in which Emahra is speaking.At the comments about how \u2018things progressed\u2019, Naoki doesn\u2019t bother to hide her chuckle but is careful not to chuckle in such a way that could easily be construed as hurtful, as that\u2019s not her intention. The mental image of Emahra\u2019s very first sexcapade is\u2026 entertaining, to say the least. If she\u2019s blushing this much speaking about it after the fact, Naoki can only imagine how she acted at the time and finds the whole event rather pleasant to consider. After it seems like her blue eared, red-faced friend is finished, Naoki responds, \u201cWell, congratulations! I\u2019m pleased that things are going so well for you; it sounds like you really enjoyed yourself last night.\u201d With this, she offers a smirk, intending to play on Emahra\u2019s embarrassment a bit.  Tilting her head to one side, she continues, \u201cWhat about him, though? What sort of man is he, and what do you like about him?\u201d", "1474294902000": "Listening on, Naoki nods thoughtfully. Silently, she notes that the majority of the sentiments and emotional concepts Emahra is expressing, she shares, to varying extents. Perhaps she\u2019s reading a bit too far into it, she muses. Or perhaps the sentiments are simply vague or general enough that a majority of individuals might relate. However, regardless of what the case may be, Naoki feels as if  she at least has a fair understanding of where Emahra is coming from. Exercising the Hug License she has been granted, Naoki stops her meandering to wrap her arms around the other woman, pulling her close and lowering her voice as not to speak too loudly into the pointed ear only a few inches from her mouth, \u201cHe sounds wonderful; I think things will work out well between the two of you.\u201d Pulling back, Naoki leaves her hands on Emahra\u2019s shoulders and continues, \u201cMaybe once things have settled down a bit, you and he and Kate and I could do some double dates, mm? That might be fun.\u201d With this, Naoki offers a lightly teasing smirk, allowing Emahra the freedom to interpret it either seriously or as a joke, as she might prefer to. ", "1474352090000": "\u201cExcellent, I\u2019ll look forward to that, then. Additionally, if you find yourself in need of someone to talk to, advice, or simply a fluffy ear to listen to your woes, you know where to find me.\u201d As she offers this service, Naoki\u2019s tone adopts a somewhat more serious, cautioning edge, intending to imply that things don\u2019t quite always turn out as one might like, and that Emahra should be prepared for a few metaphorical bumps in the road that is her upcoming relationship with Valerian. Naoki sincerely doubts that any insurmountable issues will find her favorite elf, but figures it best to remind her that such things exist regardless- what with how wonderfully naive she seems. With this caution stated, Naoki\u2019s tone lightens as she continues, \u201cI don\u2019t believe that I have anything, in particular, I need from you today, but you should be prepared for the summit tomorrow. As such, I would\u2026\u201d Pausing mid-sentence, Naoki fixes Emahara with a searching sort of look for a moment before continuing, \u201c... I haven\u2019t invited you to live up here, have I?\u201d Indeed, as one might recall, Naoki has not. \u201cMy apologies. Allow me, then, to extend this most sincere and much-belated invitation to you.\u201d With a grand, two-handed gesture to the building around them and a humorously exaggerated formal tone, she continues, \u201cI invite you to live here, at this: my house, The Chalet du Sommet Minuit, Cottage of the Midnight Mountaintop.\u201dDropping the tone, Naoki turns about on her heel and begins to tread back in the direction they came, pausing to ensure that Emahra is following before continuing, \u201cI realize that you may be spending a lot of time at Valerian\u2019s, now and that you already have a room over at Headquarters, but I offer this as an alternative. It is equally- if not more secure, and offers the same convenience of travel as the other locations, but offers a few unique services- I doubt that Valerian's Villa has as well-trained kitchen staff, for one thing. Even if you don\u2019t intend on spending every night up here, I think it would be a good idea to claim one of these rooms as your own.\u201dGesturing, Naoki and Emahra seem to have arrived at one of the Chalet\u2019s bedroom wings. Off to either side of the hallway, doors branch off at irregular intervals, some of them labeled with plaques listing the occupant\u2019s name and decorations, others are blank and apparently unused. Down at the end of the hallway, Naoki\u2019s own suite (which she shares with both Kate and Artemis) sits as the singular door occupying the far wall. Emarha would find the same system of doorknob locks utilised at The Sun Marshal Headquarters to be in use here, and each room to be highly varied in its decoration; she might need to do a bit of looking to find one that suits her taste.With her invitation stated, Naoki stands off to one side idly, waiting to see how Emahra might react. ", "1474545328000": "Standing off to one side as Emahra bounces from one room to the next, a certain phrase finds its way to the forefront of Naoki\u2019s mind. An opinion, and outlook, that was shared with Naoki almost a full year ago. Nov 11, 2015 12:07:01 GMT -8 Kate Green said:\"There are those who are born happy, then there are those who have to find their own way to happiness. I'd say that the one's that are happy should try to make others happy as well. After all, our time here is limited. Might as well use it helping people stand up since there are more than enough people who enjoy pushing them down.\"Despite the rather roundabout way it was phrased, and what else was going on as it was being stated, Naoki did indeed take special note of this outlook, and though her analytical and utilitarian sides never quite bought into the philosophy, preferring instead to maintain more nihilistic views, right here, right now, watching this woman, this elf, Emahra Untyrid- sole survivor of a dead world, refugee from another dimension, the last of her kind, with no family to speak of and enough friends to count on two fingers, bounce around so excitedly, with such joy\u2026 Naoki is forced to conclude in her ponderous sort of logical manner, that, yes, bringing others joy does indeed make her happy. At least in this instance. Unfamiliar with the feeling and unsure how to- or even if she should express it, Naoki continues to stand by somewhat awkwardly until Emahra turns to face her again. Waving a hand dismissively and flushing slightly in a clumsy attempt to navigate around Emahra\u2019s appreciation, Naoki responds, \u201cDon\u2019t worry too much about the summit- get some rest. The small details of what I have planned aren't nearly as important as you being well rested and prepared for the inevitable imbroglio tomorrow.\u201dGesturing down toward the end of the hall, Naoki continues, \u201cThat\u2019s my room. As mentioned, I\u2019m going to go spend some time with Skarlet and then have a nap. Don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to the house staff for assistance- especially in moving your items, that\u2019s what they\u2019re here for. If you need anything from me, you know how to reach me. Unless we meet before then, I\u2019ll see you here tomorrow morning.\u201dFiguring that going for another hug so soon after the last would probably be a bit more than may be welcome, Naoki instead offers Emahra a warm smile, a wave, and a nod before turning about to make her way back toward the library. ", "1475626589000": "After about a minute, the door to the room opens outward. Standing there on the threshold is Naoki herself, dressed in only a thin black negligee. Judging by the manner in which her hair is less than perfectly arranged and her tail\u2019s fur is somewhat messy, it would seem as if she has just awoken from a nap. Rubbing at her eye with one hand, Naoki raises the other in greeting, \u201cHello. To what occasion do I owe the pleasure?\u201d", "1475913152000": "As Naoki eyes the device, realization takes its sweet time in dawning on her. For a moment she stands, her gaze shifting between the jar and Grandma\u2019s face. Then it clicks, and she begins to nods slowly, backing up out of the doorframe and gesturing inward, inviting Grandma into her sitting room. Taking a seat on the longer of the two sofas, Naoki rests her arms on her knees, and listens quietly, nodding every so often. Grandma is correct, of course, and Naoki is all about precautions. Waving idly with one hand, Naoki responds, \u201cGo ahead, then.\u201d It\u2019s clear that she isn\u2019t quite all the way awake, yet. ", "1476031706000": "Nodding along quietly, Naoki looks on as Grandma speaks her bit, positions the jar, and the process begins. As the wisps begin to make contact, she shifts slightly in her seat, tail lashing, evidently somewhat uncomfortable. Sanctity of mind is a concept that Naoki holds above many others, and while this isn\u2019t quite an invasion or a manipulation, it\u2019s certainly not a wholly comfortable feeling to endure. Somewhat like having ice inside one\u2019s clothes, or an itch that cannot be scratched, but with the added \u2018fun\u2019 of dredging up all sorts of less-than-fun memories. Still, Naoki doesn\u2019t make much of a scene of it. Memories are something she deals with on a regular basis, and although this process is uncomfortable and irregular, it isn\u2019t exactly showing her anything amazingly new. It doesn\u2019t seem to be, at least. After a minute or two, she settles into a sort of holding pattern, hands folded in her lap, eyes shut, but back rigidly straight. In this position, Naoki remains until the process is complete. ", "1476556408000": "Continuing to nod along in acknowledgement, Naoki doesn't seem to have much of an issue with anything Grandma says. However, when the sleep aid is offered, she chuckles a bit and waves a dismissive hand. She wouldn't be needing that.Rising from the seat, Naoki waves half-heartedly in farewell, checks to ensure the door has closed firmly behind Grandma, and proceeds directly back to her bed. Thankfully, the process hadn't taken very long, and her spot is still warm.\u00a0", "1476556516000": "Several days later...Deep in the bowels of The Chalet, nestled in among the mess of basements, vaults, and tunnels, lies a room. The room is almost perfectly cubical, measuring about twenty meters to a side. The walls, ceiling, and floor are all of plain and largely unremarkable stone bricks, of about average size. The room has exactly one door, centered on one of the walls and seemingly made of some sort of metal- though a handful of runes are carved into its surface. It is within this room that Naoki has begun her preparations. On the right side of the room if one is standing in the doorway, a table has been brought in. A long, squat sort of table, with six sturdy legs. Atop it, a fair variety of items have been placed. Among them are assorted candles, quills, parchment, and ink, bits of chalk, bottles filled with a variety liquids- some of them glowing, a set of matches, and a few suspiciously large, phallic shaped items. Among these items, one in particular stands out, and it is a large book, a tome, even, bound in purple letter and quite thick. It sits in the center of the table, open to a page, though numerous bookmarks hang their tassels out of the top. In the center of the chamber, there is a raised dais, of the circular variety. Or perhaps it is an altar. Whatever the case may be, it seems to be made of a sort of bluish gray, and very smooth stone. The top of the platform is smooth, polished, and perhaps five meters in diameter, but the sides bear all manner of intricate runes, etchings, and depictions. Though the purpose of the runes would remain unclear to all but the finest of rune mages, the drawings and depictions interspersed throughout feature a suspicious number of lewd shapes, engaged in all sorts of activities, as well as a fair number of dark, demonic sorts of symbols. It\u2019s a bit of a strange thing to behold- almost surreal in how the content of what would otherwise be a very fine and cultured bit of art is so exceptionally lewd, and the very sheer dichotomy in texture between the top and the sides. The floor immediately around the altar is clean clear of obstructions for the time being. It is only around the very edges of the enclosure that candles seem to have been lit. Though the candles vary considerably in size, shape, and color, none of them are particularly interesting or provide anything more beyond flickering light. Additionally, it should be noted at this point that while none of the items within the room have any active magics about them at the moment, the powerful pervasive magics and wards placed upon The Chalet have been modified somewhat for this particular chamber. Notably, the wards that prevent any and all manners of magical entry to the grounds have been modified to allow only those who have been invited, just the same as the teleportation rooms. Additionally, certain other magics that would usually be all but prohibited are, in this particular chamber, permitted. Furthermore, there are a fair number of miscellaneous protective sorts of spells in place here that are not seen elsewhere, though none are active at the moment. However, the heating spell that keeps the entire complex at a toasty 76\u2109 continues to function in the chamber without Beyond those items which have already been detailed, there exists only one more item of note in the chamber, and it is Madame Naoki. Standing there completely unadorned and unclothed, with the table behind her, the altar a few feet before her, and the door off to her left, she surveys the preparations. Everything\u2026 seems to be in order. Because as it so happens, the book on the table is entitled Wes\u2019 Grand Compendium of Summoning, and was authored by legendary wizard, Wes the Wizard. And as the book says, there are all manner of parallel, alternate, and wildly alien planes of existence, and all it takes is an incredible amount of very intricate and dangerous magic to forcibly yank the denizens of one of those planes over to this plane to do one\u2019s bidding. If one follows The Wes School of Summoning\u2019s Ways, there are three major components to a summoning spell. The first is the bit that does the pulling, the abduction. It is further categorized into the bit that does the pulling, and the bit that plops whatever the creature is wherever it is that you want it, but that\u2019s irrelevant. The second portion is the bit that binds the creature to do the will of the summoner. Because oftentimes, the creatures are less than pleased to have been yanked across time and space, and would much sooner bite the summoner\u2019s head off than go perform whatever embarrassing tasks the summoner would have them. As such, some magic can be applied so that the creature has no choice in the matter. The third portion is optional, and that is the bit that one could use to apply other magics to their creature. Enchantments to make them more durable, stronger, or not prone to smelling quite so awful. However, Naoki does not follow The Wes School of Summoning\u2019s ways. Not in this instance, at least. Here, she has chosen to, rather than using a scepter of some variety to create the runes out of magic itself, to carve them into this dias. This has limited her to a very narrow window of summoning magic, and furthermore, she has only chosen to utilize the first portion of the spell, the one that does the pulling and the plopping- and at that, she hasn\u2019t even done the right sort of runes to make it an infallible spell. Where Wes the Wizard might utilize a great metaphorical hand of magic to reach across time and space to pluck whoever he might see fit from their home, Naoki instead uses a single beckoning finger and the magical equivalent of a wink and a smirk. Indeed, Naoki has bastardized Wes\u2019 noble summoning magics to make a device which essentially invites beings into this chamber. Only beings of a demonic and lusty persuasion, at that. However, with that in mind, Naoki has her sights set at the very top. This altar, with its particular configuration of carefully selected runes, is intended to summon the most powerful and lustiest demon that currently exists- whoever that may be. (Wherein the word \u2018summon\u2019 is a term used loosely, and it would really be more accurate to say that it invites them.)Of course, with all of the preparations and precautions apparently in order, there is no time like the present. Stepping up to the altar and nuding it with her foot, Naoki sets the thing into motion. (Wherein, agian, 'motion' is a term used loosely, as the altar isn\u2019t actually moving as much as the runes on it are simply glowing with magical energies.)Taking a few steps back, Naoki places a hand on her hip and watches with anticipation and a slight smirk. If this works, whoever it is ought to show up right there on the altar. ", "1476579331000": "Naoki\u2019s smirk widens as a rift in time and space forms before her on the altar. That is the other problem with this method of summoning: only beings powerful enough to traverse the planes unaided are able to answer the call. In this case, of course, it isn\u2019t an issue. As the woman steps through, Naoki exercises her Right to Ogle, looking her up and down. It\u2019s not particularly hard to surmise that this is the Demonlady\u2019s base state. Because if one was going to disguise their appearance, it wouldn\u2019t make very much sense to disguise as that. Not that her form isn\u2019t appealing- it is, but\u2026 it\u2019s also a bit off-putting. Not as efficient as it could be if one\u2019s singular goal is simply to appear as desirable. Moving her hand from her hip to meet its partner behind her back as the Demonlady begins to speak, Naoki listens quietly, rolling a bit on the balls of her feet. It\u2019s been awhile since anyone has referred to her as \u2018delectable\u2019, but Naoki doesn\u2019t seem to mind overly much. What she finds far more interesting is that the Demonlady knows her. Damn. That\u2019s how you know you\u2019ve really made it, she supposes. When you don\u2019t have to introduce yourself to anyone. Not heads of state, not anyone on the street, and not demigod lords of the underworld. However, Naoki supposes, that\u2019s to be expected. If she were her, she would know her, too, but whether keeping an eye on this plane is something that the current set of Demonlords do is a bit of information that has escaped Naoki until just now. Information pertaining to the various circles, levels, and incarnations of hell is sketchy at best, simply because there are so many varieties. For a moment, Naoki considers. Right to the chase, this one. Which is probably fitting, she supposes- she's the same way herself, most of the time. And while Naoki might have preferred to get around to her proposal in due time, Naoki supposes that there is no time like the present, especially insofar as her ever-mounting need is concerned, as may be clearly evident if the Demonlady can actually see out of those iris-less eyes she\u2019s got, there.\u201cWell,\u201d she begins, \u201cbeyond the obvious, I would like to explore the possibility of an arrangement.\u201d She pauses, intending to make clear that the sort of arrangement she has in mind ought to be far from standard. \u201cYou gain power from the lust of mortals in some roundabout way,  yes?\u201d", "1476592735000": "Evidently amused to see the Demonlady\u2019s eyebrows raise, she responds, \u201cWell, I can\u2019t imagine most mortals are very creative, either.\u201d Outwardly, Naoki doesn\u2019t seem particularly phased as the Demonlady approaches, but the veritable feast she\u2019s treating the demon to cannot be hidden by body language. Neither can involuntary responses of the body, for that matter. Eyeing the tentacle that hovers so close, Naoki employs a fair bit of restraint as she considers. The way the Demonlady stated it, it would seem as if feeding of arousal is a more personal and very distinct affair from the second bit- the acts powering her realm. Hm. Figuring it best to continue proceedings directly, Naoki continues, \u201cMy idea is more or less as such... Whatever methods you use to harvest these things- the arousal and lustful acts and such, they must be somewhat passive. Because if you\u2019re to profit in some way from any instance in which any mortals get it on, that must be a very wide area sort of spell, to say the very least. And likewise, I assume that you may only feed on arousal if you\u2019re\u2026 close to the individual in question.\u201d With this, Naoki tilts her head back and slightly to the side, intending to meet the other woman\u2019s gaze and to draw attention to the fact that the lady is in awfully close physical proximity to her, and seems to be enjoying it more than most others tend to.  \u201cIn both cases, I think that an increase in efficiency is possible. I\u2019ve been dabbling in artifice, and the high magics of energy manipulation, as you can see.\u201d With one hand, Naoki gestures idly toward the altar in the center of the room, a primary example. \u201cIt may be possible to devise some manner of device, or, rune spell that gives you more bang for my banging, if you would be interested in such a thing.\u201dWith her offer on the metaphorical table, Naoki does her best to simply stay put and maintain eye contact, despite how much she would love to not.", "1476718874000": "As Lust steps away, Naoki heaves a visible sigh of relief. A second longer and she would have lost all pretense of restraint. As Cahryss presents her rear, Naoki clasps one hand firmly in the other to keep it from wandering. As she clears her head and parses what the Demonlady said, Naoki wonders for a moment what all she possibly could do to earn this woman\u2019s ire. Any agreement they enter into would have to be accepted by both parties, and it seems like it would be simple enough to simply understand and decline. It isn\u2019t as if Naoki has a great ability to force her will on Lust. Perhaps she\u2019s been double-crossed before, Naoki muses. Hellscape politics are a bit hectic, as she understands, and this sort of suspicion seems understandable. Regardless, Naoki responds, \u201cWell, truthfully, I don\u2019t know much about you, your circle of the hellscape, your magics, or what all you could offer me. I initiated this discussion with the assumption that we, as two individuals who could probably stand to profit from the other, could work something out that we both find to be mutually agreeable.\u201d With this, Naoki offers a small shrug. It is the truth, but not quite all of it. If Cahryss\u2019 abilities to sense intentions are particularly keen, she might postulate that Naoki has something in mind, but has chosen not to voice it- perhaps in the interest of not coming off as presumptuous. ", "1476736611000": "Raising her hands in mock surrender, Naoki concedes, equally as eager to proceed to the next portion of their meeting. \u201cVery well. If you\u2019ve been keeping as close an eye on me as it would seem, you ought to know: I envy very few individuals. However\u2026 my physiology and supernatural ability as they relate to sensuality\u2026 I often find lacking. Or at least somewhat ordinary.\u201d Gesturing to herself, Naoki intends to illustrate that in regards to beyond her tail (which is excellent for foreplay and cuddling but not much else) she is all but a perfectly mundane human being- her other exceptionalities notwithstanding. \u201cTo elaborate, I crave variety. There is only so much I am capable of with the tools I currently possess, and I\u2019m looking for a little something\u2026 extra.\u201d With this, Naoki raises her eyebrows, treats Cahryss to one of her trademark smirks, and eyes the writing mass of tentacles pointedly.", "1476777568000": "Nodding along as much as she\u2019s able between shudders, Naoki is in clear agreement: something like those would be excellent. Preferably, in her right now. But then Lust draws away, leaving Naoki unfinished and somewhat disappointed, if in a clearer state of mind. In this more astute state, Naoki consciously realizes what Lust has done- completely halting her advance as she states her terms of the deal, as to allow Naoki to seriously consider. This action, Naoki was not at all expecting and speaks favorably of the Demonlady\u2019s character. She is either a legitimately decent individual (the demon bits notwithstanding) or knows not to try to fool with Naoki. Whatever the case may be, Naoki appreciates it and listens carefully as Lust outlines her terms. Nodding along quietly in acknowledgment and contemplation, it only takes a half-moment before Naoki- rather than accepting the offered hand, raises a single finger in objection, \u201cNot quite. I would like a few clarifications and caveats added before I agree.\u201dBeginning, Naoki adopts her business tone- apparently able to shift from being molested by tentacles to levelheaded negotiation quite easily. \u201cI have no issue with the first two terms. I honestly intended to invite you to parties anyway, and as so long as your funneling magics have no detrimental side-effects, I will happily accept them. However, in regards to the third term, I would like some clarification on what all that entails. I\u2019m not particularly interested in my soul becoming anyone\u2019s property, per say, but the prospect of \u2018partners\u2019 is an attractive one. As I am not very well informed on how souls and such are handled down there, I would like clarification on what specifically you mean by that.\u201dEven though it seems that Naoki has more to say about the agreement, she pauses here. It would be best to work out the terms Lust has already presented before beginning to tack on supplementary terms, she figures.", "1476938208000": "Continuing to listen carefully, Naoki nods slowly in acknowledgment but doesn\u2019t immediately express agreement. Though the offer is very clearly a generous one, there is much to be considered. Truthfully, Naoki hasn\u2019t done very much thinking about the \u2018afterlife\u2019, more concerned with what would happen in her absence than what she would do once she\u2019s gone. Contingency plans, successors, wills, and such. But as for what to do with her soul\u2026 Well, the question sort of begs itself, she supposes. Because while Naoki is very firmly opposed to \u2018mortal\u2019 immortality of the sort that vampires have, the soul is sort of immortal by default, she supposes. Which makes things a bit troublesome- in that her options are limited. The first option is to accept Lust\u2019s offer, and do as she suggests. Which is a very attractive concept, Naoki thinks. There\u2019s something to be said not only for the experience of it- spending eternity in neverending throes of pleasure with those who do it best but also for the security of it. Knowing her own soul to be a fairly valuable one- and being all but certain that it has dramatically increased in value since it was last appraised, the possibility of some manner of gluttony demon or another soul-eating or collecting creature eating her soul is quite high- if she doesn\u2019t take steps to protect it. Hence the attractiveness of Lust\u2019s offer. Once promised, Naoki would presumably need to take no further action after death to ensure the safety of her soul, Lust here would simply come and take it. But then again, so could anyone else. So could Grandma, or so could Ms. Lum, for that matter. And considering the resources at her disposal, it would be fairly trivial for Naoki to have her soul forcibly reincarnated into a new body of her choosing. But then that\u2019s immortality, isn\u2019t it. Is it really without the mind, though? It\u2019s hard to say- that\u2019s a question about the relationship of the mind and the soul, and those are always tricky. But beyond that, what of everyone else? Though Naoki supposes she won\u2019t really have any problems in accounting for Artemis and Skarlet\u2019s afterlives- as there likely won\u2019t be any, what of Kate\u2019s? Or Liz\u2019, Jun\u2019s, or Emahra\u2019s, for that matter? Thinking to herself quite frankly, Naoki muses that if she\u2019s going to spend eternity with anyone, she would really prefer to spend it with someone she loves rather than Tentacles over here. But accepting the offer would put her in a pretty reasonable position to negotiate for that- for their souls as well, she supposes. And really, Naoki doesn't think that Kate would much object to that sort of afterlife. However, if Naoki doesn\u2019t accept the offer, she could probably also go about achieving the same thing in another way. There\u2019s nothing in particular besides convention that says that one\u2019s soul needs to either go up and down, and those forces can be circumvented by people like Grandma anyway\u2026 These sorts of spiraling questions, doubts, and wildly out of control trains of thought are the sort that plague Naoki as she takes a few steps over to the altar and seats herself upon it, finding her legs just barely long enough such so that her feet brush against the floor, but cannot rest properly on it. At least it\u2019s warm, she supposes. For the space of a few moments, she simply sits in deep concentration, staring into one of the candles, watching it flicker and waver slightly as candles tend to even in the absence of a breeze. Presently, however, she begins her response, slowly and ponderously, choosing each word carefully. \u201cWell. Allow me first to state that I am flattered by your offer. I believe that I have a handle on the\u2026\u201d With one hand, Naoki gesticulates idly as she searches for the word. \u201cThe significance- the gravity of what you\u2019re offering me, and honestly, it\u2019s a bit strange to receive such an offer from someone I\u2019ve only met in the past\u2026 what, ten, fifteen minutes? And who hasn\u2019t quite introduced themselves beyond their title. Not that I mean to imply anything about your manners, or my opinion of you so far- it\u2019s just that I\u2019m surprised that I\u2019ve made such an impression that you would offer something like that to me.\u201d This, Naoki offers in a light yet polite sort of tone, not intending to come off as rude or upset. \u201cFurthermore,\u201d she continues, \u201cI\u2019m beginning to have second thoughts about dying in the traditional sense at all- I might, later in life, decide to simply not, and continue to accrue power in my own right. The semantics on that might get a bit strange if I utilize some means of resurrection, so allow me to make this counter proposal.\u201dSliding down off the altar, Naoki turns to face her guest directly\u00a0and puts her business voice back on to continue,\u00a0\u201cI will accept that third proposed term with the following condition. If I might like to stay up here in the overworld for a while longer than may be considered \u2018fair\u2019, by whatever means I may choose to employ, you will allow me to, and will not attempt by any means to secure my soul before I am prepared to surrender it. However, as I suspect will be the case, I die- regularly, in the traditional sense, and opt to stay dead, my soul will be yours to do as you propose. Furthermore, I would feel a bit more comfortable if it is written explicitly into the contract that there will be no involuntary servitude involved.\u201d", "1477081935000": "Listening to the Demonlady\u2019s response, Naoki smiles slightly. Honestly, she had expected Maelik to be something of a fluke, and \tother demons to be considerably\u2026 ruder, and less agreeable. And- she supposes, they probably are, for the most part. But even so.\u00a0Waving a hand dismissively, Naoki shrugs. \u201cMeh. If you wouldn\u2019t prefer to, I\u2019m not going to insist. It\u2019s just somewhat troublesome not to have a name to address you with. I could call you \u2018The Demonlady of Lust\u2019 but then that\u2019s referring to you in the third person, and by a title that\u2019s somewhat similar to my own. Just \u2018Lust\u2019 is a noun, and that would get troublesome if either of us wanted to use the noun in conversation- and I expect that we will. I think that if you wouldn\u2019t prefer to tell me, you should at least adopt a nickname for convenience. Especially so if you intend to conduct more business in the mortal realm here, and would like to keep your identity hidden.\u201d", "1477290225000": "Naoki looks on as the wicks of the candles tremble under the power associated with the name. Beyond nodding solemnly, Naoki offers no further comment. It\u2019s mildly amusing, though, she muses. Idly, she wonders if the name magic comes with the other powers Charyss possesses, or if something deliberate needs to be done to \u2018initiate\u2019 the name magic, as it were. Thinking a bit further, Naoki supposes that it must be an unintended side effect, considering that it\u2019s hardly something one would want- to give others power over them. But then at that point, what constitutes a \u2018true\u2019 name? Aren\u2019t all names given or assumed, by their nature? Or do demons have some specific naming convention, courtesy of some higher power? That would be somewhat fiddly with mortals becoming demons, though. Well, at least \u2018Naoki\u2019 is an explicitly assumed name, which is somewhat convenient, she supposes. But in any case, as nice as it is to know Charyss\u2019 name, and to have that degree of leverage, it still doesn\u2019t quite solve the issue, Naoki muses. She still can\u2019t use that name to refer to Charyss for conversational purposes, which was why she asked for the name in the first place.\u2018But that can be readdressed later\u2019, says the growing sense of need between Naoki\u2019s legs. \u2018There are altogether too many words coming out, and not enough tentacles going in!\u2019, it says. Unfortunately, the gap between Naoki\u2019s legs is not very well versed in economics and is prone to creating trade gaps. But it also seems to be yelling more loudly than the rational bits of Naoki, so it seems to be calling the shots in this case.Though there are a few lingering stipulations drifting about regarding the wording of the document and Naoki\u2019s entry into the political realm of the Hellscape, they can also be addressed later, declare The Loins. Against its better judgment, Naoki\u2019s head shakes, indicating the negative. \u201cThere are a few items I would like to discuss later, but the emphasis is on \u2018later\u2019\u201d Perhaps as eager to seal the deal as Charyss is, Naoki drips her way over to the table, and proceeds to unceremoniously slide Wes\u2019 Grand Compendium of Summoning off to one side, clearing room for the written portion of the partnership about to be forged. If Charyss would like to use the provided materials, a fine set of writing utensils and paper still stands at the ready on the left of the desk. If not, she would find herself able to freely draw upon whatever manner of magic she might wish to utilize to conjure writing materials of her own. ", "1477370449000": "Though she is somewhat surprised to see the contract simply spring into existence- that\u2019s quite the skill, she sets right about reading it, The Loins being quiet enough to allow her that. Gaze flicking from line to line, everything\u2026 seems to be in order. Nodding quietly to herself, Naoki finds nothing objectionable. Reaching over the contract, Naoki plucks one of the quills she prepared from among its fellows, dips it in the ink bottle, and takes it to the designated line. Seeing as how the two spots for signatures aren\u2019t labeled, Naoki signs her name on the upper of the two, slowly and deliberately. With that done, she nods to herself, sets the quill off to one side, and picks up the knife in her right hand. She takes a moment to examine it, turning it this way and that to see it from different angles. She then raises her left hand, extends her index finger, and while holding the knife steady, touches the pad of her index finger to the blade. Quickly, blood begins to well up on her finger, and she holds it above the designated circle, causing a single drop of blood to drip down into it. Seeing as how she seems to have satisfactorily signed her portion of the document, Naoki takes a large step to her left, allowing Charyss to take her place and sign it herself. ", "1477470438000": "Several hours later, after riding the aftershocks back down into a semi-coherent state, Naoki finds herself lying on her side atop the altar, feeling more thoroughly satiated than she has been in ages. That, and also a bit strange. Because in addition to all of the appendages she usually has, Naoki is also sporting two decidedly new, and non-standard ones- both of them long, black, and more than slightly sticky. As one might expect, it\u2019s a very alien sort of sensation, to have more appendages than one is used to, but bearing in mind the context, and functions of the appendages, it wasn\u2019t a wholly unpleasant experience, she thinks. In fact, she\u2019s rather looking forward to the next opportunity she will have to exercise them, whatever or whenever that might be.However, for the time being, enough is enough. Wouldn\u2019t want to get too sore, after all. Exercising the magics granted to her though the new tattoo on her inner thigh, Naoki wills her physiology back to the way it was, hoping that it will be alright to ride hard and put away wet, as it were in a more literal sense than usual. Though it is somewhat difficult, she is successful, causing her extra appendages to- over the course of a minute or so, shorten and melt into her skin- without leaving so much as a blemish. After checking to ensure that everything is where it ought to be, Naoki smirks a bit to herself, evidently quite pleased. Though she hasn\u2019t mastered this new ability yet, Naoki is both very satisfied with it and impressed that Cahryss was willing and able to grant it to her. She honestly thought it beyond the scope of feasibility to be granted such an ability as this and would have happily settled simply for some manner of glamour or gender manipulation magic. Yet, it was not. Sitting up, Naoki swings her legs off the side of the altar, sporting a silly sort of lopsided smirk. Turning her head to one side, Naoki looks to Cahryss, intending to eyeball and assess her newest partner- to see if she is as satisfied as she is. ", "1477524509000": "Looking on, Naoki quirks an eyebrow upward, not quite sure what all Charyss is doing. For a half-moment, she suspects some manner of trickery, but then Blinking right back, Naoki is entirely unsure what to think. When a \u2018demonic companion\u2019 was mentioned, mental images of stereotypical incubus came to mind. Six feet tall, reddish skin, chiseled abdomen, with a tongue like a snake\u2019s, wings like a bat, and hung like @maelik. But no. Scooting a bit closer, Naoki examines the creature presented to her. It\u2019s hardly larger than her fist! But it\u2019s also adorable\u2026 As Fornilan raises one tentacle to wave and chirps at her, any reservations Naoki may have had disappear. \u201cAww, look at you!\u201d Extending her arm, Naoki offers her upturned palm, holding it close enough such that Fornilan ought to be able to hop or undulate their way onto it fairly easily. Holding her other hand up as if to shake a tentacle,  she continues, \u201cIt is my pleasure to meet you, Forni. I am Naoki.\u201d", "1477558803000": "As Charyss offers her goodbyes and moves to depart, Naoki offers her a wave with her free hand and turns her attention away from Forni for a moment to take another nice, looong look at Charyss\u2019 backside before it disappears through the portal. Afterward, she returns her attention to the rascal in her hand and looks on silently as he scoots his way up her arm, and up onto her shoulder.  As he nuzzles up into the side of her head, he earns a small smile. He\u2019s an interesting little sort of thing, she thinks. Surprisingly affectionate- and articulate, for a being created for the sole purpose of- and indeed named after fornication. As his tentacles inflate, Naoki\u2019s smile shifts to a small \u2018o\u2019 shape of surprise and realization. \u2018To serve any function,\u2019 indeed. \u201cI\u2019m sure you will,\u201d she responds, raising her opposite hand to rub at the top of his head. \u201cFor now, though, come with me, I need to get clean. \u2026 And so do you, probably.\u201d Goodness only knows where he was prior to being summoned, and Naoki isn\u2019t quite looking to contract any demonic diseases. With that, Naoki takes to her feet, albeit a bit unsteadily. Figuring that Forni shouldn\u2019t have any trouble at all staying on his perch, Naoki takes a moment to survey the room- and the mess she\u2019s made of it, before dismissing the matter as a problem for later and moving to the door. Through the door and toward the stairs leading back up into the Chalet proper, Naoki proceeds, bowlegged, intending to walk directly to the nearest reasonable washroom. ", "1477655559000": "On their way through the basement hallway, there wasn\u2019t too much to see. Lots of stone, lots of large, closed doors, and a few visible glyphs. Truth be told, the majority of The Chalet\u2019s inner workings and protective magics are centered down here, locked securely away. Those, as well as numerous vaults, workshops, and other rooms that wouldn\u2019t be suitable to have anywhere above. However, once up the steps and through the thick door leading downward, things brighten up considerably. They seem to have emerged into a large hallway, wide enough for perhaps five persons to walk side by side comfortably. The floor is done in polished wood and mostly covered by a crimson carpet running down the center of the hall. Warm lighting is provided by chandeliers, which shines downward onto the occasional painting, potted plant, and bits of bric-\u00e0-brac placed on tables. Taking a right, Naoki walks swiftly along the edge of the hallway, such so that as she drips, she doesn\u2019t drip onto the carpet, but rather the wood. Luckily enough, it isn\u2019t very far, and Naoki doesn\u2019t encounter anyone along the way. Not that anyone could reasonably question or chastise her- and there aren\u2019t any children about, but it would still be somewhat awkward to explain why she\u2019s running about naked, covered in bodily fluids, with a tentacle demon on her shoulder.As it turns out, the nearest bath is one of the larger ones. That is to say, it\u2019s a massive and luxurious marble affair, centered around a central, circular basin embedded into the floor that could probably seat twenty comfortably. In addition to the restroom off to one side, the room also features a few cabinets, some pegs- presumably for hanging clothing on, and a secondary basin, off to the left of the first and roughly a quarter of the size. It is this secondary tub that Naoki approaches, and carefully crouches beside. Next to the edge, a few palm-sized black stones are placed in stark contrast to the pale white marble. Upon each stone, symbols have been carved. After taking a moment to study the symbols, Naoki places her palm on one of them, and waits for a moment. A few moments later, the very same glyph appears on the bottom of the tub, and begins to glow. A second later, Naoki and Forni are buffeted by a sudden wave of heat, seemingly emanating from what must be some manner of heating rune. Stating the obvious, Naoki narrates to Forni, \u201cOops- that\u2019s the heat.\u201dMoving her hand to another one of the black stones, Naoki glances up to the tub. This time, water begins to flow in from two points high on the walls where before, no spout was visible. Nodding slightly to herself, Naoki seems satisfied. Based on how quickly it seems to be filling, it will take the tub a few minutes before it\u2019s suitable to enter. With this in mind, Naoki seats herself on the edge- careful not to press any of the stones with her behind, with her legs dangling down into the basin. Without much more to do until the tub fills, she turns her attention to Forni. \u201cFornilan, hm?...\u201d She trails off, eyeing him. \u201cI suppose you feed on lust? What\u2019s that like, feeding on a feeling?\u201d", "1477684411000": "As Forni works his way downward, he would presumably cross over Naoki\u2019s stomach, trailing his little tentacles all the way down her midriff and side. As he does, Naoki\u2019s breath catches in her throat, her tail- which had been lying idle, lashes upward, and the entirety of her body twitches as if to toss Forni off, but she\u2019s able to control herself beyond that. After he moves past the stomach, she relaxes somewhat and shudders a sigh of relief as she listens to his response to her question. As soon as she\u2019s finished, however, Naoki cuts back in, \u201cAlright, that\u2019s all very well, but we\u2019re going to digress here for just a moment. For this to be a healthy, mutually agreeable relationship, we\u2019re going to set up some rules and guidelines so that we both get what we want, and aren\u2019t displeased in the process. By that, I mean that I\u2019m going to give you rules, and if you\u2019d like something, or would like to set a rule or guideline for me, you\u2019ll ask, and I will do my best to accommodate. Seem reasonable?\u201d Evidently, her question was rhetorical, because Naoki immediately goes on to brandish a single, very sternly pointed finger in Forni\u2019s direction as she states, \u201cYour first rule is no tickling.\u201d After delivering that point somewhat strongly, Naoki takes a deep breath, removes the edge from her tone, and continues, still brandishing the finger, but moreso now for emphasis rather than for intimidation. \u201cDo not tickle me unless I explicitly request that you do so. \u2026 And I will. I appreciate an uncontrollable fit of orgasmic laugher on occasion. \u2026 But outside of those specifically designated instances, I do not appreciate being tickled, and you should endeavor to avoid it whenever possible, in all situations. Other sorts of uninvited caressing, rubbing, or molesting... you could probably get away with- but not tickling. Got it?\u201d Quirking an eyebrow and planting a hand on her hip, Naoki does her best to study Forni\u2019s face, attempting to figure if she came off too strong or not. The intention was to be firm, but not so firm as to be oppressive or seem angry, but in cases such as these, wherein the individual in question is presumably the equivalent of a demon child, Naoki isn\u2019t entirely sure that her intentions will translate well.", "1477761673000": "Shaking her head to indicate the negative, Naoki eyes Fornilan, still somewhat puzzled. In listening, Naoki\u2019s mouth has formed the sort of very straight, somewhat strained expression one makes when trying not to smile, because as amused as they are, they\u2019re still attempting to maintain some pretense of seriousness.\u201cNo\u2026 I don\u2019t have any more rules for now, but if you have something that you\u2019d like me to do, either now or at some other time, say so.\u201dAs they\u2019ve been chatting, the tub seems to have filled up to a satisfactory level. Leaning over to one side, Naoki presses her palm to the appropriate stone to stop it filling, and nods- mostly to herself. However, before she can enter, there is one other matter. Naoki doesn\u2019t quite imagine that they have swimming pools in the hellscape. If Forni has ever swum in anything, she thinks it would have probably been a bodily fluid of some variety. For how small he is, and if one would like to correlate size and age, he may have very little experience dealing with the world in general, and may have to be taught how to swim.\u00a0Yet, he also apparently possesses\u00a0a fairly strong grasp of the common language, so making assumptions about his age probably isn't wise.\u00a0Regardless, Naoki thinks that before she dunks him, it would probably be prudent to check, at least. Raising an eyebrow toward Forni, Naoki voices her inquiry, highly unsure, \u201cDo you\u2026 swim? \u2026 Have you swum? Do your tentacles even work for swimming...?\u201d ", "1477842551000": "Nodding along in very obvious and strong agreement, Naoki doesn\u2019t seem to have any issue with Forni\u2019s request; it goes without saying as far as she\u2019s concerned. Generally speaking, she would not tolerate anyone being thrown against walls in her presence, and especially not someone as cute as Forni. Looking on as Forni splashes about, Naoki reflects that as far as demons go, Forni is awfully endearing. More so than Naoki\u2019s experiences with fairies- easily, and they\u2019re supposed to be \u2018better\u2019. Smiling slightly, she spends a few moments considering if the stigmata placed on demons is entirely unwarranted, if she\u2019s had the luck to only encounter the pleasant ones, or if she is simply the sort of person who gets on well with demons. Of those three possibilities, Naoki isn\u2019t quite sure which one she would prefer to be true.But in any case, Forni can and is swimming, which leaves Naoki without any good reason not to scoot off the edge and slide down into the tub proper, shuddering a bit as she adjusts to the high temperature. Bending at the waist, she slides further down into the water until she\u2019s submerged to the chin. In this position, she remains for a moment, simply enjoying the sensation, and the heat; there aren\u2019t many things one can do to feel quite as warm as being all but submerged in hot water. For a moment, she considers lobbing another question at Forni, but, watching as he splashes about, clearly enjoying himself, Naoki opts to wait. There will be plenty of time to rail him with questions later. For now, she is content to relax. ", "1477873022000": "Sitting quietly, Naoki remains more or less motionless and completely silent for a few minutes. Of all of the words that can be used to describe the experience that is sex with The Demonlady of Lust, \u2018tiring\u2019 is certainly one of them, and if not for Forni exiting the tub, she may have nodded off. However, as he does, she looks up, straightening a bit and turning her head to follow his journey across the floor. He would find the cloth and soap easily enough in the cabinets lining one wall, along with a wardrobe of bathrobes and a fair variety of assorted bathing accessories- brushes, towels, even a bit of pumice. Looking on curiously, Naoki muses that it\u2019s somewhat amusing- the manner in which he manipulates the objects. Tentacles are certainly the most versatile sort of limb, three in one. As his intentions become clear, Naoki first reflects that the sort of tub she\u2019s chosen isn\u2019t actually particularly conductive to actually cleaning one\u2019s self. The depth of it makes it difficult to rest one\u2019s leg up against the other side, and there aren\u2019t any options for moving water. As something of an afterthought, she entertains for a moment the notion of dissuading him but dismisses it. If he\u2019s around to take care of her- and he seems willing enough to start without being prompted, there\u2019s probably not any harm in letting him continue. She does do what she can to make it easy, however. Lifting and separating her legs as appropriate, standing, and eventually rolling over to rest her crossed arms on the edge of the tub as he presumably gets far enough to need to access her back. Throughout the course of it, he wouldn\u2019t note any unusual areas of ticklishness. The bottoms of the feet, the stomach and lower chest, and the armpits- nothing out of the ordinary in that sense, it would seem to be only her reaction that is exaggerated. ", "1477875848000": "Though Naoki can\u2019t quirk an eyebrow at him, per say- considering that he\u2019s directly behind her, an eyebrow is quirked regardless, and she waits for a moment to consider before answering, \u201cMhmm. Probably, if you stick around for any length of time.\u201dAfter another moment, she elaborates, her tone just slightly forlorn, \u201cNot tonight, though. She\u2019s not here tonight; she doesn\u2019t tend to sleep here, much to my disappointment.\u201dAfter allowing that statement to hang for a moment, she turns her head to consider him as he washes himself, and files an inquiry of her own, \u201cHow much else have you been told? I intended to tell you everything there is to know after bathing, but if you\u2019re aware of everything Charyss seems to be, that would be sort of redundant.\u201d", "1477950041000": "\u201cHmmh. Alright.\u201dFor the space of a few moments, Naoki simply sits there in the tub, blinking back at Forni. Presently, she stands, stretching as water drips off her, back into the tub. One thing that ought to be noted at this point is that though she was submerged to the chin, it was only to the chin. The top of her head is bone-dry, as is the portions of her hair not long enough to be in the water. For another moment, she seems to consider. To do the hair properly, or to not. After an amount of consideration, she concludes that she\u2019s far too lazy to do that now. With this in mind, she steps up out of the tub, apparently finished. On her way past, she takes a moment to step on one of the runestones in the floor, causing the water level in the basin to begin to slowly drop as it is drained away by some unknown mechanism of magic. Stepping carefully across the floor toward the cabinets, Naoki raises her voice slightly such so that Forni would be able to hear clearly as she begins, \u201cWell. \u2026 Her name is Kate. Kate Green. She\u2019s a bit shorter than I am, but not by too much.\u201d Having reached the cabinets, she begins to putter about in search of a towel. Evidently, she isn\u2019t particularly familiar with the specifics of this particular bathroom. As she\u2019s searching, she continues, \u201cShe\u2019s leaner than I am, though, slimmer, and more toned.  She\u2019s made a passion and a career out of gardening, so her build reflects that. Her hair is a sort of pinkish white or silver color, not unlike the color of a lotus\u2026.\u201d Silently, Naoki supposes that Forni may not quite know what a lotus is, so that may not have been the best comparison to make, but she continues regardless, \u201c...and falls down around her shoulders in big wavy curls. In an interesting coincidence, her eyes are almost just like mine, very nearly the same color\u2026 prettier, though.\u201dHaving located a suitable towel, Naoki seats herself on a bench presumably placed for just such a purpose and begins to dry herself. \u201cBeyond that, she always seems to be smiling. Always cheerful, perpetually optimistic. It\u2019s infectious, too, whenever she\u2019s around, I can\u2019t help but feel happy myself. \u2026 Though, that may just be because I love her.\u201d With a small shrug, Naoki proceeds about the process of drying herself, and once finished would return to the cabinets, seeking something to wear.  ", "1478031887000": "\u201cMmmm\u2026\u201d Naoki shrugs noncommittally as she locates and begins to put on a bathrobe from the cabinet.\u201cShe\u2019s seen scarier than you, though,\" she adresses Forni over her shoulder, \"I used to own a tavern- I still do, I used to own and manage a tavern. And for a time- believe it or not, I had a Demonlord as my head chef.\u201dFollowing Forni\u2019s initial reaction, Naoki would continue, \u201cHe was the Then-Demonlord of Wrath, Maelik. When he wasn\u2019t disguised, he was massive! Fourteen feet tall, very draconic, terribly intimidating.\u201d\u201cIt was somewhat strange, because one would expect him to be a very angry sort of individual. What with the whole Wrath bit, and the manner in which his eyes were alight with the fires of hell. ... Or at least, failing that, one would expect him to be not as much of a gentleman as he was. To this day, I have yet to meet as well mannered an individual. He was always very polite, very courteous- at least to me, and never got particularly angry in public. For one so intrinsically related to anger, I still don\u2019t know how he managed to control himself as well as he did.\u201dAs she\u2019s speaking, Naoki takes a half-step over to the counter Forni is sitting on, and extends her arm to place her hand, palm up, on the surface. With a beckoning motion of her fingers, Naoki suggests that Forni slide his way over onto her hand. From there, he would be free and able to scoot up her arm to the shoulder, or wherever else he might please to scoot to. If he opts simply to sit on her hand, she would bend her elbow to hold him at her side.\u201cBut I digress. Mr. Maelik cooked for Kate and me on numerous occasions and had a habit of sticking around to watch people take the first bite- that was his favorite part. And though it was a bit awkward the first time they met, Kate didn\u2019t have much of an issue with him after a few meals, so I doubt she would have much of an issue with you.\u201dWith that final word, Naoki would- if it is convenient to do so, give Forni a lightly teasing nudge, or some equivalent thereof. Regardless, she would, assuming that Forni is somewhere on her person, move to exit the bathroom, taking a right out into the hall at a leisurely pace. ", "1478190682000": "At Forni\u2019s apparent amazement, Naoki smirks. She certainly did know Maelik, but she decides to save that story for later. Instead, she addresses his response,\u00a0\u201cAbout that... Allow me to digress for a moment to give you context for a request of mine. Up here in this portion of the overworld, we have nations. A solid handful of them, really. Some larger or more powerful than others, with various structures of government and policies and such.\u201dAs she continues, Naoki begins to wave her right hand about idly to provide accentuation. \u201cAs it so happens, a year and some ago, I was elected as High Lady of Isra. Isra being a nation founded on principles of liberty and personal freedom, and 'High Lady' being equivalent to 'High Lord', the highest office.\u201dIn reality, there\u2019s a bit more to it than that, such as the distinction that she was elected simply as Lady and the High bit came later, but such details aren\u2019t relevant at the moment and can be clarified later if need be. \u201cAs such, I\u2019m a bit of a public figure. So if you and I are going to associate as closely as I think we both intend to, I would like to ask that you refrain from forcing yourself upon anyone, speaking generally.\u201d With this request made, she turns her head slightly to watch his response carefully, unsure of  how he might take to such a request. ", "1478219312000": "\u201cHmmh. Alright.\u201d Naoki finds Forni\u2019s response somewhat surprising. She had expected some manner of retort, or at least a more begrudging acceptance. As she understands, beings like Forni make their existence off forcing themselves on lone female adventurers as they explore dark and musty caves and such. But then, perhaps it\u2019s like bears, in that though they may have a reputation for eating people, in reality, they only attack when threatened or exceptionally hungry. At some point, she resolves to have Forni clearly explain these sorts of things, but until then, she doesn\u2019t think it will be too difficult to keep his appetite stated herself. However, further discussion is precluded as they arrive at Naoki\u2019s destination. Down at the end of a somewhat lengthy corridor of bedrooms, a single, wide door sits alone on the far wall. As Naoki approaches, her earring glimmers slightly, and the door opens outward of its own accord. However, before it does, Forni may be able to read the plaque on the door: Artemis, Kate & NaokiAs Naoki proceeds inward, Forni would find himself in a large room\u2026Feb 26, 2016 20:05:18 GMT -8 Artemis said:The door opens\u00a0 into a large room with a high vaulted ceiling. A freestanding fireplace and multiple couches, chairs, and tables furnish the room; thick fur rugs line the floor in strategic places. The hues of the oak and cedar boards paneling the room are darker than in the rest of the chalet, but lighter by several shades than the mahogany and dark oak scheme of the Midnight Sun. The walls are tastefully adorned with paintings. In one corner of the room sits an unusual furnishing - a tree. A quarter of the top portion of a mighty oak, where the branches start, has been felled, trimmed, treated, and placed in the corner. Thick limbs, stripped of bark and cured, run into the room, rising and spreading to meet the angles of the ceiling, where they are continued in a masterful mural depicting a view of the night sky from under a bare-limbed tree. Several forks and some of the more horizontal branches look like they would be particularly well suited to sitting on. Small magical lamps hang on strings draped among the branches, glowing and twinkling like little stars.There are five doors in the walls of this central room - three on the left wall, as viewed from the door, one on the right, and one on the far wall. The door in the right wall leads to the study. A line of windows along the far wall overlooks the lake and lets natural light into the room. Under the windows and continuing around the left wall of the room runs a single desk, books littered sporadically on its surface. The proper home of those books is with many of their fellows on the set of bookshelves running part of the right wall, next to a set of organizer shelves and boxes. A circular stand-alone fireplace occupies the middle of the room, along with several exceptionally comfortable-looking armchairs, two circular tables, and dark red upholstered chairs to go with them. Luxurious carpet covers the floor. The whole atmosphere is cozy and inviting, the perfect place to curl up with a book and watch the snow fall outside.The door in the far end of the common room leads to the bedroom, which is dominated by a large four-poster bed, hung with red velvet curtains, that could easily fit four people. In the middle of the back wall, a large bay window, the shelf of which is large enough to sit in comfortably, provides a stunning panoramic view of the mountains, forest, and lake. The window is flanked on either side by a small fireplace flattening the corner of the room. The rich carpet from the study is duplicated in the bedroom. Paintings of various sizes adorn the walls, with the exception of one conspicuously bare spot. A small bookshelf, a table and two chairs, a wardrobe, and a dresser complete the room\u2019s furnishings. A door in the right wall of the bedroom leads to the bathroom. Done primarily in blue slate with dark paneled walls, the main feature of the bathroom is a tub that\u2019s very nearly large enough to swim in.There is a door in the right wall of the bedroom which is currently locked, although no keyhole is visible.Disregarding the doors on the left and right, Naoki proceeds directly through the central room through to the bedroom. With one hand, she gestures to the dominant bit of furniture, and speaks, \u201cThis is the sleeping bed- we don\u2019t stain it.\u201d Without stopping, she proceeds around the bed to the left, to the door situated on that wall. At a touch of her hand, it unlocks and opens inward, revealing a peculiar sort of room just beyond. The room is square and somewhat sizeable, but not overly so. The floor is of polished wooden boards and the walls are the same, though a different sort of wood. A single enormous mirror fills the right wall. Tables with restraints, stocks, and other devices stand around the floor. A bed stands against one wall, though it isn\u2019t quite as large or luxurious as its fellow in the room behind them. Two hooks are embedded in the ceiling. A table and several shelves hold a variety of whips, manacles, and other\u2026 instruments. \u201cThis,\u201d Naoki continues as she strides over to it, \u201cIs the fun bed.\u201dQuirking an eyebrow at the creature on her shoulder, Naoki smirks as she asks, \u201cAre you hungry?\u201d", "1478412823000": "\u201cMmmmh\u2026\u201d A half murmur of acknowledgment, half moan, Naki notes with some level of amusement Forni\u2019s abilities of secretion. Not so much because she finds it amusing that he\u2019s able to secrete things, but because the phrase, \u2018abilities of secretion\u2019 is an amusing phrase to consider. Though she may only find that to be the case due to the somewhat slaphappy demeanor\u00a0she sometimes adopts when aroused.\u00a0As she removes the bathrobe and drapes it over a device, not unlike an iron maiden, Naoki wonders if Forni also has 'abilities of ejaculation', or perhaps 'abilities of insemination'. That certainly would be interesting, she muses. In any case, she intends to find out, and thoroughly explore all of Forni\u2019s various abilities, skills, and proficiencies until such a point wherein he is \u2018full\u2019, or she passes out. Whichever. To this end, she seats herself upon the bed and makes an inviting sort of gesture with her tail. For a moment she contemplates offering some comment to the effect of \u2018bon app\u00e9tit\u2019, but decides that doing so would be awful of her, and holds her tongue.", "1489987472000": "The trip from the Northern Gate to The Chalet did not take terribly long, as they traveled by way of The Sun, and the teleposistion room therein. Now, Naoki leads the way out into the main lounge. Floor-to-ceiling windows provide an incredible view of the lake and surrounding mountains. Leather couches and comfortable chairs dot the floor in several clusters around coffee tables. In the center of the room, a large, square, freestanding stone fireplace crackles invitingly. A well-stocked bar presides over the rear of the room, the counter formed from a slice down the middle of a stout tree, polished to a mirror finish. Hunting trophies adorn the walls. Fur rugs cushion the cedar planking of the floor. Wrought-iron chandeliers hang from the bare roof beams. Against each wall, a suit of plate armor stands silent guard. One of them grasps a halberd, the other holds a sword and shield out in front of him. Where the coat of arms might be were these relics possessed by a noble warrior, there is emblazoned a Midnight Sun logo. Relics of an age past, perhaps, but kept around for primarily sentimental reasons. Moving toward the center of the room, Naoki selects one of the larger couches to seat herself upon, and glances upward, to the window. The light of the sun shines almost directly downward; it\u2019s high noon. Almost anyone could plausibly be around at this hour; someone may end up walking in. For that reason, and certainly, not out of any personal concern of her own, she hopes that Haru will keep that blanket about him. At least for now.Speaking of, Naoki turns slightly to observe Haru, see what he thinks of the room. She brought him to this room with the idea that it\u2019s large enough for him to transform in comfortably, but he also - as far as she can tell - can\u2019t write or communicate clearly while big and fluffy. ", "1490341746000": "Leaning slightly to the one side, Naoki extends one arm to place her hand on Haru\u2019s head, between his eye and ear. Slowly, she slides it up toward his ear and finds out some interesting things. Firstly, her earlier assertion, that Haru is \u201ca soft kitty\u201d would seem to be entirely correct, after further observation. This fact is pleasing. Secondly, it\u2019s interesting to note that while the fur on an average cat might be perhaps an inch long if it\u2019s a particularly soft cat in question, Haru\u2019s fur, even here on his head, is considerably longer. This property makes him an exceptionally soft kitty, to a degree that Naoki has yet to witness until this day. This fact too, Naoki finds to be pleasing. As such, she settles into a rhythm, beginning above the closer of his two eyes, and moving her palm up toward his ears as much as the reach of her arm allows. Silently, she makes a note to obtain a brush with a long handle, as to be able to pet Haru more efficiently.With her other hand, Naoki reaches into her pocket and extracts the bit of paper Haru had written on earlier. She unfolds it and holds it up to read it again, perhaps as if the words on the page have changed. \u201cAre you a worthy master for Haru?\u201dThey have not. In considering the question, Naoki regards Haru as an entity, and what sort of thing he might be, what kind of history he might have. After an amount of contemplation, she\u2019s content to consider him \u201csome manner of big fluffy cat-dragon\u201d and move on to attempting to try her worthiness in his eyes. \u201cHaru,\u201d she begins, lowering her voice as her mouth isn\u2019t very far from his ear, \u201cWould a worthy master feed you, provide you with a suitable place to sleep, treat your wounds when you are injured and do other such things as that? Is that the sort of worthiness you\u2019re getting at, or do you mean something else?\u201d", "1490782746000": "\u201cAlright,\u201d Naoki says, as she moves to sit up with her legs crossed. Setting the piece of paper aside, she silently him for a few moments. \u201cI can do that.\u201d\u201cIf there is something similar that I\u2019m not thinking of at the moment along the lines of caring for you, I can probably do that too. I will mention, the city we were in, I am in charge of that city, The City of Isra, and own a great many of things in it. I can do a great many things, such as live in this overly spacious and extravagant house.\u201dWith one hand, she gestures toward the rest of the Chalet. Haru wouldn\u2019t have been able to observe the full size of it on the way in, due to not being able to see the exterior and there being a fair bit of magical trickery in play regarding the \u201cfull size.\u201d However, one can easily see out the window the opposite wing, across an expanse of snow at an obtuse angle. If one were to approach the window, they could see the central section as well. Tilting her head in one direction and quirking an ear in the other, she asks, \u201cIs there anything else you would expect a \u2018worthy master\u2019 to do?\u201d", "1491681624000": "Naoki looks on with bated breath as Forni and Haru examine each other. The two separate without incident, and that\u2019s fine enough, she supposes. \u201cThis is Fornilan, and he\u2019s a sort of demon,\u201d Naoki says. \u201cHe already shares a bond with me similar to the one you\u2019re describing, so he is not to be eaten, played with, hurt, or anything else of that sort.\u201d Following this statement, she reaches up with her right hand to rub the side of Forni\u2019s head in the way he prefers. Affection is something Naoki has in spades; there is plenty for both of them. She continues to idly rub at Forni as she watches Haru transform, seat himself, and begin to write. It doesn\u2019t seem to be very much trouble for him, she notes. That\u2019s going to be very convenient, though perhaps the nakedness might offend some. Leaning to one side, Naoki reads Haru\u2019s latest writings. Raising one eyebrow, she looks up to face Haru. In a tone bordering on the shamelessly lascivious, she asks, \u201cSo you would like me to ride you?\u201d She smirks a bit to herself; questions like those practically ask themselves. In a significantly more disciplined tone, she continues, \u201cThat\u2019s very agreeable to me and more than doable. In answer to your first question, I would say that, yes, I am a suitable Master for Haru, and further, I would like to be Haru\u2019s Master.\u201dUnsure how such an agreement might be formalized, Naoki pauses her Forni Fondling to extend her hand toward Haru for shaking. ", "1492418129000": "\u201cThe speed\u2026? I don\u2019t\u2026\u201dLooking up, Naoki watches Haru pace back and forth, her eyes following as he moves from one side of the rug to the other. He certainly is a big fluffy kitty. She cannot help but smile slightly.Heaving a small sigh, she acquiesces. \u201cAlright, then.\u201dNaoki rises from her seat, and begins off in a direction, toward one of the hallways across the room. She gestures for Haru to follow, though she suspects the gesture to be unnecessary. As she walks, her earring glimmers quietly, as she makes ready The Chalet for their departure. It wouldn\u2019t do for the pair of them to be incinerated by any of the magical defenses, or construed as a threat and fired upon.It would only take a minute to arrive at a set of double doors leading into a vestibule leading outside. Naoki motions for Haru to wait as she enters the room. There, after making sure Forni is well situated, she dons a vest and scarf, before returning to open the other door for Haru, and then the other two, allowing Haru outside. She then closes all of the doors behind herself as she follows him outside. There, she stops, standing under the protective overhang offered by the porch. Her scarf covers the lower half of her face and the ends flap in the wind. She holds her hands in her armpits, squinting her eyes against the cold. Despite the location of The Chalet, Naoki does not at all like the cold and does not go out into the snow of her own volition without an excellent reason for doing so. In this case, she has made an exception, on the assumption that Haru will be flying somewhere warmer, but as she thinks the matter through, she begins to realize what an awful assumption that was.Before regret can set in too deeply, Naoki shuffles her way over toward Haru and quirks her head to the side slightly, unsure of how exactly the logistics of these things are to work. He had written the word carry, but surely he doesn't mean with his paws, he must mean for her to ride him, as one might a horse. She had thought that there would have been a more involved process to this, involving the creation of a saddle, and probably wearing some riding pants. Glancing down, Naoki notes the impracticality of her current attire, and quietly frowns beneath her scarf.", "1494714402000": "Without too much trouble, Naoki climbs her way up to sit astride Haru. She does note that he is, indeed, quite soft on the top as well, but also lacks\u2026 handles. Or stirrups, or a saddle, or any of that, which makes it somewhat difficult to situate one\u2019s self very securely. Still, she grabs two handfuls of fur in what she hopes is not an uncomfortable manner for Haru, shuts her eyes, and holds tightly as he takes flight.When the rushing air cuts off so abruptly, Naoki opens one eye, morbidly curious as to the sudden change. Was death indeed as quick as all that? It\u2019s hard to say, but either way, they\u2019re still on their way up, almost entirely vertically. It seems as if something is keeping her backside where it is on Haru\u2019s back, but Naoki is not quite so trusting as to loosen her grip. As they hurtle past a cloud and its point of reference contextualizes their speed, Naoki swallows unconsciously, suddenly very aware of how terribly quickly they\u2019re going, how high in the sky they are, and how powerless she is to do much of anything about any part of it. Once they come to a stop, Naoki raises her head, and looks right back at Haru, before taking his hint and looking off, down past her boot, and toward the horizon. The first object of note is- yes, the city. Sitting there as a sprawling unnatural growth, thereupon the plains laid out before her, it is unmistakable. It doesn\u2019t look particularly good from this angle, she notes. Might have to work on that. And then the river; The Silverion River, cutting its way through the landscape, from the mountains on the left to Isra to the right, and then toward the ocean on the horizon. Speaking of the horizon, Naoki notes with some level of wonder that she can see the horizon apparently curving around her, which means that they must be impossibly high\u2026 (Or at least she is.) She\u2019ll need to do the math when she gets back, and consult with Liz; Naoki\u2019s never heard of any Dawn Riders ascending to such altitudes as this.In her looking about, Naoki also notices the bubble-like manifestation of magic and presumes that it must be Haru\u2019s doing. Turning her attention back toward him, Naoki moves one hand to give Haru a few head scratches. \u201cYou certainly are very fast, I will admit,\u201d she says quietly. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we go visit the sea?\u201d With one finger, she points off to the west, toward the smooth, blue expanse that is the ocean.", "1496090661000": "Skarlet would find Naoki in the Chalet\u2019s large library, seated on a cushion by the fireplace with a book. Judging by the diagrams visible, the book is about stars and the night sky, and on this page, a particular constellation is detailed. As Skarlet approaches, Naoki sets the book aside and turns to face her, smiling slightly.  As Skarlet poses her questions, Naoki\u2019s smile fades as she adopts a more sober, thoughtful expression.  \u201cYes, what I have done is recharacterized The Free States into The Isran Empire, and formally installed myself as its Empress. It is essentially just a relabeling; I have yet to institute any major reforms, but it does leave me as an Empress, yes.\u201d Tapping one finger on her chin, Naoki spends a few moments in consideration before continuing, \u201cAnd I believe that it would, yes. If we are to say that I have created The Imperial House of Isra, that would make me- if we are to use more of the relevant terms than are strictly necessary, Her Imperial Majesty, The Empress Regnant Naoki, among other offices. And that would make you something along the lines of, Her Imperial Highness, The Lady, or Princess, Skarlet, depending on which of the two you would prefer.\u201d", "1496174069000": "As Skarlet speaks Silias, Naoki nods slightly, pleased that Skarlet seems to have found someone she enjoys spending time with in that way. She was aware in a general sense that Skarlet has been seeing someone, but hasn\u2019t pried for details- this is the first Naoki has heard of his name. \u201cMmh, that\u2019s good to hear. And how do you feel about him? How does he treat you? Well, I hope.\" At the end of her sentence, Naoki\u2019s tone drops a bit to become more serious, implying that she\u2019s hoping primarily for Silias\u2019 sake.", "1496457414000": "\u201cGood, good\u2026\u201d Nodding, Naoki is pleased that Skarlet seems pleased with the current state of those arrangements- if she weren't, something would need to be changed. \u201cHow am I?...\u201d The question catches Naoki off guard; it\u2019s not something she\u2019s often asked.  After spending a few moments to ask herself the same question and come up with an answer, she responds, \u201cI am well enough. I can\u2019t complain. But I am in a strange spot mentally, as I\u2019ve gone and accomplished essentially all of the distinct goals I\u2019ve ever had. So the question has become, what changes would I see fit to make to the world, and what will I do in the coming years? All of the answers I\u2019ve come up with are broad, indistinct, and impossible to work directly toward.\u201d", "1503213218000": "Sometime later, Empress Naoki  and Reese Cresno  snap into existence in a large and sparsely decorated room lit only by runic markings glowing in the floor. \u201cWelcome,\u201d Naoki says, immediately starting for the door, \u201cto Chalet du Sommet Minuit. Gauldish. Loosely, \u2018Cottage of the Midnight Mountaintop,\u2019 often referred to only as \u2018The Chalet.\u2019 My home, and now also yours.\u201dEmerging from the arrival room, Naoki leads the way in what, by all appearances, seems to be a grand entry hall, with doors and staircases leading every which way, lit by elegant chandeliers, decorated with all manner of tasteful art. Those sensitive would notice the magic immediately. Powerful and pervasive, everywhere for miles around, in addition to smaller magics confined to individual objects, such as the door across the way that Naoki opens.Beyond lies a hallway, tall and wide. A single, obnoxiously long carpet runs down the middle. To either side, there are occasional doors, paintings, small tables with trinkets, and comfortable seating. Beginning down the hall, Naoki steps backward to face Reese as she addresses him. \u201cYou may need to establish offices elsewhere, but this will be home. You are of greater import than most, a card I\u2019d like to keep inside my sweater if you would. As I\u2019m sure you can see, a large number of exceedingly robust protections are in place here. More so than The Citadel, more so than any other location on this plane, as far as I\u2019m aware. The only places safer are beyond this world. Here I feel comfortable.\u201dSo much may be evident in the form of small differences in her behavior. Within The Citadel, there are appearances to maintain, eyes everywhere. Her gait down the hall is less precise, her shoulders sag slightly, and her arms move as she walks.", "1503347306000": "\u201cHmph.\u201d\u201cAs an aside, I note you\u2019re the first person to refer to me as \u2018Madame\u2019 in.. perhaps, maybe a year. Though I don\u2019t mind in the least, you needn\u2019t whatsoever address me formally in private. You're above that. I suspect it's a habit of yours, though.\" She moves one finger with each word, waving all her left side. \"I suppose, that means, that I've just made a formality out of talking about formality.\" \u201cIn any case, Large portions of the house are empty. Partially to accommodate more residents, such as yourself, and partly because we ran out of ideas. My majordomo manages such things, I\u2019ll have them offer you a full tour and a map later - probably won't need the map.\u201d\u201cI tell you this because the rooms you\u2019ll be using are essentially empty; there\u2019s no reason for me to lead you there. Instead, we will sit\u201d she says, timing perfectly with the opening of one particularly important-looking door, \u201c...in the library.\u201dAnd what a library it is. With a wave of her hand, Naoki presents the library to Reese, as seeking his approval.Grown from the burgeoning collection of books behind her desk in The Midnight Sun, it seems as if she's has collected some thousands of books to stock the library. The library may be remarkable in the sense of how airy may feel. Many libraries make use of high towering bookcases - all very close together to fit as many books as possible. In contrast, the Chalet's shelves are short, appropriate for bending and perhaps sitting upon.Which is to say, The Lady cannot be bothered to use a stool or goodness forbid, a ladder. Either that or perhaps it was built with smaller people in mind.What is not underdone is the fireplace. In the center of the room, it stands freely, a focal point for the rest of the library. It has big, tall-backed chairs placed all around it, fit for intense lounging, contemplation, or perhaps storytelling, complete with footrests. Small tables and other chairs are scattered about, with a ring of carpets around the center. The Chalet was, after all, engineered with maximum coziness in mind. Within the course of a few moments Naoki is seated, her overcoat slung over the back of the chair. The fire crackles in the silence, popping for their amusement. \u201cWhere should I begin?\u201d", "1504374386000": "Naoki's head turns, she looks at Reese. Stares at him for a moment. As the fire crackles loudly in the silence, she sees its flames reflected in the polish on his skull. For a moment she steps back to look at everything from an objective point of view. She\u2019s sitting here in front of the fire with this animated skeleton as if he\u2019s an old friend of hers. He doesn\u2019t have a face.The joke then is, she is, and it\u2019s true - and it\u2019s happening right now. The absurdity of it all strikes her, and Naoki huffs a single snort of amusement.\u201cAn excellent idea,\u201d she says with a hint of sarcasm. \u201cIt may, then, be best for me to tell you first of my efforts as they've related to the state, and the state of the state, as it were.\u201d\u201cSuch things are perhaps of the greatest import, depending on what you value in information most. From the aspect of the historian, indeed, I would think. I\u2019ve done an awful lot in these few years, and how I did it is - if I might say so, somewhat exceptional. But I digress- I\u2019ll then go back and give detail after I establish this core for my story.\u201dWith that having been said, Naoki pauses to collect her thoughts. Reaching into her pouch, Naoki pulls out a small handful of gemstones, each about the size of her thumb nail. She sets all but one on the arm of the chair and begins to idly play with the other one, as is her habit.In such a manner, she begins. \u201cI\u2019ll start at that point, years ago, when I had first decided to go secure for myself a seat on The Assembly when I began to gather \u2018power\u2019 for the first time.\u201dWith \u201cpower,\u201d Naoki motions quotation marks in the air with her fingers, stressing the word.\u201cAnd that was a trivial matter, as it turned out. A few months following, I set my sights on a higher position, following Grandma\u2019s appointment as \u2018Minister for the Defense\u2019 or whatever it was. You ought to remember as much as this\u2026\u201d\u201cAnd I went, and the visit to The Citadel for that- to get that position was interesting enough - though it lacks details significant to the narrative I\u2019m laying out. Let it suffice to say that I walked out of The Citadel that day as Isra\u2019s treasurer.\u201d\u201cThat,\u201d she says, brandishing one finger, \u201cWas really what started me off, that position. It was more than just a foothold; I used that influence in everything, moving forward; and I still do. It\u2019s where histories of me will start, I think. The Sun\u2026 The Sun will be a tertiary detail, even though it seems so significant as the metaphorical foundation of my life today.\u201dShe pauses again, staring blankly off into the fire. There's much to think about there, about The Midnight Sun, and path she's struck from there to here. After a moment she continues, \u201cBut it was the purse strings, Reese, is what I had. They have more sway over things than the driving reins, and I saw as much firsthand. ... You\u2019ll recall, \u2018He who holds the purse strings, rules the house, the nation, the world.\u2019\u201d She says this in a faithful imitation of Reese's voice, as it was he that spoke those words in the context of a discussion on history.A pause. \u201cThat\u2019s truer than anything. All of the things I\u2019ve taken away from my studies - that fact is perhaps the truest- if there is such a thing. \u2026 My favor became the most important sort of favor. From my appointment as Treasurer to election as Lady, it was a more or less linear progression. It was just a matter of growing influence - and that's been the easiest part. It\u2019s been my legwork, so to speak\u2026\u201dTrailing off, Naoki continues over the course of the next few hours to relate her story to Reese. She never does get around to going back to fill in detail as she alluded to because the direction of her \u201cstrokes\u201d is nowhere near clear enough to be filled in around. She rambles and rambles, making progress very slowly, digressing into all manner of potentially interesting secondary topics along the way. Whether or not Reese finds the topics interesting, Naoki doesn\u2019t seem to be putting much thought into. She\u2019s careful to mention everything significant- everything he needs to have a full enough understanding but shines her own little lights on many details Reese wouldn\u2019t ever inquire about.Somewhere along the way, a well dressed young lady comes in with a mug of hot chocolate. Naoki takes it, smiling and thanking the woman, and the woman gives Reese a respectful nod to the effect of, \u201cYou can\u2019t drink and we both know it, but if you did, I would have brought you something - the intention is there.\u201d An intention she hopes he would understand, one that she presumes he's seen before.After a time, Naoki reaches a natural stopping point- just after telling him about her most recent move: declaring Isra an Empire and herself an Empress. \u201cAnd so ends what I feel you\u2019ve missed. Everything else I have to tell you is relevant to this moment- to today, and tomorrow...\u201d She trails off, allowing Reese a word in.", "1505573555000": "Naoki scoffs good-naturedly, chuckles, and smiles. His swings at humor are, in a way, endearing. And when did he become such a flatterer? \u201cIf there were anyone better, I would have hired them already. You occupy a niche, Reese, of impeccable quality. You do so very well. There are others who practice your skills, yes, but you are irreplaceable and without peer, as far as I\u2019m concerned. I am, as I always have been, honored, incredibly fortunate to have you around. I\u2019m very pleased that you\u2019re back, and I\u2019ll have the opportunity to work with you again.\u201dNaoki pauses for a moment. Her earring glows slightly- she\u2019s speaking telepathically to someone. Reese might notice it is not the same earring he made for her years previously.\u201cBut I\u2019m not quite finished with you yet. If I might, I\u2019d like to speak about what I\u2019d like you to do.\u201d\u201cFirstly, I would like to ask for a number of accessories. I\u2019ll provide you with a written list tomorrow, but among my requests, I would like a new earring, replacements for many of my spell-gems, and some manner of channeling aid that I might use to cast them better.\u201d She counts on her fingers as she goes, one, two, three, four.\u201cOnce your study and workshop or however are set up, I expect you\u2019ll resume your crafting. I think that you\u2019ll appreciate working with effectively limitless pockets. Anything that was once prohibitively expensive, or unobtainable by the Sun\u2019s staff - all of it is doable. You\u2019ll be able to work on as large of a scale as you like, with the very best tools and materials, whatever they may be.\u201d\u201cYou can see, as well, I\u2019ve amassed a vast collection of reading material, and I think you\u2019ll find much of it to be of interest; there are all sorts of spell books, grimoires, and codexes that are beyond me, beyond my knowledge to understand. In addition to this library and the one in the Citadel, there\u2019s the new public library, though there isn\u2019t anything much there that isn\u2019t also here. And I keep the most valuable and dangerous books sealed away. I\u2019ll show you where they are later.\u201dThen, the door opens. A page enters, one of the young and mostly oblivious ones. In his hands, he holds a wooden cube, polished to a flawless finish. A cube, and not a box, because there doesn\u2019t seem to be any hinge, handle, nor does it seem as if there\u2019s supposed to be.Naoki beckons him over, and the page comes. He hands her the cube, and she thanks him. He then offers a needlessly formal bow before turning to exit. Only once the door is closed behind him and they are alone again does Naoki turn her attention to the cube. She sets it on her lap and studies it for a moment before turning it so that another one of its seemingly featureless sides is facing up. Placing her hand atop it, Naoki spreads her fingers and closes her eyes, seemingly concentrated. A moment passes, and then another. Something begins to rise out of the box under her hand - into her hand. Pulling her hand away, Naoki now holds a gemstone, a sapphire of considerable size. It's the first time she\u2019s seen it, so Naoki pauses for a moment to have a look at it. It\u2019s nothing more than what she expected, she supposes. A blue gemstone about as large as her fist, finely cut. Though she\u2019s unable to sense as much, she knows that there\u2019s incredible power within, far beyond everything contemporary, far beyond any gem Reese has dealt with. Likely.Extending her arm, Naoki offers it to Reese, such that he might have a look of his own. \u201cDo you know what this is?\u201d she asks.", "1506193218000": "\u201cThis, my friend, is one of the Gems of Croeria. One of four. This one has elemental properties related to water and is aptly colored as such. The other three represent fire, earth, and air. Grandma acquired this one on my behalf from the dragon Jarkoopi, who I think you\u2019ll remember. He had been guarding it for however long since whatever party decided to hide the gems. Grandma arbitrated a contract between he and I, wherein he was made to acquiesce to my terms under the implied threat of force. He got his war crimes cleared, though, so I suppose it wasn\u2019t a bad trade for him.\u201d Naoki shrugs. The dragon isn't of much importance to her anymore.\u201cWe currently possess - you may be surprised to hear, three out of the four. We acquired the fire Gem from Goraia, who had taken it from Sakand, who in turn had taken it from its hiding place years ago. And the earth Gem is currently over at Castle Hylon, hidden and locked away. Camilla reobtained it following some manner of magical shenanigans I don\u2019t have a full understanding of. We effectively have possession of it, though. Just a matter of taking it.\u201d\u201cAnd having those three is certainly nice. In the same way that The Kami is nice, as insurance of the heavy-hitting, vaporize-the-problem variety. Grandma and I did a bit of testing to see what sort of output they\u2019re capable of, and the answer, in short, is that they\u2019re monstrously powerful - though that\u2019s probably apparent to you. Even so, both she and I were surprised, as we had underestimated them.\u201d\u201cBut,\u201d Naoki says, tilting her head a bit to the side and smirking at Reese, \u201cYou know that I\u2019m not one to stop before the job is done. To be very frank for just a moment, I intend to acquire the fourth one as well. The air Gem. I\u2019ve heard it said that the whole collection functions as more than the sum of its parts, and that\u2019s power\u2026 I wouldn\u2019t mind possessing.\u201d She shrugs facetiously, grinning.\u201cHowever, the whereabouts of the fourth gem is, as far as I\u2019m aware, entirely unknown. I have a few guesses, but none plausible enough to take action on. This part here is where you come in. As your first major project, I would like to enlist your assistance in locating the fourth gem. I figure, if there\u2019s anyone who can do it, it must be you.\u201dA brief pause, then she continues, \u201cAnd I have a few ideas about how we might go about it. Namely, I believe you told me at one point about a particular sort of ritual which is essentially magical triangulation. Wherein we might use the three Gems we have to locate the fourth, with the massive beams of light and such. I\u2019d like your thoughts.\u201d", "1506560918000": "\u201cExcellent,\u201d she says, nodding. This matter has been up in the air for a while, and, as she suspected, Reese is fully capable of handling it. \u201cHow soon?\u201d she continues. \u201cI would like to give you all appropriate time to move, settle in, reacquaint yourself, and such, but I would also like this done as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cAs I see it, to proceed, we would need only a few things. You would need to make the necessary preparations for whatever ritual, study the gems, acquire materials or whatever else. If you give me a list, I will happily obtain whatever it is you require - for this, or generally speaking. Additionally, I would like a means to channel the powers of one or more of these gems we have. Once we have all four, I should like a proper and elegant way to use them - and I have some ideas about that, but I would feel much safer venturing out with even a crude channeling mechanism.\u201d \u201cI suspect that we won\u2019t be unchallenged,\u201d she adds. Her tone of voice may seem strange, in that she doesn\u2019t look particularly worried, per se. Why would she be, after all? She should be worried because the ritual will likely draw the attention of some very powerful sorts, who may wish to take the air gem for themselves or steal one of the others while they\u2019re not locked in a vault. And, in a way, she is a bit apprehensive, but she has no reason to suspect that there is any force capable of going toe-to-toe with her combined and prepared forces. A touch of arrogance, perhaps.", "1507312667000": "Naoki shakes her head. \u201cNo,\u201d she says, smiling pleasantly. \u201cIf all goes as I might like it to, no one will know what I\u2019m doing until it\u2019s done. However, the ritual will, as I understand, not be exceedingly subtle, and there is no shortage of foolishness in this world. As such, I intend to prepare for the worst and end up handily dispatching any troubles that may arise.\u201dHer voice takes on a graver tone, \u201cThis potential battle will be the last we should ever need to worry about, so I\u2019m pulling out the majority of the stops.\u201d", "1508831871000": "Skarlet would find Naoki alone, traversing one of The Chalet\u2019s many hallways.

The muffled sound of winds rushing and a crackling fireplace fills the silence. In fact, windows line the opposite wall, offering an immediate mountain vista. Off to the left, one end of the lake is visible through flurries of snow, frozen. The room is evidently on the second story or higher, as the tops of pine trees are just outside.  The mountain and the forest slope abruptly down toward a lower valley, while the shapes of other mountains fade in and out of view in the background.Contrasting beautifully is the room in which they stand. Lit by soft candlelight and a wide fireplace, the unfinished wood walls, an assortment of rugs, and assorted armchairs lend well to a \u2018warm cabin\u2019 theme, which is present throughout the majority of The Chalet.Big Naoki moves over toward the windows and kneels, providing her passenger an excellent vantage from which to look outside as well as the opportunity to disembark, should she choose to do so. She remains quiet for the moment, smiling slightly as she watches the children in anticipation of the next round of questions. One other door leads out of the room, away from the windows, but it\u2019s shut. Aside from the fireplace, chairs, and a small bookshelf, there isn\u2019t much to be found here; it\u2019s a combination entryway and sitting room.", "1509332673000": "\u201cYes, yes- after you\u2019re clean, yes after you\u2019re clean,\u201d Naoki answers each question in order, pointing to each questioner in turn. \u201cThe first thing we\u2019re doing is baths,\u201d she declares. \u201cThis way.\u201dThe door out of the room opens at Naoki\u2019s touch, leading into yet another hallway. Here, there are paintings on the wall, sconces on both sides, and definite, visible ends to the hall, in the form of turns at either end. Other, similar doors are present up and down, bearing small plaques with words or symbols on them. Symbols such as stairs, a book, fire, a bed marked #5, and their destination: a bathtub. Ushering the children in, they would find the bathing room to be perhaps a more extensive affair than they\u2019re used to- no one needs a place this large for just bathing. Immediately after entering they\u2019re faced by a wall that goes up to about Naoki\u2019s chin. They would be able to pass on either side into one of two mirrored sections, another chin-high wall separating them. This is one of the Chalet\u2019s few rooms partitioned for gender. The room\u2019s surfaces are covered with smooth, grayish tiles, a bit like small stone bricks. Recessed into the floor on both sides there are three circular basins, one large and two small. Notably, they are shallow, no deeper than two feet in the center of the large ones. Soap, towels, and other bathing essentials are available on shelves and hooks which Naoki thinks ought to be accessible by the children with some tip-toes. After the children are in, Naoki pauses just inside the door, unsure of the bathing practices customary for the children. Holding her hands behind her back, she defers to Ms. Higgs, prepared to take part or stand by as appropriate. The staff member she sent to fetch the children\u2019s clothes ought to arrive soon. ", "1509436690000": "Naoki finds little trouble taking a secondary role in the bathing procedures. She handles the dirty clothes, receives the fresh ones, and sets out six little outfits to be put on. She then assists with the drying of the children, the hair especially. Knowing firsthand the difficulties introduced with soft kitty ears and how best to circumvent them, Naoki diligently ensures the appropriate levels of dryness. That's what she tells herself she's doing, at least. A glorified excuse to give ear scratches is what it is. The selected outfits all feature pants, in preparation for putting on coats later.Once everyone is suited up, Naoki ushers them down the hall and around the corner to a set of significant-looking but unlabeled double doors. \u201cThis,\u201d she says, \u201cIs where we\u2019ll be staying.\u201dAs Naoki pushes the doors open, a small bell rings somewhere inside. She stands back to hold the door.Here within The Chalet, Naoki has prepared something similar to a small house. ('Small,' being a relative term.) These double doors are skin to front doors, and the only ones leading in. Immediately through them, there is the sitting room, featuring a fireplace in one corner, an assortment of large chairs, a few bookcases, six little desks, and other typical furniture. It serves as the connecting room to three others, one on each face. To the left is the dining room, with appropriately sized tables and chairs, bunches upon bunches of snacks, and not a single knife. Off to the right of the entrance is the playroom, which contains an awful lot of books for something called a \u2018playroom,\u2019 as well a questionably excessive number of \u201ccommon\u201d children\u2019s toys. Common in that they are mundane such as rocking horses, blocks, plush animals, and so on, but far from common in quality; Naoki sprang for the good stuff. Commissioned a master toymaker, in fact. Many of the toys are signed. A few easels sit in one corner.Finally, directly across from the entrance is the bedroom, a carefully planned affair. Upon entering, one would see three little beds lined up on both the left and right sides. Each one has with it a small dresser, an empty box, a bedside table, a stool, and a short wall to separate it from its neighbor. Down at the far end of the room, the two chests the children packed are sitting on the floor, open, amidst larger dressers. Two doors at the end are labeled \u201cNaoki,\u201d and \u201cMs. Higgs,\u201d and these lead off to regular sized and fully featured bedrooms.Save for those bedrooms; each room is connected by doorways filled with hanging strings of wooden beads. Though unconventional and perhaps a bit out of place, these beads serve a vital purpose - they\u2019re noisy. Every time anyone passes through a doorway, the beads are set in motion, clacking against each other to announce movement. Naoki hopes that the noise won\u2019t become too grating as the days wear on.Once everyone is in, the doors click shut behind them, locking. Naoki, eager to see first impressions, follows the children in.", "1511922320000": "Drying six fidgety children is no mean feat. However, thanks to her own experience with sensitive ears Naoki managed a fair job of getting all of the little terrors dryish. Each one handled the bowling a bit differently Little Naoki sat ramrod straight and didn't fidget at all. Clearly trying to impress her bigger counterpart with her composure. Juniper was almost as good but her tail tended to twitch back forth against her dryer getting them quite wet. Of the girls, Moonflower was the worst wriggling and almost but not quite trying to escape. Caleb was definitely the worst boy since he actively tried to escape. Miss Higgs was forced to handle him, mostly to spare the empress the indignity of wrestling a naked four-year-old boy. Kae was rather passive taking it stoically even seeming to enjoy the ear scratches. Rawr Rawr seemed to like it best almost passing out as he dried off with warm fluffy towels. It appears that he was slowly relaxing and getting used to Naoki's presence. Dressing them proves to be almost as big a hassle as bathing and drying. Both Caleb and Moonflower seem rather deadset on running around in the buff and need some wrangling to get them into their pants. The girls, meanwhile, are not entirely thrilled to be wearing pants, well except for Moonflower. At least, not until Naoki explains that they will work best with the coats for playing in the snow. This gets them to reluctantly tug them on though all the children need some help with that.Still, the power of being adults corraling small children prevails and eventually the kids are cleaned, dressed and ready to go. They follow the empress through the halls until they arrive at the suitably impressive double doors. When they see the inside they look around curiously until they spot the playroom. That gets their attention as those Naoki's words. The children immediately start looking around, even little Rawr Rawr joining in gravitating immediately to the art supplies. \"Wow!\" \"It's so big!\" \"It's like the size of our whole house in a bigger house!\" \"Look at the toys!\" \"Look at the books!\" *repeated sounds of beads rattling as someone plays with them* \"Guys we need to say thank you!\"Little Naoki looks at her siblings drawing their attention then gesturing at her taller counterpart. The kids chorus out a thank you. \"Thank you for letting us stay with you Auntie Naoki!\" They say a split second before deciding proper thanks includes a proper mobbing. A moment later the Empress of Isra is being climbed, hugged, and otherwise affectioned upon by all six children. This would be a very common occurrence in the coming days. If Naoki ever felt there weren't enough hugs in her life, she was about to have that feeling rectified.As the children close in, Naoki stands frozen on the spot, paralyzed in the face of overwhelming cuteness. It takes her a moment to process and adjust before she awkwardly leans forward in an attempt to reciprocate. Though, that only works out but so well, so Naoki takes a knee to improve her position, taking care to ensure no child goes unsqueezed. \u201cYou\u2019re all very welcome,\u201d she says, gently setting someone back on the ground. \u201cNow, amuse yourselves for about ten minutes, then we\u2019ll go play in the snow, alright?\u201d ", "1511923450000": "Nov 27, 2017 21:06:12 GMT -8 Skarlet said:Another day at the Chalet du Sommet Minuit, Skarlet is lounging on a couch in some silky, burgundy-coloured pyjamas. When she sees her foster parent, Empress Naoki  , she greets her with enthusiasm. \"Good morning Mother!\"She'd come over to give her a hug first before beginning to speak again,\"What are your thoughts on ghosts?\" Skarlet opened up a new conversation with Naoki. She wanted to talk a little about one of her experiences while she's been away. She always liked speaking with Naoki when she needed to hear from a mortal's perspective on a topic. If anyone else was around too, she'd welcome them sharing what they thought too. \"I met C\u00e9line while I was in Rondon.\"Skarlet finds Naoki shuffling through The Chalet in a robe, nursing a mug of something dark and cinnamon-smelling. She greets Skarlet with a smile and a one-armed hug, holding her drink off to one side.\u201cGhosts\u2026?\u201d Naoki repeats thoughtfully, wholly unprepared for the question.\u201cI can\u2019t say I\u2019ve met any ghosts, funnily enough -- so I don\u2019t have any foundation upon which to base an opinion of any real strength. Though I suppose if one\u2019s essence doesn\u2019t have anything better to do\u2026\u201d She shrugs.\u201cIt\u2019s not one of the afterlife options I\u2019m considering, at least. \u2026 What was it like, meeting her?\u201d ", "1511929790000": "\u201cMmmmh.\u201d Naoki nods and sips her drink. Keeping spirits appeased is often a better idea than not.\u201cI can only imagine how that must have been.\u201d Ruminating on her trips through Skarlet\u2019s dreams and to the Zeidler home, she does precisely that, leaving a comfortable silence for a few moments. Must be pretty strange to be the ghost of C\u00e9line Zeidler. Naoki wouldn\u2019t have suspected the existence of such a spirit. It comes along with the implicit idea that Skarlet is very much her own individual, separated by such a clear delineation. \u201cIt\u2019s good that the\u2026\u201d Naoki hesitates on the word choice. \u201cThe two of you are on good terms, as it were. Avoids any potential trouble were you not.\u201d", "1512264005000": "Listening, Naoki\u2019s expression turns to one of careful consideration. It\u2019s a bit early in her day for existential questions, she thinks, but after a few moments of thought, she gives it her best shot.\u201cOne of the most interesting things, I think is how magic chooses to apply in any given situation. Apply, or alternatively manifest, in situations where multiple sorts of magic could, potentially. An easy example is the afterlife. What happens when you die? One of the big questions. It depends. One option is the Demonic Realm with whose lords I\u2019ve socialized with -- The Hellscape. I imagine I will probably end up there, in the very end, but not everyone will. Some people simply die, leaving behind absolutely nothing but a corpse. Some return as ghosts or specters -- sometimes of their own volition, sometimes not.\u201dNaoki shrugs with one arm as she takes a sip of her drink. \u201cThere\u2019s also those whose souls are captured and put in jars before they have a chance to go anywhere else. Some souls are eaten. Some people don\u2019t even have a soul in the same sense as some others, and something entirely different happens when they die. Some of us...\u201d She gestures at Skarlet with her mug.\u201c...Are effectively immortal. Does the concept of afterlife still apply, and if so, does it apply in the same way to you as it might to me? \u2026 Hard to say. Impossible, even, until the moment it happens, I feel. It presumably depends on your actions and the choices you make in life, but the entire field of study on this topic is essentially banging its head against the wall, and has been for a while.\u201d\u201cAs I've read, observations and arduous testing confirm some things, such as that often, in the context of the afterlife, what one thinks will happen, happens. Remote tribes that don\u2019t speak Common have never heard of the Hellscape, and as a result, few of them will end up there. They seem to go to the 'promised land' of their religion. seemingly because that's where they think they'll go.\u201dAll warmed up, Naoki pauses to take another sip of her drink.\u201cAnother experiment aims to conclusively claim that their magic, with their totem poles and their soothsayers, is just as valid as any other, and functions just as well. In one study, someone like that -- a remote-tribal sort, a powerful magical one, was brought to what passed for civilization at the time, learned the language (a dialect of elvish), and attempted to learn their magics.\u201d\u201cHe couldn\u2019t. And they tried all manner of things in due course of experimentation, but to the end, despite all efforts, he never could do elven magics. If you start thinking that things like beliefs and heritage playing into things, the topic gets very complicated and nigh-unsolvable very quickly.\u201d\u201cSo,\u201d Naoki says, reeling it back in, \u201cI feel I can\u2019t give you a good answer to that question, and I don\u2019t think anyone can provide a definitive answer.\u201d\u201cBut. Considering, I think it likely that C\u00e9line believed in ghosts. They\u2019re so ingrained in general understandings and notable literature that I think it entirely plausible that anyone could believe that ghosts exist, even those in realms where they don\u2019t. So, perhaps, since you think you will, in the very end, end up with more ghosts than just C\u00e9line .\u201d\u201cBut it\u2019s hard to say. ... A tangentially related, equally nuanced, and just as relevant of a topic is that of identity. What we are, really, what a 'soul' is, what it means to be conscious, the nature of consciousness, and so on.\u201d Naoki waves one hand dismissively, writing the whole thing off as something she isn\u2019t going to start monologuing about right now.", "1513713104000": " As she\u2019s listening, Naoki finishes her drink and sets it aside. She nods soberly. \u201cThat\u2019s morality for you. In your context, the wills of omniscient entities may come into play, and they may base their decisions based on the intentions of any given individual. At that point, who can say?\u201d \u201cThings will go well for you, though; I\u2019ve power enough to ensure that. Grandma, The Black Tower\u2026 They and others deal in great, cosmic powers that are beyond my understanding \u2014 but they\u2019re loyal to me. I am confident that whatever happens, you will be taken care of.\u201d Naoki adds emphasis by leaning over to touch the end of her tail to the top of Skarlet\u2019s head.\u201cI don\u2019t think you need to worry about such things,\u201d she continues, \u201cNot yet. There\u2019s time to consider those kinds of matters, for you especially \u2014 lots of time.\u201d\u201cIn my case \u2014 I should tell you; I wouldn\u2019t be going to join the innumerable morass of souls being tortured in the Hellscape. Nonono. I would be going to \u2014 and I realize how this sounds said aloud, become a demon.\u201d\u201cA high-end demon, of the Lust Circle,\u201d she adds. \u201cAs I have met the current Demonlady of Lust. I summoned her here, to The Chalet, and we spoke. We spoke, forged a contract, and I got to know her very well.\u201d Naoki skips right over that part.\u201cOne of the terms in our contract \u2014 essentially the only significant term, is such that, once I am finished with life and whatever else my soul might like to do afterward \u2014 to be a ghost, to reincarnate, or whatever else, I \u2014 my soul, will join her in the Lust Circle, to be, and I quote, her \u2018partner.\u2019\u201dAfter a few moments she continues, quick to elaborate, \u201cIt was an excellent deal. I remain quite satisfied with it, and while I\u2019m not necessarily looking forward to that eventuality, I\u2019m comfortable in knowing that there will be that, as opposed any unknown.\u201d She gestures, referring to what they were talking about a short while ago.", "1514076559000": "\u201cEveryone needs a hobby.\u201d Naoki grins, finding it amusing to dismiss the topic in such a way.There\u2019s a pause before she answers, \u201cAlright.\u201d She has no issue with this.\u201cI\u2019ll be in the city tonight, but I won\u2019t be doing anything of great import \u2014 nothing I can\u2019t walk away from. Remember that Juns need to be fed regularly, and I\u2019ll tell you: they don\u2019t handle alcohol well. I wouldn\u2019t offer it.\u201d", "1539048749000": "In among the mess of basements, vaults, and tunnels, deep below The Chalet, lies a room that is all but perfectly cubical, twenty meters to a side. The walls, ceiling, and floor are of nondescript stone bricks of average size. There is exactly one door, a huge swinging affair, made of metal and covered in runes. Naoki now returns to this room for the first time in some years, with a basket in one hand and a book under her arm. Things seem to be largely as she left them, with the dais in the center, the table on the right, and candles around the edges\u2014all still lit. It\u2019s a purpose-built room, and reflecting on it, she applauds the design. It\u2019s the candles and that dim, flickering light that really give it the \"ritualistic charm,\" as it were.After ensuring the door is properly shut, she deposits her basket on the table and unceremoniously drops the book beside it, kicking up some dust in the process. It\u2019s a large book\u2014a tome, even, bound in purple letter and quite thick. It is none other than Wes\u2019 Grand Compendium of Summoning, by Wes the Wizard, legendary summoner of an age long past. As far as Naoki is aware, only three copies exist today, and she owns all of them. None are available to the public, as Wes\u2019 Compendium is an exceptionally dangerous book, even as books of dark magic go. Because not only does Wes\u2019 Compendium go on about the theory of summoning and the magical principles involved, it also provides step-by-step instructions that anyone can follow, regardless of any magical talent or lack thereof.Using a bookmark she placed earlier, Naoki turns to the relevant chapter. Chapter 17: Making Polite Requests of Those Otherworldly Entities With Whom You Have Already Built Some Rapport. After skimming the preface she locates the instructions. Running her finger down the page, she reads over the instructions once more and checks that she brought all of the requisite materials. Chalk: red, white, and black. Check. Ritual candles x15. Check, with extras.Incense: bayberry for asserting control, and cinnamon for lust. Check, and check.Nightshade oil. Check.A handful of chromium dust. Check.Ground roots of a bilberry bush. Check. Maybe not enough, but check.And a dash of oregano, check.Satisfied that she has all she needs, the Naoki spends the next half-hour preparing the ritual. Drawing the lines, arranging the candles, setting up the incense, making sure that everything that's supposed to be on fire is, and vice-versa. Only half of these preparations are strictly necessary\u2014the altar itself is doing most of the work, but it\u2019s Naoki\u2019s thought that if it\u2019s worth performing a demonic summoning ritual, it\u2019s worth performing a demonic summoning ritual well, and that means going all-out on the thematics.Once she\u2019s finished, Naoki surveys her work and compares it to the descriptions in Wes\u2019 Compendium. The shapes are aligned properly, the candles are where they ought to be, and she didn\u2019t forget the oregano. Some of Wes\u2019theorems have since been outdated and Naoki has modified the ritual significantly to suit her purposes, but it seems right. \u2026 More or less. Then it is time to begin. After removing her clothing and placing it on the table, Naoki approaches the altar with one of the candles. Stepping carefully as not to ruin any of her straight lines, she extends the candle up to the center of the altar and uses it to light the last unlit candle in the center ring. Immediately, the innermost series of runes burst into flame for an instant, then begin to glow. Like ripples in a pond, the other runes come alight and begin to glow in a similar manner. Naoki steps back hurriedly, holding her tail high as not to have it set alight (again). After only a few moments, all of the runes are glowing, and some of them begin to rise and move about.  Things to feel\u2026 warmer as lust magic suffuses the room, and an unnatural wind begins to blow, threatening to extinguish the candles. Naoki takes this to mean it\u2019s working.Rather than chanting, Naoki opted to write her message in runes\u2014that\u2019s the outermost ring. The message is supposed to translate to, \u201cIf you would please, send me another tentacle beast. I enjoyed the last one very much, thank you,\u201d but she suspects she may have botched the grammar. Suddenly, with an all-too-loud noise, space itself cracks. Light refracts in indescribable ways as Naoki attempts perceive that which isn\u2019t there. That would be the portal, she supposes. If things go as she intends, her new friend ought to drop out of there pretty soon.", "1539407755000": "As Naoki shields her eyes from the bright light, she begins to get the impression that she didn\u2019t address her message correctly. This is not the same sort of demonic magic she\u2019s come to recognize. She looks on with some trepidation as something drops from the portal and bursts into a mass of tentacles. It looks like she got that bit right, at least.However, once the creature emerges, Naoki gasps, and any worries she may have had about those being the wrong sort of tentacles disappear. It isn\u2019t quite what she was expecting, but it\u2019s so cute. She\u2014clearly a she, says something with a rising inflection. Context would imply that it\u2019s a demonic language of some variety, but it doesn\u2019t sound like anything Naoki is familiar with. \u201cHello,\u201d she greets the demon with some level of decorum, despite the situation. \u201cI am Naoki. I summoned you.\u201d ", "1539565731000": "So she did address the message correctly. Perhaps Charyss has done some redecorating. \u201cI should think so,\u201d Naoki replies. \u201cI am trustful of her judgment.\u201d It will remain to be seen just what a \u201cfamiliar\u201d entails, in comparison to a \u201ctentacle demon,\u201d as Forni styled himself. \u201cWelcome to The Overworld, Koitika\u201d Naoki continues, gesturing at the blank walls around them. \u201cSuch as it is. We are in a basement beneath my home.\u201d\u201cIf I might, I would ask of your\u2026 experience, and relative age. Is this your first time in The Overworld?\u201d ", "1539653949000": "\u201cI see,\u201d Naoki responds, somewhat surprised to hear the phrase \u201cpersonal assistant.\u201d It seems like Lust sent her best and brightest, or at least her smallest and cutest.\u201cThe rest of the house, yes, is decorated. This room is designed to contain the mess if anything goes awry during summoning\u2014summoning demons isn\u2019t an activity for the sitting room, of course.\u201dMaking the assumption that Koitika isn\u2019t hungry just now, Naoki returns to the table and slips back into her clothing.\u201cI don\u2019t know how it compares to Lust\u2019s Pleasure Palace, but this is the best house you\u2019ll find in The Overworld, and it suits my needs well.\u201dIt takes some effort on her part, but Naoki pulls the door open and gestures though it, inviting Koitika to follow her out and upstairs.", "1539892084000": "Naoki holds still as Koitika seats herself on her shoulder. Eight inches isn\u2019t very much in this context, is it? At the comment about morals, Naoki exhales sharply, amused. \u201cA simpler time, I\u2019m sure.\u201d\u201cOh, I almost forgot.\u201d Before leaving, Naoki doubles back to take Wes\u2019 Compendium off the table. She\u2019ll send someone to clean the mess later.Then it\u2019s up the stairs and through a few unremarkable hallways to the main lounge.Two floors are given to this, The Chalet\u2019s primary gathering place. Floor-to-ceiling windows provide an incredible view of the lake and surrounding mountains. Leather couches and easy chairs dot the floor in several clusters around coffee tables. In the center of the room, a large freestanding fireplace crackles invitingly. A well-stocked bar presides over the rear of the room, the counter formed from a slice down the middle of a stout tree polished to a mirror finish. Exotic hunting trophies and tasteful paintings adorn the walls, while fur rugs are scattered across the floor. Wrought-iron chandeliers hang from the roof beams. A suit of plate armor stands silent guard against each wall, with the symbol of The Midnight Sun in the place of a coat of arms\u2014relics of a time past.\u2018The house is called Chalet du Sommet Minuit, which is Gauldish for \u2018Cottage of The Midnight Mountaintop.\u2019 I\u2019ll admit, it\u2019s a bit of a misnomer because this is hardly the top of the mountain, but it sounds better than Chalet \u00e0 C\u00f4t\u00e9 de Lac.\u201d\u201cThere are three wings,\u201d she continues, gesturing to them through the window. \u201cThough the floor plan isn\u2019t quite so neat. You can probably tell there\u2019s a great deal of magic here; some of the hallways connect in strange ways, and some rooms are larger than they should be.\u201d", "1540011494000": "Reaching into the pouch on her hip, Naoki fishes around for a moment before extracting a marble-sized bit of yellow amethyst. Holding it away from her eyes, Naoki activates the gemstone, causing it to glow brightly. Gesturing to it, she explains. \u201cMy artificer\u2014it\u2019s very clever what he\u2019s done. The crystalline structure of a gemstone is apparently well suited for weaving spells into and storing energy. It allows those such as myself, with no innate ability to sense or control magic, to accomplish simple feats.\u201dAfter a moment, the gemstone stops glowing, and Naoki holds it up toward her shoulder for Koitika to examine. \u201cIn addition to the power Charyss allows me to borrow, I have a small collection of these, each with their own function, and they serve well for basic tasks. For anything larger, I have an academy of magi and many of the world\u2019s strongest mages at my command.\u201d", "1540172295000": "\u201cMmmhhh.\u201d A rising murmur of doubt. \u201cYou\u2019ve not yet met those responsible for my safety. Not many are human. I think them sufficient, and I suspect Lust would agree.\u201dThe casual display of magic is not lost on Naoki, and in combination with the last thought, prompts her to reflect for a moment on the absurdity of the situation and her life in general. Here she is, with this thousands-of-years-old, well-dressed, doll-looking demon she just summoned from another plane of reality\u2014on her shoulder. For one so inept, so fragile as Naoki, sometimes the scale of the powers she plays with are terrifying, in an amusing way.\u201cI would presume, due to the excellent relationship we share, and in return for all the energy I provide her.\u201d Naoki isn\u2019t sure if Koitika is asking, or if she\u2019s about to tell her why.After considering for a moment, Naoki sets off down a hallway, headed for something, probably.\u201cHas Charyss told of the contract she and I share?\u201d", "1540922511000": "\u201cTo the bedroom,\u201d Naoki explains, rounding another corner. \u201cIt\u2019s down on the other end of this hallway.\u201d\u201cThe short version is such that I provide Charyss with an immense amount of power she wouldn\u2019t be able to obtain otherwise. In return, she allows me to borrow some of it for my own nefarious purposes, and does me certain other favors.\u201d A significant look toward Koitika implies that she is one of those favors.\u201cAnd, in the end, once I\u2019m finished in this world, my soul will join hers in the Circle of Lust. \u2026 And despite having sold my soul to a demon, I think it was a good deal,\u201d she muses, \u201cit isn\u2019t nearly as bad as it\u2019s often made out to be.\u201d", "1541383896000": "\u201cOh, you know I\u2019m looking forward to the demonstration,\u201d Naoki assures her, smirking. Within a few moments, they\u2019re at the door.Feb 26, 2016 20:05:18 GMT -8 Artemis said:The door opens\u00a0 into a large room with a high vaulted ceiling. A freestanding fireplace and multiple couches, chairs, and tables furnish the room; thick fur rugs line the floor in strategic places. The hues of the oak and cedar boards paneling the room are darker than in the rest of The Chalet, but lighter by several shades than the mahogany and dark oak scheme of the Midnight Sun. The walls are tastefully adorned with paintings. In one corner of the room sits an unusual furnishing - a tree. A quarter of the top portion of a mighty oak, where the branches start, has been felled, trimmed, treated, and placed in the corner. Thick limbs, stripped of bark and cured, run into the room, rising and spreading to meet the angles of the ceiling, where they are continued in a masterful mural depicting a view of the night sky from under a bare-limbed tree. Several forks and some of the more horizontal branches look like they would be particularly well suited to sitting on. Small magical lamps hang on strings draped among the branches, glowing and twinkling like little stars.There are five doors in the walls of this central room - three on the left wall, as viewed from the door, one on the right, and one on the far wall. The door in the right wall leads to the study. A line of windows along the far wall overlooks the lake and lets natural light into the room. Under the windows and continuing around the left wall of the room runs a single desk, books littered sporadically on its surface. The proper home of those books is with many of their fellows on the set of bookshelves running part of the right wall, next to a set of organizer shelves and boxes. A stand-alone circular fireplace occupies the middle of the room, along with several exceptionally comfortable-looking armchairs, two circular tables, and dark red upholstered chairs to go with them. Luxurious carpet covers the floor. The whole atmosphere is cozy and inviting, the perfect place to curl up with a book and watch the snow fall outside.The door in the far end of the common room leads to the bedroom, which is dominated by a large four-poster bed, hung with red velvet curtains that could easily fit four people. In the middle of the back wall, a large bay window, the shelf of which is large enough to sit in comfortably, provides a stunning panoramic view of the mountains, forest, and lake. The window is flanked on either side by a small fireplace flattening the corner of the room. The luxurious carpet from the study is duplicated in the bedroom. Paintings of various sizes adorn the walls, with the exception of one conspicuously bare spot. A small bookshelf, a table and two chairs, a wardrobe, and a dresser complete the room\u2019s furnishings. A door in the right wall of the bedroom leads to the bathroom. Done primarily in blue slate with dark paneled walls, the main feature of the bathroom is a tub that\u2019s very nearly large enough to swim in.There is a door in the right wall of the bedroom which is currently locked, although no keyhole is visible.Proceeding inside, Naoki is careful to make sure the door shuts all the way behind them. Disregarding the doors on the left and right, Naoki continues through the door on the far wall, into the bedroom. There, she makes a presenting gesture; this is the bedroom. ", "1541393160000": "Naoki nods. \u201cYes. I appreciate having a clean place to sleep.\u201d\u201cThe fun bed is through there,\u201d she adds, gesturing to the door without a handle. Though Naoki doesn\u2019t seem in much of a hurry to get there. Instead, she moves to sit on the edge of the bed. Entranced, she reaches toward the nearest of Koitika\u2019s tentacles but catches herself. \u201cDo you like to be touched?\u201d Naoki asks, fully aware of how that question sounds. Though one would think touching is implicit both ways in the master/tentacle familiar relationship, Naoki is taking it slow. Because despite the implicit power dynamic and Koitika\u2019s outward appearance, it\u2019s difficult for Naoki to forget that she\u2019s a thousands-of-years-old demon of significant power who\u2019s going to have opportunities to strangle her continually for the indefinite future. Suffice it to say, Naoki would rather spend the time to build a relationship based on mutual respect than join Charyss in The Hellscape sooner than she\u2019d like \u2014 even if it is a bit awkward here at first.", "1550464346000": "Naoki pauses, thinks for a moment, and nods in acceptance, raising her hands in mock-surrender. \u201cYes, that\u2019s fair. Forgive me for being overly cautious.\u201dIn answer to the question, she reaches for Koitika\u2019s tentacles. Taking one of the larger ones with both hands, Naoki strokes it, finding it smooth and characteristically warm to the touch. Taking another, she squeezes to gauge the turgidity. The suckers are, strangely enough, on the top rather than the underside. Examining one, Naoki rubs it gently with her thumb. Jokingly framing herself as something of a connoisseur, Naoki considers the widely ranging properties of tentacles. Even among demons of the same family, similarities seem almost coincidental. This is likely due to the fact that she deals primarily with high-level demons who have a great degree of control over themselves. Their \u201cproperties\u201d are likely whatever they choose that morning. Still, they all feel different, and one is led to wonder just what Koitika\u2019s tentacles feel like in comparison to others.The fondling continues as Naoki poses \u201cA  better question: what are your preferences? You implicitly feed on the lust of mortals, but you must have some favorites. \u2026 Intentionally open-ended.\u201d", "1552180123000": "\u201cI see,\u201d Naoki remarks, as one does when given information of that sort.Slowly, she nods. \u201cI agree; humanity certainly has erected all manner of cumbersome social conventions. Many of them are rooted in respect \u2014 and that\u2019s fine up until a point, but we truly have gone above and beyond to create such an elaborate set of unwritten rules.\u201d Extending her arms for inspection, Naoki allows Koitika to explore as she pleases.\u201cThis may be a good time to mention,\u201d she adds, almost apologetic, \u201cI\u2019m a reigning Empress. There\u2019s a great deal of that nonsense baked into most everything I do.\u201d ", "1553464798000": "Naoki exhales sharply and suppresses a chuckle. The term \u201cutterly ridiculous\u201d is an exceedingly applicable term, but with tentacles twining their way around near her neck, further thoughts about the bureaucracy are far from the forefront of her thinking.\u201cYou know what Mistress would like?\u201d she replies at a whisper, \u201cMistress would like to see what Kotika is capable of.\u201dPropelling herself all the way up onto the bed, Naoki puts on her characteristic sultry smirk. She's eager to see how Charyss's personal attendant will take her challenge, and by what merits she attained such a position. \u201cUse whatever form you\u2019d like, use your discretion, and try not to break me, as there are things to be done tomorrow.\u201d", "1572408638000": "A good handful of moments pass before Naoki opens the door, as she had misplaced her slippers. When she does, the winter chill sends a shiver down her tail and flattens her ears against the top of her head, prompting her to clutch at her robe and retreat behind the door.\u201cBack from your jaunt, then,\u201d she supposes, motioning for Grandma to hurry up and come in already so she can close the door and stop letting all the snow in.Naoki wastes no time in shutting the outside door and moving back through the interior one into the Chalet Proper, which is some fifty degrees warmer than the winter wonderland outside. After giving Grandma the opportunity to deposit garments in the vestibule, that door too is shut, and the sanctity of warmth is restored. \u201cYou could let yourself in, and that would also be fine,\u201d Naoki comments, dusting the snowflakes from her hair. She doesn\u2019t mind getting the door overly much, but it\u2019s awfully cold outside and pithy remarks make good filler.\u201cI was reading in the library,\u201d she says, starting in that direction. There\u2019s only one reason why Grandma would come, and chatting in the library is as good as anywhere else. \u201cHow was your \u2018trip\u2019?\u201d", "1572570055000": "Hearing that Grandma was successful, Naoki nods, pleased. She\u2019s learned not to ask after the details of what Grandma does on her little jaunts, it\u2019s only the result that is relevant to her. When presented with the material, Naoki leans over to get a better look but doesn\u2019t dare reach for it (that\u2019s another thing she\u2019s learned). It appears outwardly as merely a little nugget of stone or metal, but has that particular quality of eerieness to it \u2014 it\u2019s not from here. \u201cI hope it polishes well,\u201d Naoki supposes, continuing down the hallway. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t think I have any outfits that match that particular shade of abyssal black.\u201d\u201cWhile you were out, I was visited by one Captain O\u2019Malley, on behalf of her fledgling nation: Libertalia. \u2026 I liked her, she knows which way the wind blows and seems agreeable enough. Reminds me a bit of myself in the early days, if it were \u2018Captain\u2019 instead of \u2018Madame\u2019, were I more fierce, less articulate, with a heavier hand for punishment, and covered in tattoos. She seems to run her \u2018crew\u2019 in a manner not dissimilar to how I ran The Sun, and she has plenty of idealistic fantasies about freedom.\u201dChuckling to herself, Naoki pulls open the library door and leads the way inside. A large fire is crackling away merrily in the fireplace, but Naoki leads the way past it to an arrangement of desks. The largest central desk is larger than most beds and is, perhaps predictably, stacked with books. Many are green, several are open.\u201cI suppose we\u2019ll see how she turns out,\u201d Naoki continues, \u201cI\u2019ve acknowledged her nation and said I\u2019d buy some materials from her \u2026 But at the end she asked if I had ever seen these symbols before\u2026\u201dPulling the diagram given to her by O\u2019Malley from her robe, Naoki offers it to Grandma. It depicts four stylized sea creatures in the corners of the page and an octopus-adjacent sort of fellow smack in the middle.\u201cI was just having a peek though the material here and I found a few references that I think to be referring to her creatures, there, but nothing particularly substantial. As near as I\u2019ve been able to find, they\u2019re symbols of power from an ancient civilization that once existed down in the southern seas. But I suspect she already assumed as much as that, so I figured I\u2019d ask someone who would know.\u201d A significant look implies that Grandma is the one who would know.", "1573251822000": "Naoki\u2019s mouth (a thin line parallel to her furrowed eyebrows) slides from one side of her face to the other and back. She knows that Grandma isn\u2019t the sort for purely social visits. Still, Naoki was hoping that whatever matter Grandma wanted to discuss was, perhaps related to her recent trip, developments in any of their ongoing projects, foreign policy, or really anything at all less personal than the subject of succession.\u201cNot\u2026 overly,\u201d Naoki supposes, tucking the diagram back into her robe.\u201cIt\u2019s undoubtedly an important matter deserving of a great deal of thought \u2014 which I give it, but I\u2019ve explored the options as they exist right now,  and decided that I\u2019ll not be settling for half-measures or someone \u2018good enough\u2019. Before I vacate the throne, I will find, designate, train, and prepare my successor to precisely the extent I see fit. The feelers are out, the eyes are open, but the process, even just of finding them, will likely take years \u2014 as it probably should.\u201dTaking a seat opposite Grandma, Naoki kicks off her slippers, such that she might better feel the warmth of the fireplace on her feet. Slumped low in her chair, she's quiet for a long moment, staring into the fire with a blank expression.\u201cThe weight of the world \u2014 yes, weighs as heavily on my mind and soul as it ever has. The novelty has worn thin; I don\u2019t really want to be The Empress anymore. It\u2019s become tiring to look at just about anyone and reflect how they are, in many ways, freer than I \u2014 ruler of The Free City, to do as they please without consequence.\u201d\"But I can\u2019t leave the throne in good conscience because I am the source of Isra\u2019s current state of peace and prosperity. I am critical to the continued health of \u2014 it\u2019s millions, now \u2014 in the most literal sense. I would love to be able to travel the world and spend my days doing things of zero consequence whatsoever, but people would die, and I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s an exaggeration. The most my successor(s) will ever be able to do is make Isra\u2019s fall as slow and gentle as possible, and knowing all of this isn't exactly the most wonderful feeling I've ever experienced.\u201d\u201cBut you know this,\u201d Naoki continues, gesturing at Grandma, \u201cI know this, and in fact, most anyone with a clue probably has some idea of it. What prompts your question?\u201d", "1574136076000": "Naoki sits in silence as Grandma says her bit, her eyebrows growing steadily further apart. The words don\u2019t have as much of an impact on her as they may have been intended to \u2014 that day is as much now as it will ever be and her suspicion toward Grandma\u2019s motives is rising.\u201c...And how do you figure that?\u201d she asks. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be The Empress forever; I\u2019d like to do other things with my time. Seeing as how someone needs to be The Empress, and I\u2019d like it to be someone other than myself, I necessarily need to find a successor: someone to lead Isra after me.\u201d\u201cIf you\u2019re angling to suggest that I change myself or my \u2018perspective\u2019 to be a better Empress who can withstand the stresses and serve Isra indefinitely, I\u2019m going to laugh at you,\u201d Naoki adds, gesturing at Grandma, \u201cAs I\u2019m far too selfish for that.\u201d", "1574658395000": "Naoki remains nonplussed. \u201c... Yes, and how many methods to prevent, counteract, or reverse the process of aging do I have?\u201d She counts silently on her fingers. \u201cI can name four offhand,\u201d she says, holding up as many fingers. \u201cShould I wish to extend my life, the means are available to me \u2014 they have been for a long time. I believe that there\u2019s some unicorn blood just down in the lab, even.\u201dNaoki\u2019s attitude toward the subject is casual almost to the point of irreverence.

You\u2019re motivated by you and only you \u2014 your personal desire for power and knowledge and whatever else, and the only reason you do any of this is in pursuit of that.

The reason that I get up in the morning and do things is that I only have but so many mornings to do things with! Since my life is finite, it is my responsibility to do with it what I want. I am motivated by a sense of compassion for my fellow man, which is rooted in the idea that all of our collective lives are finite and we must work together to make them as good as we can. I am motivated by my sense of duty to the Isran people because I have assumed responsibility for their lives and it is thus my responsibility to do well by them,\" she continues. \"I desire power not for its own sake, but for the power to do as I\u2019d like with my life, and the lives of those I am responsible for.\u201d\u201cAll of these feelings are predicated on my being mortal \u2014 and that\u2019s why you don\u2019t feel them,\u201d Naoki continues, sticking one accusatory finger at Grandma. \u201cIf something were to happen to me, you would be upset not out of the compassion humans feel for one another, but because I was useful to you!\u201d She nearly spits.Then she catches herself. \u201c... Which is not to say that I harbor any ill-feelings against you,\u201d Naoki clarifies, aware of her tone. \u201cI continue to appreciate all that you have done, I mean no insult in saying any of this, apologize for taking that tone with you, don\u2019t hold who you are against you, and all of that.\u201d\u201cBut,\u201d She continues, sighing, \u201cThat\u2019s the way it is.\u201d\u201cAnd, respectfully, I don\u2019t want to be like you.

I know much of this entire thing is \u2018wrong\u2019 in some sense, but to become immortal would be a profoundly personal change that would destroy the foundation of my worldview, and for that reason, I hesitate.\u201dSighing heavily, Naoki looks off across the landscape. Her earlier anger is not gone, per se, but has been dampened by internal conflict and some amount of resignation. The best thing for the people of Isra would be for her to become immortal and rule indefinitely. Any successor would be inferior, and Isra would decline as a result. She doesn\u2019t want to for what is ultimately a selfish reason. ", "1586489867000": "Naoki stands stock still, staring straight ahead. She lets go of the breath she had been holding in a reluctant, stuttering exhale, not at all sure what\u2019s going on or what she\u2019s doing. Is Grandma allowed to do that? It\u2019s more than a little bit strange considering what she knows of Grandma, but Naoki\u2019s been running low on shoulders to cry on and it\u2019s any port in a storm....\u201cI\u2019m trying\u2026!\u201d she chokes out, now largely limp.\u201cI\u2019m doing weell,\u201d Naoki insists, grasping at the air behind Grandma\u2019s back.\u201cThe people\u2026 the people are happy and healthy and safe and fed! My word is law! I\u2019ve established a hegemony from scaps! My Empire is peerless throughout the world! I want for nothing but rest, what more is expected of me?!\u201d She\u2019s pleading, now. All of it is a little bit much, and it would be for anyone. Naoki cries for a bit more.\u201cThat\u2019s a lie,\u201d she eventually mumbles. \u201cI also want for a snack.

From here, if you can further improve relations, or establish some sort of formal alliance, by all means, do so. However, I am doubtful of the extent of this Queen\u2019s kingdom. If she is as she may seem to be, Queen of the Sea or the Ocean or what-have-you, her citizens are essentially fish. And though I mean no disrespect, I am doubtful of what manner of alliances one can establish with the fish. I suggest that you inquire as to the extent of her kingdom, what other sentient beings may or may not inhabit it, and what you and the people of Isra may be able to do to assist her in whatever business it is that she attends to. You\u2019ve already pacified a terrifying foe; if you can earn us a powerful ally, by all means, go right ahead.\u201d", "1560548077000": "Having stowed her things, The Empress emerges onto the top deck of The Indulgence and breathes in the salty ocean air. \"Ah! To sail.\" Sailing is always something that has appealed to Naoki in a manner of speaking. That is, she enjoys sailing as an experience, but not as a verb.Luckily, she has come to employ The one and only Captain Gothmog Bloodsail; who presumably enjoys sailing and is quite good at it. Even though The Empress is the highest authority, Gothmog is the commanding officer\u2014meaning that he does the work. The responsibility is entirely his.Which means the responsibility of managing this and the other ships does not belong to Naoki, and\u2014because they're at sea, her regular set of duties also do not belong to her, having been given to Consul FinchIt follows that she doesn't have any particular responsibilities right now. ...This is unprecedented. Naoki blinks. Never before has she had someone to pass the reigns to, someone else to carry the weight of the world so she could rest. She worries for Liz as much as she usually does for herself and more, but ultimately, Liz is well-equipped, well-informed, and Naoki trusts her to supervise The Empire in her absence.But no responsibilities! Until they reach Edan, her only duty is to be a passenger! What a feeling, it's incredible! Standing on the deck, Naoki wears a sly little grin as she considers the idea that the shackles are off. She has absolute freedom to do as she'd like! ... On this ship. Though the shackles are off, she's now in a cell. A lavish, upholstered cell with a library, sauna, and plenty of large beds, but a cell nonetheless.Bah! Naoki dismisses the thought, eager to take advantage of her newfound freedom. She could read, there are plenty of books.She could write, there's much to be written. Or, she could go speak with someone. There's the Company officer, Ravenholdt. She looked like fun. But from the rear of the ship, Naoki can still see the port. She has to pace herself. Gothmog and the others do have duties to attend to, so she will speak with Deidra, Naoki decides. They have much to discuss and she was looking forward to the voyage for that reason. Returning belowdecks, Naoki sets out to find Deidra Nofal\u00f3. It shouldn't take long, she thinks to herself; it isn't a very big ship.", "1560742515000": "\u201cWell,\u201d Naoki begins, eyeing Gundulf, \u201cAdmittedly, I can\u2019t do very much about the cat thing.\u201dFrom her position a few feet away, Naoki extends her open hand for Gundulf to come sniff or ignore as it suits him.\u201cBut! What I\u2019ve come to suggest is that you join me in my quarters for tea and cookies. There\u2019s much for us to discuss and I probably shouldn\u2019t eat all the cookies myself.\u201dGesturing, she invites Deidra\u2014and her friend to follow her just down the hall.", "1560789396000": "Naoki holds still and allows Gundul to sniff her. In doing so, she intends to introduce herself and express goodwill. Offers a small smile, unbothered by his suspicion. If it is his duty to protect Deidra he has every reason to be suspicious of her, and she doesn\u2019t fault him for it. Trust is only earned in time, starting now.The interior of Naoki\u2019s cabin is somewhat dull in comparison to some of her other living spaces, but the height of luxury as personal quarters go. Opposite the door, a large, four-poster bed stretches from floor to ceiling, neatly made, curtains open. On the left, there is a row of portholes that look out the starboard side of the hull, with cabinets above and below.  A large carpet of exotic make covers most of the floor, and unlit sconces are mounted all around at regular intervals. On the right, shipbuilders have managed to finagle an entire fireplace into the room, complete with tools, mantle, protective grating, and a little stack of firewood. It is not yet lit, but this is what Naoki sets about doing, gesturing for Deidra to seat herself in one of the chairs that sit facing it. Between the chairs, there is a small table, and upon the table, a tray of tea and cookies has been set. If not for the portholes and the gentle rocking of the ship, one would be forgiven in thinking themselves in a cozy little one-room cabin nestled up in the mountains\u2014albeit a rather affluent one. \u201cCozy\u201d is certainly the keyword.Kneeling in front of the fire, Naoki fiddles with the firestarter. It seems as though she knows what she\u2019s doing; it\u2019s just taking a bit.Glancing over her shoulder, Naoki asks what she thinks to be a fairly innocuous question: \u201cWhat manner of ship did you leave Edan on?\u201d ", "1560986131000": "\u201cHmmh!\u201d Naoki murmurs acknowledgment as the fireplace bursts into flame.

She slots her tail through the purpose-made hole in her chair, wiggles a little bit to settle in, and sighs\u2014 comfortable.\u201cI enjoy a good fire,\u201d she muses, pausing to blow on her tea. \u201cIt crackles and pops in that way that it does, is good for staring into, and\u2014if you use the right wood, can smell pleasant. This is cedar,\u201d Naoki gestures with her cup.", "1561161379000": "\u201cWell. If you are an actor, you have my most sincere compliments.\u201d Naoki smirks. The sarcasm is heavy but well-intentioned.\u201cBut consider from my point of view.\u201d She gestures as if to lay out the scene.\u201cA tall, striking woman comes into my throne room and claims to be the princess of some place I\u2019ve never heard of. \u2026 This is a somewhat frequent occurrence, people coming and claiming to be someone important. Generally, my policy is to give them the benefit of the doubt, because to immediately question someone\u2019s identity would, of course, start the conversation off on a bad foot and be highly disrespectful, besides. In most cases, the staff is able to verify before they get to me, but I digress.\u201d She gestures to set the scene again. \u201cSo she\u2019s standing there in her armor, with what was quite obviously a high-grade familiar,\u201d Naoki nods toward Gundulf. \u201cAnd she spins me a tale of a magical land hidden in The Mists, where a whole mess of realms manage by some miracle to function together as a cohesive state. It was a good story and I could go on about why it was convincing and how she carried herself and so on, but ...\u201dA pause. \u201cIn addition to that, I was told who you were before you came in.\u201d \u201cMy assistant \u2014 you saw her there on the chair, also claims to be from Edan. Coincidentally and among other things, she manages my visitors. That morning when reviewing the list, she pointed you out as someone of note. In the ensuing conversation, she told me of Edan and what she knew of you\u2014which was hardly anything.\u201d\u201cAnd seeing as how your story matched up with hers\u2026\u201d Trailing off, Naoki gestures with her palm up. It all made sense to her, and even if she doubted Deidra, she wouldn\u2019t have \"thrown her out.\"", "1561351165000": "Naoki blinks back over the rim of her teacup. Did Deidra assume that she had been taking her on her word this whole time? All the way out to sea? Being complimented for thinking through actions before she takes them is like being applauded for dressing herself in the morning. There are probably leaders who don\u2019t, but it shouldn\u2019t be strange that she does.The perception of \u201cmainlanders\u201d or whatever the term may be in Edan must not be very good. If they\u2019ve been watching this portion of the Overworld since the end of the Cataclysm... that makes a lot of sense, Naoki supposes. But are expectations going to be this low in Edan, among those who have never seen Isra? Will she and her entourage be treated as simpletons by the \u201cCouncil?\u201d Naoki hopes that she\u2019s reading too far into it. Naoki dips her head in hesitant acceptance of what she thinks to be intended as a compliment and reaches for a cookie. She expected more of a response for having told the entire truth in mentioning Koitika, but isn\u2019t going to push the matter.\u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a long story,\u201d she begins. \u201cWhy I employ demons \u2026 I\u2019ll tell it if you\u2019d like, but the short of it, in her case, is such that she\u2019s one component of a deal I struck with the Demonlady Of Lust some time ago. I\u2019m very happy with the deal \u2014 it\u2019s surprisingly equitable for what it is, and I\u2019m very happy with her performance. 'Koitika', is her name, and she\u2019s terribly good at what she does. Having her as my administrative assistant is wonderful. She can write more quickly than I can, take notes, make copies, keep track of my lists\u2026\u201d Naoki gestures onward, implying more as she sips her tea.\u201cI keep the pages around for tradition, but\u2026\u201d She shrugs. They\u2019re really not necessary. ", "1562033017000": "Confusion fades to defeat as Naoki slumps back in her seat, sighing.\u201cYou didn\u2019t offend me,\u201d she has to explain. \u201cMy ego is not so fragile that it can be hurt inadvertently. If you want to offend me, you\u2019ll need to do so purposefully, and if you succeed, I\u2019ll be sure to say as much.\u201d\u201cAs for the topic, I\u2026\u201d She trails off in search of words. \u201cI don\u2019t have anything specific. ... I just want to talk to someone,\u201d Naoki admits, gesturing in frustration. \u201cYou\u2019re the only person around for miles who isn\u2019t directly beholden to my will, and I hoped that here, in this informal setting, with the tea and the cookies and the cozy little fire \u2014 that we could speak as equals.\u201dSipping her tea bitterly, Naoki doesn\u2019t make eye contact, preferring instead to stare into the fire. What is implied but not said is \u201cseemingly not.\u201d Because it seems like even here, to offend the Empress would be \u2018dangerous.\u2019 \u201cI suppose I should have led with that,\u201d Naoki adds, softening.

Making decisions with wide-reaching effects can only be done well with knowledge of the world, and your travels \u2014 and the experiences you must have had, will doubtlessly make you a more capable ruler.\u201d Nodding toward Deidra as she takes a bite of her cookie, Naoki indicates respect.\u201cThey\u2019ll probably make for good stories, as well,\u201d she adds, gesturing with her half-cookie.", "1562558734000": "Naoki nods all-too-knowingly, reflecting on her own (all but sedentary) life. \u201cIt\u2019s a gilded cage, rulership.

Unfamiliar with Edan\u2019s unorthodox style of bureaucracy, Naoki is unaware of what power the \u2018council\u2019 might hold over Deidra and how their proceedings and power dynamics play out.\u201cWhat do you mean?

As long as I don\u2019t scare them it ought to be alright, and I\u2019ll admit: being scary is not something I do particularly well.\u201d Sitting there in front of the fire, nibbling on her cookie, wearing her knitted sweaterdress, Naoki (fuzzy ears and soft tail included) employs a heavy degree of tounge-in-cheek humor.\u201cThe worst plausible scenario is such that I say something snarky, offend the wrong person, and sail home empty-handed.\u201d Naoki shrugs, unconcerned.

Drumming her fingers on the rug, she considers. Theoretically, there\u2019s much to tell, but being put on the spot like so... nothing jumps to mind.\u201cI can\u2019t say that I have a favorite pastry,\u201d she begins, still thinking. \u201cI\u2019ll have to consider that. \u2026 But I can\u2019t stand fish.\u201d\u201cSome would think, \u2018Oh, she looks like a cat, she must like fish!\u2019 but no. No no no, let me tell you this story:\u201dGesturing with one hand, she sets the scene. \u201cAt one point, years ago, before Isra, before The Free City was even founded, in some fledgling town who-knows-where... I was hungry.\u201d \u201c\u2026 Difficult to believe, but true. I was hungry, and there was this fish. I\u2019ll not go into how we obtained the fish but suffice it to say: there was this fish.\u201d Naoki indicates a size of about three feet. \u201cThere was this great big fish, and it was the most appetizing fish you\u2019d ever seen. It was a sort of a pale green-blue color, and it smelled like nothing else. It was\u2026 fishy, but also somehow very tasty-smelling, mouth-watering, even. It was unique, it was strange. It was strange, and we recognized it was strange at the time, but we were hungry. So we cooked it over our little fire, and then we ate it.\u201dShe pauses to sip her tea. \u201cYou can probably see where this is going. We ate our fill (it tasted divine), and then went to bed with little smiles and filled tummies.\u201dNaoki is quiet for a few moments. The next bit is not among her favorite memories. \u201c... But we did not sleep that night. I\u2019ll spare you the details but that was the sickest I\u2019ve ever been; it was the worst. Luckily, it passed in a few days, but I\u2019m fortunate to have survived; it was bad.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not sure what it was exactly, but in hindsight, that was definitely not a mundane fish. Someone\u2019s idea of a cruel joke, or perhaps it was poisoned \u2026 And while I\u2019m consciously aware that regular fish are by-and-large quite safe to eat, the smell still reminds me of that one, so I don\u2019t partake of fish.\u201d", "1564428828000": "\u201cGo ahead,\u201d Naoki waves her on, grinning. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t want you to laugh, I wouldn\u2019t have told the story.\u201d Chuckling to herself, Naoki smirks, pleased for having made Deidralaugh.After they\u2019ve recomposed themselves, Naoki responds. \u201c... Yes, I suppose I did \u2018travel with people.\u2019 That\u2019s a very polite way to put it, thank you.\u201d She nods in jesting thanks.\u201cBut I wasn\u2019t quite mature at that point,\" she continues, \"and I didn\u2019t necessarily have any particular location to return to after traveling.\u201d\u201cI was a vagrant,\u201d Naoki spells outright. \u201cAnd the fish was stolen from a fishmonger. It certainly isn't among the best parts of my life, but at this point, it\u2019s so long ago that it's essentially irrelevant. I hardly remember it, even.\u201d The tone of her voice suggests that Naoki isn't ashamed or remorseful per se, but it also isn\u2019t some she\u2019s proud of. She doesn't advertise the fact, certainly. Returning to the first question: \u201cBut \u2018who is we?\u2019 \u2026\u201d Trailing off, Naoki sighs.\u201cIt's a long story.\u201d she says, \u201cThe short version of which is such that there once was someone I traveled with, but who I do not travel with any longer.\u201d\u201cNot out of want, but by circumstance...\" she hesitantly elaborates. \u201cThey don\u2019t function anymore. They haven\u2019t died, per se, but to go much further here would be to launch into the specifics of my past, and indeed, I think there are more currently relevant things we could discuss right now.\u201dAs such, Naoki leaves the metaphorical door open for Deidra to steer the conversation. If she\u2019d like to press that\u2019s fine, but Naoki isn\u2019t so rude as to launch into an expository monologue unprompted.", "1579644663000": "[Enter from The Free Docks]The Indulgence\u2019s prow is as a golden blade cutting through the water -- swiftly and effortlessly, leaving a great wake in its trail.

At the ship\u2019s bow, just behind the golden figurehead cast in her image, Naoki herself leans against the railing. The maroon sweaterdress she chose for Finances Day contrasts sharply with both the pale blue of the afternoon sky and The Indulgence\u2019s polished wood. What hair isn\u2019t tied back flaps wildly in the breeze, but it doesn\u2019t seem as though she minds that or the occasional misting she receives from waves breaking on the hull.

Soon enough, The Indulgence slows from its breakneck pace to a speed that is not slow, but certainly more reasonable. Accordingly, the breeze in their face slows, as does the rocking of the ship, and the frequency with which waves splash up onto the deck.Seeing this, Naoki nods, satisfied. She looks back to Keph and steps closer to put a comforting hand on his head. \u201cThe worst you\u2019ll get is a bit damp,\u201d she assures him. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be here if it wasn\u2019t safe.\u201d\u201cBut there\u2019s no particular reason for us to be up here in any case.

Offhandedly, as though nothing strange were going on, she details a strange occurrence she witnessed touring the city some days prior. There is little substance to what she says, it\u2019s utterly inconsequential, but the alternative would be to walk in silence and let the waves unnerve Keph further, so she talks. She pauses only for a moment to address a page: The Empress requests that he prepare a particular sort of tea \u2014 and bring a bucket when he comes.The interior of Naoki\u2019s cabin is somewhat dull when compared to some of her other living spaces, but far surpasses the standards of what one might expect to find in even a captain\u2019s quarters. On the right, master shipwrights have by some miracle managed to finagle an entire fireplace into the room, complete with tools, mantle, protective grating, and a little stack of firewood.

Upon it, two comfy chairs sit facing the fireplace with a small table between them. If not for the portholes and the gentle rocking of the ship, one would be forgiven in thinking themselves in a cozy little one-room cabin nestled up in the mountains. Perhaps a highly affluent cabin, but a cabin nonetheless, with \u2018cozy\u2019 being the operative word.Naoki leads Keph over to the nearer of the two chairs as the door clicks shut behind them. \u201cIt\u2019s safe here. \u2026 You want to sit?\u201d Craning her neck around, she tries to get a look at Keph\u2019s face.

We have options.\u201d \u201cOption one is the easy and safe option: you carry on sitting right there. Until you\u2019re well, or until we figure something better.\u201d\u201cNumber two,\u201d she continues, leaning over to whisper in Keph\u2019s ear, \u201cIs an option you may find... appealing. I could, as you well know, give you\u2026 better things to think about.\u201d Her breath on his neck is warmer than it has any right to be. \u201cI could distract you, become the center of your attention, the center of your world, and make you feel better whether you like it or not \u2014 but you very much will.\u201dNaoki pulls away, and the heat subsides. \u201cWhich, admittedly, has been in the cards regardless, but I am not opposed to moving it forward in the schedule if you think that would help. \u2026 You\u2019ll have to keep those apples in for that, though,\u201d she adds, wagging a cautionary finger.\u201cNumber three is the clever option,\u201d she continues. \u201cOption three is that we partake of a gentle sleeping potion and have a little catnap. By the time you wake up, you will have grown used to the sea and be well. \u2026 Hopefully. If not, we\u2019ll try something else.\u201d\u201cOption four is that we turn the ship around and go home, and number five is any idea you may have. If you know what would help, please tell me.\u201d An earnest ask. The last choice she presented Keph with isn\u2019t panning out as well as all that, but those are the best ideas she has, and she doesn\u2019t often have the luxury of delegating the final choice.", "1589068898000": "\u201cVery well,\u201d Naoki replies, entirely prepared for that answer. \u201cYou sit here,\u201d she instructs him.She\u2019s out into the hall and back within a minute or two, as the page was waiting outside. Naoki has eschewed the niceties of a proper tea set for merely two cups. She places these on the table between the chairs and proceeds over to the bedside table. There, she pulls a bottle from the drawer and checks its label. There\u2019s a cabinet full of potions (and poisons) just to her right, but this particular mix has earned that position of dubious honor.Slowly making her way back over, Naoki double, triple checks the label, pulls the cork and sniffs carefully. She has no reason to suspect anyone has been tampering with her things, but apparent double suicide by poison with some vagrant boy out on her yacht would be a hell of a way for The Empress to go, and Naoki\u2019s not going there today. Satisfied, she returns to Keph and sets upon the teacups.\u201cA little sedative never hurt anyone\u2026\u201d Naoki mumbles, raising the teacup to eye level as she carefully drips in one, exactly two drops. \u201cIt\u2019s concentrated.\u201d\u201cConcentrated,\u201d she says, taking the other cup, \u201cBut gentle and relatively slow acting. We\u2019ll have time to lie down and think for a bit before it gets us.\u201d The second cup also gets two drops and is offered to Keph. Naoki takes the first, raises it in perfunctory toast, and, pending any disasters, begins to drink. ", "1592791204000": "The bottle is returned to the nightstand and the cup to its tray. As Keph is drinking, Naoki exchanges her sweaterdress for a nightgown and ensures that the door and windows are shut. Shuffling around the room barefoot, she extinguishes all the candles and draws the curtains shut before taking the bucket from its place by the chair and joining Keph at the bed.Scattering his accessories this way and that earns the back of Keph\u2019s head a disapproving glare from Naoki. He\u2019ll be made to pick all that up later, but for now she can\u2019t be bothered.\u201cHere.\u201d She passes him the bucket. \u201cIf not in there, aim for the floor over the sheets and definitely avoid the pillows.\u201dIt\u2019s still only late afternoon, it\u2019ll be a few hours yet before the sun sets. As the ship rocks, the curtains sway, occasionally illuminating particles of dust and casting beams of light on the opposite wall. All is quiet save for the sound of waves against the hull, and all said, it\u2019s quite peaceful. \u201cThis is pleasant,\u201d Naoki remarks, donning her sleep mask. \u201cI always feel better after a nap, hopefully, you will as well.\u201d With that she settles in, sliding down into the blanket, pulling up the covers, and shuffling over to wrap an arm around Keph \u2014 carefully. She\u2019s asleep within a minute or so.", "1596593988000": "On his way out the door, Keph only makes it a few paces down the hall before encountering not just one, but a pair of page boys of similar age and build to himself. They\u2019re meandering down the corridor, looking sharp in their matching tunics, carrying on a conversation between themselves. Their shift just ended, and they were on their way back to their quarters before The Empress\u2019s door creaks open in front of them. They snap to attention, but it\u2019s not The Empress \u2014 it\u2019s her \u2018Guest\u2019, looking a bit bedraggled. They stand silently and watch as Keph scribbles his message, and nod in unison upon reading it. \u201cCertainly, milord. We were on our way to the mess anyway. I believe it\u2019s stew tonight \u2014 unless you would prefer something else?\u201d But the Guest is already back inside.  Looking between themselves, the pageboys suppose they can\u2019t blame him. They turn around and set off toward the mess hall with purpose, fully intending to pass this task along to the next shift. Naoki, for her part, rolls over. The tip of her tail twitches beneath the blanket and A few minutes pass before there\u2019s a knock on the door, four in quick succession. It\u2019s a different pair of page boys, who have come with a little cart full of foodstuffs. There\u2019s not a page-boy-protocol for accepting tasks from The Empress\u2019s guest, as The Empress doesn\u2019t usually have guests. The cooks were singularly confused to hear of the first two\u2019s encounter, and so decided just to send over a selection of The Empress\u2019s preferred items they can whip up relatively quickly.As such, the cart contains two bowls of the aforementioned stew, a tray of biscuits, a small platter of grapes, a box of fancy chocolates, a bowl of mixed nuts, a kettle of something piping hot, a few wines to choose between, two trays of hors d'oeuvres, a small pie, a tray of cheese and bread, \u2014 and some apples, seeing as how Her Guest had requested apples earlier. (The cart isn\u2019t actually very little at all. It takes up much of the hallway.)The pages are at an impasse. Usually, The Empress would direct them, but she\u2019s... not here? Perhaps indecent, just out of view\u2026?They don\u2019t dare to enter without invitation, and as such look to Keph, prompting. He has the reins, they will do more or less as he asks.", "1516147217000": "The Eldruin Mountains are the definition of cold and unforgiving. They harbor exactly zero inhabitants. They are empty. Devoid of minerals, lacking treasure. All that exists to be found in The Eldruin Mountains is snow and rock, interspersed with the occasional frozen lake or smattering of dead trees. No roads, no paths, no settlements, no ruins, absolutely\u00a0nothing of the sort. This is wilderness, wild, untamed, and untouched.", "1531103978000": "From one of the carriages, The Empress emerges. For this occasion, she is wearing what else but one of her signature sweaterdresses. This one is bright red, featuring a turtleneck and golden ornamentation.Gesturing for those assembled to go about their business, she stretches, sore from the long ride.Coming around to the end of the carriage, The Empress looks to the city. All the way out here, across The Expanse, beyond the Saskatoon Mountains, is Salem. It seems pleasant enough from this angle. Someone goes to great lengths to make it so\u2014you can\u2019t even see the slums.Gesturing to her retinue, The Empress starts for the city, carefully, as not to dirty her shoes.", "1531104072000": "\u201cMmmh,\u201d The Empress considers for a moment. \u201cI should hope that the invitation list isn\u2019t terribly long. There are a great many \u2018nobles\u2019 scattered about who have little more than a title to their name and no influence to speak of. I have nothing against polite dining partners, but I do not wish to be petitioned by the likes of them.\u201dHer first visit to Gauldin as an ambassador comes to mind.A few moments pass quietly before Naoki continues, \u201cI have heard tell of a Velmerys Imperium; The Duchess said that she would be inviting their queen. I should wish to make their acquaintance in a setting such as this. \u2026 It\u2019s been some time since I\u2019ve seen Lord Crovan. That\u2019s due only to my own inaction, but even so. Similarly, the Land Tiller elders.\u201dAs they proceed down the avenue, The Empress pauses to admire the architecture. Isran architecture, while respectable in its way, is essentially a hodgepodge of the styles and cultures that make the city\u2019s population. The opposite is true here, the theme, uniform as it is, is interesting.  \u201cAnd,\u201d she continues. \u201cIt will be interesting to see who comes from across the sea. The feast is but a single night; committing to weeks of travel\u2026\u201d She trails off. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t.\u201d", "1531271579000": "\u201cAdrian.

Congratulations!\u201dAdrian\u2019s standing with The Empress is somewhat spotty. He served Isra as a commander for a time, but that ended in a debacle involving a large magical explosion, the destruction of a keep, and the deaths of his men. It was far from an honorable discharge, and she found his explination of the matter lacking, but she respects that it probably wasn\u2019t his intention to cause such a mess. This earns him half-sarcasm.\u201cI can only imagine how you must be relishing the joys of fatherhood,\u201d she says, reaching out to give Adrian an awkward clap on the shoulder. \u201cGive them my regards; I\u2019ll see you at the feast.\u201dWith this, a parting nod, and a small gesture to her entourage, The Empress continues into the city, walking in no particular direction other than in.", "1528936841000": "Flying in from the north comes a magnificent sight, as-of-yet unseen by the eyes of peasants. It is The Empress Naoki, all but glowing in her full battle regalia, atop her majestic steed, Haru  . Atop her staff, The Gems of Croeria hum faintly with barely-restrained power. In her other hand, there is a pair of elegant opera glasses, trained on the ground below.Below, as she was told, there seems to be some sort of altercation. There certainly are a goodly handful of burly metal-types... Almost reminiscent of Inspector Zurt  . Perhaps some of his southern cousins. Many beards... There seems to be a duel, there, as well.Something about the glasses, though... Irritated, she attempts to adjust the focus.", "1529042144000": "It is with some measure of disgust that The Empress notices one of the commonfolk flying up toward her. The idea of flying so high in the sky is such that she would be up here, and they would stay down there\u2014where they belong. Evidently, this bloody rube didn\u2019t get the memo.Evidently, he\u2019s also one of the uneducated, unprivileged few who does not know who she is. (This is how Naoki can tell that they\u2019re in the deep south.)Wordlessly, The Empress reaches into the pouch on her hip and pulls out a handful of glimmering gold coins. With the kind of skillful aim that can come only from practice, she pelts Ozrith with them as he flies up toward her.The coins, are, of course, printed with her face. \"EMPRESS NAOKI,\" they read, and upon the reverse is the crest of The Isran Empire. The same crest is emblazoned on the shoulders of her armor, and if he is of paticularly keen sight, Ozrith may be able to read \"Naoki\" in delicate script down the side of her arm.", "1529385283000": "The Empress looks down upon the smartass with scorn and genuine confusion. What did he mean to accomplish by that? It would be wrong to say that she was looking forward to trying out her new staff\u2014that would be cruel, but she can appreciate being given such an excellent justification to let loose.Gripping her staff in one hand, The Empress begins to channel its power, cautiously at first. At its tip, the amber gemstone known as \u201cthe air gem\u201d begins to glow, as all magical gemstones do when being used. The air around the gemstone thrums with barley-restrained power, and Naoki is careful to keep a good grip on the staff.Around them in a wide area, the wind begins to kick up. It seems that \u201cthe air gem\u201d is exercising control over\u2014wouldn\u2019t you know it, the air, whipping a bit of a vortex around Ozrith. The vortex gains strength with each passing second, and may make flying with physical wings somewhat difficult.", "1529716169000": "The Empress scoffs. The imprudence, the presumption of this boy. It\u2019s impressive, his capacity for ignorance. All who criticize her are wise enough to do so behind closed doors\u2014all save for this boy.Unamused, The Empress allows more mana to flow from the staff, strengthening the vortex. It grows in size and speed, exerting a suction. Where it touches the ground, a great cloud of sand has been whipped up from the force of wind hitting the ground, like blowing on an anthill.The staff is not complex; it serves to shape energy from the gems and little more effectively. It has little capacity for precision, but incredible strength. Disrupting the staff\u2019s magic in any significant capacity would likely require the application of powerful magics to the staff itself.", "1530060183000": "The Empress\u2019s vortex has grown now to a raging tempest, stretching all the way down to the ground, some thousands of feet below. It spins with incredible, unnatural speed, fueled by the staff\u2019s near-limitless reserve of magic, guided by The Empress\u2019s hand. The \u201cpulse\u201d passes below notice, noted only as a momentary pause in the growth of the storm.Seeing Ozrith attempting escape, The Empress directs the storm to mimic his movements, aiming to keep him within. Such is the beauty of things of such grand scale: it\u2019s difficult to miss. The vortex is some distance away from the battle, but even there the wind whips, kicking up sand into the eyes of soldiers. It is only through her focused command of the winds and much effort on Haru\u2019s part that The Empress is not drawn in as well.", "1530152011000": "Watching the hands connect, The Empress smirks beneath her helmet. Then, she is surprised to feel a sudden spark of pain; a small part of Ozrith\u2019s spell made it through the protections on her armor. She\u2019s distracted for a moment, but recovers. Then, as Grandma sets loose the chains, Naoki slings a spell of her own. From the tip of the staff, a stream of flames emerges. The Empress points it toward the tempest, where it is absorbed. After only a few moments, the entire storm is set ablaze, roaring with ravenous, stygian flames. Even through her armor, Naoki feels the heat. ", "1530244423000": "From over among the rabble, someone shouts something. The Empress doesn\u2019t quite hear it over the roaring of the vortex, but she files it as a note for later.Raging and roaring, the tornado spins on. The fire of the vortex heats the chains, turning their silvery sheen to a red-hot glow. The sand being thrown in is vitrified in small clumps, sending shards of glass spinning every which way.The Empress directs Haru to move away from the tempest, out into the open sky. There, from a safe distance, she channels still more power from the fire gem, further intensifying the heat. Hotter than a smith\u2019s forge, hotter than dragon\u2019s breath, it\u2019s almost as hot as Naoki. Beneath her helmet, she smirks.", "1530398246000": "The Empress, who didn\u2019t hear any manner of summons what for the huge, roaring fire-tornado, is somewhat surprised to see whatever this is appear and fly toward her.Did she pray to it? \u201cNo,\u201d she says, at a normal speaking volume.It looks like a demon. A demon with a lot of pointy-bits. Naoki wonders sarcastically to herself if he\u2019s come to make a deal but somehow doubts that. She remains where she is. If it continues to approach, she would need to do something, but there\u2019s still a fair bit of distance between them.", "1530483709000": "Did the boy pray? Naoki is willing to take Grandma\u2019s word for it, and content to have Grandma between her and it.She places one hand on the back of Haru\u2019s head, steadying him, eyes still on the demon. ", "1530680924000": "The Empress glances over toward where Ozrith was, then to the demon. She huffs in retort and takes a swig from her flask.  It\u2019s too early in the day for demons, but not too early to start hitting the bottle. He certainly does seem like a demon to her.Obviously a rage demon, due to his immense hatred for whoever brought him into this world looking like that.Regardless, The Empress tires of these interruptions. She came for entertainment, and she was met with this. First the braggadocious boy, and now this demon, with an ego bigger than he is, and that oh-so-fashionable skull codpiece. (Though the black nail polish is a nice touch.)Though, between the two of them, Corn and the boy, Naoki isn\u2019t sure which one boasts the more massive ego. Perhaps it would be a good idea to stitch the boy back together so the two of them could compare.\u201cI heard that those hairy people down there were blaspheming you,\u201d she says, gesturing with her flask to the assembled armies of Iskaldur and Immortals on the desert sands far below.", "1531017131000": "As Grandma is speaking, it clicks. This is who Venus was talking about when she mentioned her big brother with the nefarious intentions. The resemblance is there, in the spikes. This is who\u2019s interested in the Overworld for its relics; this is the one who would kill children. And he\u2019s angry because Naoki fucked his sister.Well. He\u2019s probably angry just in general, but especially so about that, it seems.Putting the flask away, The Empress reaches into the pouch on her hip. With some difficulty due to the gauntlet, she removes a green gemstone resembling a small egg and holds it in her fist.\u201cThat\u2019s a rather personal question,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd no business of yours.\u201d", "1531193190000": "\u201cMmmhhh\u2026\u201d The Empress considers for a moment.

For what it\u2019s worth, I quite enjoyed spending time with Venus; it was much more enjoyable than this conversation. So if you\u2019ll excuse me\u2014\u201dFrom the gem in her fist, there is a momentary flash of greenish light. Then The Empress, and Haru with her are gone. Teleported away to parts unknown.", "1532831731000": "Before entering the hall, The Empress gestures for her Sentinels to remain outside. She makes two beckoning motions, one somewhat towards Iulia\u2019s left, and a second most certainly directed at Iulia herself. The now much smaller group heads into the feast.Again, much effort has been spent on the aesthetic of the feast hall. From the city to the castle, right down to the amount of water in each glass, everything is immaculate. There\u2019s not a missing button to be seen among the servants, no frayed shirt tails,  all of the flowers are in perfect bloom, and the knights have evidently polished their armor for the occasion. Though she supposes that she may be reading too far into it, the state of the decor leads Naoki to wonder in what manner the servants were threatened. She makes a mental note to see about poaching the staff responsible later.In any case, it seems some of the heads of state have already arrived. There\u2019s Shintaro, along with someone who by all indications would be Tawakoshi\u2019s leader. Both of whom seem to have brought their wives, and both of whom seem to have already presented gifts to the hosts. It is at this point that Lady Naoki begins to think that perhaps she ought to have brought a gift, and perhaps she ought to have considered the implications of bringing Iulia in the manner that she has. Precedent does her no favors today. Regardless, the lack of assigned seating is an interesting choice by the hosts. And if they\u2019re not going to, Lady Naoki opts not to put much thought into where she sits, glad not to be troubled with that particular minutia of formality. With a finger-wiggling wave to those already in attendance, The Empress seats herself near the middle of the table. Surreptitiously, she then replaces one of her glasses with a black ceramic mug. She isn\u2019t quite so adventurous as to eat just whatever Servant Schmuckatelli places before her, but she doesn\u2019t mean to make a scene of it. The extra glass would mysteriously arrive in front of Iulia later in the evening.This done, she sits quietly, curious to see who else may yet arrive. If this is the extent of the guest list, she would feel bad for the servants who were made to set all these places.", "1533416347000": "Empress Naoki twitches her ears in a slightly irritated manner. Who decided that Iulia could come? A better question, is she attempting to commit career suicide, sabotage international relations, or does she simply lack for a single shred of tact?Mentioning a \u201cdeep vengeful streak,\u201d telling them \u201cnot to mention the ears,\u201d and beguiling foreign leaders with poorly-founded conspiracy stories about the Imperial Emblem. Honestly. It leads one to wonder what the Foreign Service is doing with their budget. Later, there will be Words.", "1533604260000": "With each new development, Naoki\u2019s eyebrows rise progressively higher up her forehead. She had been counting it being an exciting evening, but Duke Konrad has surpassed expectations. A coup, complete with murder of the Vessian official. Unnecessary. Just as well they could have imprisoned him, but Konrad ordered him killed. Two bolts for two eyes, even. Spicy. Perhaps Count Ulrich wronged Konrad in the past\u2014she can\u2019t know, but it was still a statement. He certainly has made a statement, Konrad, and for that, she must applaud him in a figurative sense. In an outward sense, The Empress\u2019s reaction is neutral. She watches but does not comment. Only once Konrad and Audrey are seated does she address them. \u201cBravo, that was quite the show. It must have been long in the making.\u201d After receiving a glass of wine, she raises it briefly in their direction. \u201cBut why dissolve The Brotherhood? They\u2019ve done much, and seem to be fairly important to your city.\u201d She gestures, referring to how Audria seems to be relying on The Brotherhood for many things, least of which is security.

I have one of those.\u201d\u201cThey take a long time to set up,\u201d she adds, before starting into a bit of bread as Konrad addresses others. He goes on to confirm what she suspected\u2014that he\u2019s doing this and banking on the Vessian armies getting bogged down in bureaucracy. In the time before they arrive, Konrad hopes to build an army of his own and solidify relations with these nations present at the feast. That way, when the Vessian armies do roll around, he will be strong, with allies.His plan is good, she thinks. As is the food.The conduct, however, is disgusting\u2014the others are right.

Her heart goes out to Queen Audrey.But in any case, the meaning behind her question seems to have gone over his head. After sampling the wine, Empress Naoki decides to approach from another angle.\u201cWhat sort of economic reliance did you have on Vessia?\u201d she asks Konrad. \u201cThese must be interesting times to be a merchant in Salem.

To be expected, even. However, it would make a lot of sense for you to join Isra. I don\u2019t know what you endured under Vessia, but Isra\u2019s rule is not so heavy-handed. States govern themselves as they please. The expectation is such that in return for contributing to the whole, all states benefit. All of Isra\u2019s states have joined voluntarily and have turned out better off for it.\u201d\u201cThe terms of the agreement are, of course, negotiable,\u201d she adds. \u201cTo be discussed at a later date, perhaps, in a more appropriate setting.\u201d", "1538260179000": "The Empress continues eating, and when asked, responds that the food is quite good, thank you.It seems like that really got to him.

Fortunately, his opinion of her doesn\u2019t much matter.\u201cVery well then,\u201d she says after a pause. \u201cI am willing to negotiate a standard trade agreement. Unless you have anything in mind beyond independent merchants buying and selling regular goods, I think we can leave the haggling to our appropriate subordinates.\u201dAt this point The Empress gives Iulia a significant look, implying that she, as a member of the Diplomatic Corps; should see that done.", "1538335733000": "The Empress watches the goings-on with a slightly bemused expression. She has several thoughts but articulates none of them, allowing Iulia to respond as she may choose.", "1539630766000": "The Empress accepts the paper and takes a moment to read it as Iulia speaks. Her eyes flick up from the paper to fix on Iulia, then Wilhelm, and finally Konrad before glancing back down to the paper. She pretends to read for a moment longer before making her decision.\u201cThat sounds like an excellent idea,\u201d she says, handing the paper back to Iulia.The Empress then addresses Wilhelm, \u201cTake this as your first lesson: politics aren\u2019t usually done in broom closets.\u201d She is none too pleased with the manner in which this development has been thrust upon her, but it suits her needs, so she will accept it for now. After offering best wishes and goodbyes to the others assembled, The Empress leads the way back to the carriages.[Exit]", "1493431615000": "In a relatively empty portion of the world, not particularly close to any large settlements or landmarks, there lies an unblemished expanse of beautiful purple flowers, spread across a series of several small hills. Nothing of note lies within the foothills beside the flowers themselves - no roads, structures, water features, or even trees.", "1508827687000": "[Enter from The Black Tower]The moon is nowhere to be found as Empress Naoki rides Haru  over the Amberhills, but its light is not missed. Instead, the gross luminescence of an enormous beam of light stretches infinitely skyward, casting light across the hills for miles around. The beam is a product of a ritual conducted at The Black Tower, and its location marks the position of the fourth Gem of Croeria, that which is said to have power over Air.In one hand Empress Naoki holds a golden scepter, long and straight. On its length can be found the other three Gems of Croeria, those related to Fire, Water, and Earth.Uncharacteristically, Lady Naoki is clad in a suit of armor, ears to toes. For the first time perhaps ever, none of her skin is exposed, not even so much as an ankle. Despite this, the armor does little to conceal her identity. Aside from the fact that the helmet has allowances for soft little ears and there\u2019s a scale-armored tail, the armor is every bit as shapely and elegant as its wearer, featuring the Isran crest prominently on the front and \u201cNaoki\u201d beautifully inscribed on each shoulder pad. Glowing yellow gemstones embedded throughout do well to lend favorable lighting and hint toward additional features.On this fateful evening, Naoki is feeling nothing if not apprehensive. This is the first time since moving to The Free City that she\u2019s gone beyond the borders of Isra into unclaimed, uncharted territory. There is some comfort to be found in that Grandma  is somewhere close, as well as in the absurdly powerful weapon she carries, but not enough to keep her from fidgeting.\u201cCircle around it,\u201d she whispers to Haru. Peering down past one leg, Naoki sees\u2026 Grass. Hills. A tree. That is to say, nothing. 'Nothing' is simultaneously precisely what she\u2019d like to see and entirely unsatisfying. It feels as if there should be something, but she doesn't want there to be because that would become an Issue.Shifting, she turns to look in the other direction, outward, into the darkness. Figuring it best to waste no time, she begins to reach out over the separating miles to those individuals who sit idle, awaiting her instructions.", "1509066614000": "As the Sentinels pop into being one by one, Empress Naoki is immediately aware of their arrival, spotting the shadows cast by their presence. Due to the shining pillar of light being the only source of light, everything casts a long shadow. This, she thinks, makes a high vantage such as hers all the more advantageous. In addition to making it easier to see the visible, the effect ought to do well to reveal the invisible she thinks, as well those things that would take the form of dark clouds or mist. Craning her neck, Lady Naoki is even able to make out the shape of Grandma, wispy and immaterial as though she is.Convenient, The Empress thinks. Occupied overseeing the arrival of her forces, she remains as of yet unaware of any guests. Were it not covered by her helmet, Lady Naoki\u2019s earring would glow marvelously in spite of the pillar as she continues issuing orders.First, she reaches out to Knight-Captain Calgary, speaking to him through the telepathic abilities bestowed by their accessories.\u201cExactly three things have my permission to be in the sky this evening, Commodore. Your company, the dark figure high above, and this very soft cat I am presently riding. All else - be it a bird, a bat, or a leaf floating lazily on the wind, is to be treated as an enemy and Destroyed.\u201dWhile it isn\u2019t clear if The Empress would truly have the Dawn Riders flying about swinging at leaves, he may get the impression that she was exceedingly conscious of her choice in words. She did not say \u2018grounded.'\u2019 Not \u2018killed,\u2019 or \u2018eliminated,\u2019 but Destroyed, with a capital D.\u201cEnsure that the air is clear,\u201d she commands.Though she doesn\u2019t show it, Lady Naoki remains tense during these first, uncertain stages of the plan. Not everything is in place, and that leaves room for attack. Raising one arm, she is pleased to see that the yellow gemstones embedded into her gauntlet are now shining brightly. Though this may make her quite visible, Lady Naoki finds comfort in this knowledge, and next begins to focus her attention on her staff as she continues issuing orders. \u201cCommander.\u201d The Empress addresses Torrin Delmirev from high above.\u201cThe ground on which you stand is now our position. Hold it, and consider all who approach as hostile. Remain alert; further instructions will follow.\u201dThen, with her officers taken care of, Naoki reaches to the mind of Lamina Manira. \u201cWelcome to the show,\u201d she says, with a touch of attempted humor in her commanding tone.A few moments pass. \u201c... I don\u2019t see you. Stay alert; the area is unsecured. Get to safety immediately, come to the light. If you make your location known, you could catch a ride.\u201dOne eye peeled for any Lamina-sized movement out in the dark, Empress Naoki continues to oversee the deployment of her forces from the safety of Haru as he flies around the beam of light.", "1510183598000": "Tentatively pleased with developments so far, Lady Naoki nods to herself. Given the apparent lack of resistance, she decides to accelerate her plans. Better to have this over with quickly than to draw it out. To this end, her next goal is to pick up Lamina. From there, all will be in order to proceed to the next part of her plan.Leaning forward, Naoki whispers in Haru  's ear, asking him to deviate from their course. Haru ought to be able to spot Lamina in the dark, she figures. By asking him to, that gives her time to shift slightly in her seat and channel a bit more power into the staff, preparing.", "1515982042000": "\u201cMove away from them.\u201d From her position upon Haru\u2019s back, The Empress channels the power of the staff.The ground trembles just slightly. A mere hiccup before it begins to truly shake, rumbling silently. After a moment of quaking, the earth rips, and a huge, squarish portion of soil and rock begins to inexplicably rise just ahead of Megan. It breaks somewhat cleanly, such so that if Megan continues on her current course for just a bit longer, she\u2019ll find a towering rock face directly before her, stretching tens of meters in every direction.Once she sees it\u2019s tall enough, Lady Naoki abruptly stops the spell. This causes significantly more quaking than absolutely necessary, which anyone on the ground would likely feel. Though, Naoki pumps her fist, pleased. She did what she intended to, and that\u2019s really all she was hoping for.", "1516442174000": "For the space of a few moments Lady Naoki wonders which she would choose, between getting tackled by a griffin and slamming into a rock wall. The wall isn\u2019t sharp, at least.However, the staff draws her attention. It\u2019s going somewhere as if it has a destination in mind. The only explanation that comes readily to mind is such that it's being drawn to the gem. Though, the gem must be underground. How will the staff proceed from that point? Naoki is unsure she\u2019d like to know, but if it will lead her to the gem, that would be terribly convenient.Lady Naoki murmurs to Haru, requesting that follow the staff at a safe distance. She\u2019ll leave Calgary to deal with the interloper. ", "1459042518000": "On the roads between The Black Tower - Gauldin Branch and Trav\u00e9re, the Isranian Embassy thunders along the wide and dusty roads of Gauldin. Madame Naoki leads the group from atop her gray steed, eyes and ears constantly in motion to survey the road ahead.They are fifty in number, including not only Madame Naoki, but also Artemis, thirteen other members of the Isranian Embassy, Royal Fletcher, Ravven Fletcher, Queen Arianne, Lady Genevieve St. James, Odette, as well as thirty armored and armed members of The Black Tower\u2019s finest cavalry, all riding in tight formation on horseback. Their plan is to proceed directly to Trav\u00e9re, stopping once at the halfway point to take a short snack break.", "1459226489000": "With their progress impeded no further, Madame Naoki\u2019s emabssy continues along the long roads to Trav\u00e9re. Halfway along their journey, they take their planned pit-stop, dismounting and finding shade under a collection of large trees off to one side of the road. Naoki had prepared, as part of their travel supplies, a crate containing a varied selection of sandwich making materials from The Midnight Sun. Over the course of a half hour, as the sun begins to take center stage in the sky, they eat. However, this pause doesn\u2019t take very long, and before long, they are back on the road with sated appetites, thundering along to complete their journey to Trav\u00e9re. [Exit to Trav\u00e9re with members of party.]"}
