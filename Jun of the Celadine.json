{"1462906471000": "It had been a long time since Jun had been home. After reuniting with her father, finding out that they were allies with a zombie nation and were heading off to fight another zombie nation, getting over the fact that there was a Black Tower in the Land-Tiller's Expanse, that Zaltos may or may not be floating over Goraia as a giant raging fireball of death, that the elves and Sodalites were now a public presence in the overworld and that they had been visited by a massive benevolent earth dragon who basically rewrote their history...(Good LORD she had missed a lot!)After she was done hyperventilating, she found out that one of the Land-Tiller's newest residents had been robbed, and that the perpetrator was possibly a high level combatant, Jun decided to go check it out.Already fully decked out in her combat equipment and carrying her pet crow Blackbean on her shoulder, Jun walked into the store to question the victim.*Knock knock* \"Hello? I'm here for the bounty mission?\"", "1464624201000": "<Enter from Izujin's expanse>\"Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr!\"There were sounds of struggle outside the door. A thin feminine voiced seemed to be straining with something.\"Grrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr! Blackbean, I, will, never... take... your strength... for granted!\"A few seconds later Jun would enter the shop, carrying a comically over-sized sack with her. It was full of the items that Izujin had stolen from Koren's shop.\"Hello! Koren!\" Jun said, out of breath. Koren would find her plopped next to the sack. \"We got your stuff back. Also, we didn't need the healing potions, or the silence potion,, or the underwater breathing potion, and we got these weird pendants. You can have them all.\" *pant* *pant* *pant* \"Oh! And we didn't kill him. But we didn't get his blade either. We just talked him into giving the stuff back to us. Apparently he needed some of the ingredients to cure his sick brother.\"*pant pant pant*", "1464674438000": "When Jun saw the bag shrink down, she promptly smacked herself in the face.\"Oh, umm, yah, he uh... huh.\" What did happen to that guy?Jun shrugged. Then she was presented with the etherobe... Her eyes widened at the incredible power of the artifact that she had just been given. But, she had a lot of questions.\"This is an incredible artifact that you just gave me. But, I have a lot of questions. Can you refill it with water? Can you change it from one weapon or piece of armor to another? What happens if you break it? What happens if it enters an anti-magic field? What happens if it breaks inside an anti-magic field? ...Do you sell more? If so how much?\"", "1464750753000": "Jun greedily listened to their entire conversation. Now what were the odds she happened to have 50 gold pieces on her?... Apparently quite bad.\"Remind me to come back here sometime.\" Jun carefully melded the etherobe to her simple buckler. It suddenly felt a lot less simple. She chuckled to herself. Even she admitted that her gear was getting ridiculous.\"It was good working with you.\" After struggling to get back up, she waved to both of them and took her new super weapon with her.<exit>", "1540337247000": "A silvery glint in the sky cast a crow-shaped shadow at the base of the cave. A few seconds later, the pair descended. His great wings flapped, and his talons hit the rocky floor with a little click.The horse-sized demon crow preened his feathers clear of snow, and Jun reached for a scroll in her side pouch while trying to catch a snowflake on her tongue. When she found what she was looking for, she swallowed what was left of the snowflake and trotted over to the side of the entrance, where she unraveled the paper scroll and stuck it to the rock like a poster. The scroll had a sigil drawn on it, characterized by concentric circles interspersed with runes. The black ink periodically throbbed into a softly luminescent cyan.Blackbean, the crow, stared down at the cave's void. Jun patted herself, making sure her cloth armor and dragon scale accessories were in place. She tapped her helmet, shoulders, hips, sword sheath, and each boot. Her eyes shifted while she tapped her groin through the thick enchanted cloth. Yep, all the armor was in place. She stepped back a few paces and detached a large sack that was tied to the demon crow's avian cataphract armor. Then she turned to face the cave again.\"Hello!?\" \"Si mi vi thurirl!\"The first phrase was, of course, just a greeting in common. The second phrase was in draconic, and translated it meant \"I am a friend.\" She wasn't necessarily expecting a response. She just wanted to make sure there were no dragons lurking before beginning her experiments.", "1540354611000": "Although the dragon glided down silently, its shadow alerted Blackbean to the dragon's presence just before it reached his friend.The next thing Clama would feel was a solid thump to its side as the guardian's chest armor crashed into it just before it reached Jun. The creature's iron black beak would immediately aim for its face, and its ferociously beating wings would attempt to disorient Clama\u00a0with curtains of feathers. The monstrosity would attempt to force the dragon into the stone wall outside the cave.In any case, Jun dropped her sack and swiveled around, her hand snapping Resonance from its sheath. As the sword's metal touched the air, it blared with a blinding silver which didn't harm the eyes, but could still obscure vision. The mountain air quickly became a golden desert breeze. A chorus of alien instrumental hums seemed to accompany the mage's wrath as she began gathering power. She held the sword over her head, giving her better sight and illuminating everything around her.\"Ritrekil!\" She cried in earnest.The draconic word \"cower\", contextually meaning \"take cover\", told the dragon to turtle so she could safely call off Blackbean. She chose this word instead of \"surrender\", as dragons were more likely to follow direct instructions than concede their pride to a human.", "1540399963000": "Blackbean's helmet hissed and frothed as the acid ate it away. What were cries of anger became cries of panic as it struggled to dislodge itself from the dragon's teeth.\"NO!\"Though the shriek came from Jun, Clama's eyes would miss her as the glowing mage suddenly disappeared from her current position. She'd reappear right next to Clama, right in front of the teleportation beacon that Jun had placed on the rock wall earlier. The safety measure's sigil burned hot red, though not as hot as Jun's presence as her body quickly encased itself in what looked like a crystalline substance, as she charged forward.Before the acid could make it to Blackbean's feathers, two light tendrils would spring into the crevice between Blackbean's head and the hinge of Clama's jaws. These structures were malleable yet solid, translucent, like water filled with sunlight. They would force Clama's jaws open with the unbridled strength of a frightened parent to release Blackbean.Jun's physical body was encased in a globular mass of the strange substance, from which these tendrils sprung.\"Aurthon!\" Enough! Her voice shook the cave walls as she would attempt to slam Clama's head against the wall.Nobody fucks with Blackbean.", "1540401589000": "Though perhaps her flesh was thick enough to not feel it, she would notice that Jun's encased form was scalding hot.With Blackbean free, Jun's temper ebbed. She was now more curious about the dragon's sudden change in demeanor. It took her a second to process that the dragon wasn't apologizing and giving her a hug, but actually trying to grab her. Huh, well that wasn't very bright. Jun was still safe inside her construct, which she could sustain for a while as long as she kept feeding it magic. Her tendrils, less inclined to try to piledrive the dragon than before, gently came down to lift Clama's wrists from her glowing case, bouncing them up and down in a mock handshake.\"Oh... you speak common. That's convenient.\" Her voice was coherent, but came off as watery and synthesized through the veil of her light construct protection, which itself hummed softly with magic.Blackbean shook off the remains of his destroyed helmet and cawed angrily at the dragon. That helmet was both a shiny and a gift, both things exceedingly valuable to a crow of any size. The goopy, rusted mess continued to hiss in agony on the rocky floor.", "1540406151000": "One of the tendrils lifted into the air. Its tip crooked like a finger.\"... You know what? Fair enough.\"The light construct floated back and landed next to Blackbean. The pair was now on the edge of the mountain platform where the cave entrance was located, away from the entrance. This put Clama in between her home and her supposed transgressors.\"So, since we started off on the wrong foot,\" Jun said as she placed her tendrils onto the helmet's ruins. \"My name is Jun. My friend's name is Blackbean. And we weren't looking for you. We were just seeking out empty cave formations so we could conduct some experiments. Sadly it looks like this one doesn't qualify.\" As she explained, something invisible seemed to pump in from the tendrils onto the helmet. The helmet's metaphorical clock began to rewind, and the helmet started to reform to its original, shinier state. As this happened, Jun's defensive construct shrank and ebbed away. By the time the helmet was fully repaired, Jun's body was exposed, and the tendrils were reduced to thin spaghetti strands which then flickered out of existence.Jun picked up the oversized helmet and fit it on Blackbean's head. \"So that brings me to my next question. Why do you need a human?\" She spoke in a calm, matter-of-fact tone. It was clear she had lowered her defenses as a sign of parley, and she had repaired the helmet so that the magic wouldn't go to waste.Blackbean gratefully accepted his helmet. But then he leered at the dragon mistrustfully, indignant and not as quick to forgive as Jun.", "1540408263000": "Jun blinked.\"Ok.\" She said spryly. She shrugged at Blackbean and went to retrieve the sack that he had carried with her. She grabbed a couple of scrolls from her side pouch and held them along with the contents of her bag. Then she started ruffling through the contents of the bag. Her back was turned to Clama as she gazed off at the mountain range. She stood somewhat precariously close to the edge.\"Luckily it's a nice view, and my experiments were gonna take a while anywa- woops.\"Two scrolls fell from her bag and slipped down the mountainside, beyond her view. \"Ah, well, those were blank anyways.\" She continued ruffling until she found what she was looking for.Blackbean kept giving Clama the stink eye the whole time.As Clama\u00a0got close enough, Jun pulled out her prize. \"Ah hah! Here, smell!\" She shoved the strange object in her nostrils.It was a black, leathery, wrinkly bundle of something or other. It smelled of cinnamon and menthol.\"I know it looks like an old burnt book, but it's actually an edible lichen that grows in parts of the Saskatoon mountains. We call it manna lichen... for some reason. It doesn't have any mana in it, but it has medicinal properties and tastes good with pine nuts.\" She walked past Clama and towards the cave, gesturing to it. \"The idea is to farm these at very high altitudes with the help of magic, and maybe even without it. That would make it easier for humans and other creatures to live in otherwise inhospitable environments.\"", "1540410935000": "In the few minutes that the dragon had been gone, Jun had been busy.Already, there were four mounds of snow sitting in a row outside the cave entrance. One had gravel scattered on top and a sample of the lichen sitting on top of that. The second was just a pile of snow, with no gravel. The other two appeared to match the first pair. The difference was something only someone magically inclined would detect. All four of them had a slight magical signature buried within the snow, but two of the signatures were a bit stronger than the others.Jun was pulling out two more lichens from her sack when Clama returned.I didn't think there were deer for miles around here. She's a fast flier. Interesting.Then she saw the scrolls. \"Oh.\"She grinned politely. \"Aww, you didn't have to do that. Thank you.\"Clama would notice that the giant crow was nowhere to be found. Instead, there was an indignant,\u00a0normal-sized crow sitting on Jun's shoulders, dressed in a miniature version of the cataphract armor the giant was wearing.", "1540412150000": "Jun shrugged. \"It's a long story.\"She took the scrolls and placed them back into her pouch. Then she held up her lichens and peered into the cave.\"Mind if I set some of these up inside the cave?\"", "1540427190000": "From her pouch, Jun pulled out a magnifying glass and began examining the cave floor. Her opposite hand raised a finger, and a candlelight-style fire ignited from the tip so she could see better.\"Mmmph, I guess I'll start by saying that I know being a dragon isn't easy. It's competitive and harsh, and their challenges often scale with their immense power.\"She bent down and really examined the mineral content of the cave floor. She scanned her way over towards the stream where the carcass was being dressed. As she walked, she continued. \"If there's one thing I know for certain about dragons, it's that there's one thing a dragon always keeps, and must always protect: its pride.\"She raised her head up to look at Clama, her giant-sized eyeball blinking within the face of the magnifying glass. \"And that goes for the good and the bad ones. Even the holy dragon I met has her pride, though she does a better job of hiding it than most.\"She lowered her magnifying glass, causing her eyeball to return to normal size. She smirked playfully at Clama and then pointed at the carcass. \"Nice job.\"", "1540434718000": "Jun sits down in front of the grilled meat. \"Haven't had venison in a while.\" She sniffed it. \"Oh, uh, well scholars are still debating if their language has possessive contractions or not. I'm kinda rusty so I don't have an opinion.\"She took a little bite of the meat. \"Mmm! Mmm. Mmm... Oh. There are many different kinds: blue, red, copper, silver... There are special ones that serve important roles, like guarding the earth or even the power of magic itself. The one I met was a former red, who underwent a special transformation. She decided she wanted to pursue justice and holiness, and somehow she awakened an incredible power. She taught me some of that power, which is how I learned to use holy magic.\"She took another large bite. \"I didn't know dragon flame was so good for cooking though. That's neat.\"Blackbean hopped over to the scraps and started picking at them. Occasionally he looked up at Clama, still stern. But his disposition to her seemed marginally improved.", "1540440459000": "\"I mean, I'd be pretty surprised if you weren't a dragon. Not all dragons are raised by their parents. Silver dragons keep their young close until they're adults, but red dragons leave them to fend for themselves. The Earthwarden, a very powerful nature dragon, was able to adopt a baby red though. So I guess rules are made to be broken.\"Jun patted her face when he brought up the scars. She craned her neck and touched the space under her jaw. Then she looked at her hands.Most of her body was covered in armor, but even then a couple of scars were visible. They weren't abhorrent to look at, in her opinion. But they were definitely there...She sighed. \"That's... complicated.\" Her tone was whiny and hesitant. \"Ayyyy... I keep them around as a reminder of what I used to be. Some of them have some good stories behind them. I got this one from when I used my cousin as bait to catch a bear. Poured honey on her head and everything.\" She pointed to one on her hand. \"I think I got this from slaughtering a bunch of rock ogres in an abandoned fortress. I don't feel bad. They ate children, soo...\" She pointed to one under her chin.\"I guess I have a complicated relationship with my old self.\" She bit into another piece of venison.", "1540484744000": "Jun had pulled out a pouch of dried figs to eat along with her venison, when she noticed the dragon inching closer to her.She leaned back in tandem, wide-eyed and frank-faced. \"This isn't the part where we start making out is it?\"Blackbean also looked up at the dragon, with a rather large piece of sinew hanging from his beak.", "1540486292000": "Jun smirked. \"You're not a very old dragon, are you?\"She popped a fig into her mouth as her torso leaned back into normal upright position. \"Do you know how to transform into a human?\"Blackbean went back to his bit of sinew. He seemed to have trouble picking it apart.", "1540488748000": "Jun chuckled and took another bite of her food. \"Yes, well, age is just a number. Many people in my tribe believe in reincarnation, so it's plausible my soul is even older than yours. After all, it takes a certain amount of wisdom to know that power isn't everything, and that you don't always have to pick dragon each life.\"She paused and looked up at the cave ceiling in thought. \"Though I guess since I'm a powerful mage I'm not exactly one to talk...\"She shrugged. \"Anyways, nearly every dragon I've met has the power to transform into a human. The former Earthwarden becomes this regal sort of lady with long flowing green hair. The holy dragon, the former red, becomes a fair-skinned\u00a0princess sort with golden hair. Jarkoopi the Storm... conjurer... something, I forget, he takes on a handsome warrior visage. And this one hybrid I met, copper and blue I think, he likes the form of an old hermit. Oh, and then there is this gigantic red who lives in a volcanic chasm. He's...\"Jun's eyes froze as her flashback began.One Mississippi, Two Mississipi, Three Mississipi-\u00a0\"... Echem. Let's just say he's attractive.\"She shook her head and finally decided it was safe to take off her helmet and coif. She started dealing with the straps as she spoke. \"Anyways, since most dragons can transform into humans, it would stand to reason that if you're a dragon, you can also transform into a human. You also probably have an aptitude for magic somewhere in there.\"When her coif came off, it was revealed that Jun had straight, jaw-length, dark brown hair. Her olive skin and demi-oriental face were clearer as well. As far as humans went, she looked about mid-20s.Blackbean had resorted to violently shaking his head back and forth like an angry dog as he tried to get the long piece of sinew into two pieces while making meaty, feathery flapping noises.", "1540493801000": "Blackbean leaped back in fright. But upon seeing his prize conveniently sliced in half, he takes one of the pieces and swallows it whole.\"I'm not pressuring you. It's just that you said you're not sure if you're a dragon. Dragons have a knack for transforming into humans. So if you can learn how to do it, it makes it that much more likely that you are, in fact, a dragon.\"When the maybe-dragon spoke her piece on power, Jun seemed to have another flashback.\"Yah...\" She said distantly. \"Power does mean you can do what you want. It's a privilege. There are many things I don't have to deal with that a lot of humans, females especially, do.\" Her countenance seem to brighten a bit, and she looked at Clama in the eyes with a grin. \"I guess in a funny way I'm sort of a gentle giant. When you're powerful, you have this privilege to be friendly to anything you want. It's a gift that not a lot of beings with power take advantage of, unfortunately.\"", "1540517653000": "\"Well, how could that be? I'm the one who's being held captive.\" Jun grinned devilishly.She watched as the dragon struggled to turn itself into a human, for about five minutes. Once she had her fill of venison, she decided to continue with her experiments.After 25 minutes or so, an isolated section of the cave floor was littered with little mounds of earth, each housing a little lichen on top. Some of them also had some cave mushrooms sprouting up next to the lichens. Each one had a scroll slapped onto the side of the mound, similar to the teleportation beacon she had used earlier, but with different shaped sigils scribbled onto them. Floating over each mound was some combination of a glowing, sun-like sphere the size of a softball, a fuzzy miniature rain cloud, one alternating for the other, or nothing at all. The intent was clearly to determine the ideal conditions in which these lichens could grow.Jun looked over her work with pride. Her elemental magic was becoming increasingly sophisticated with each passing year. When she first started her adventure, she could never have done something like this. She was too focused on blowing stuff up. Now it was starting to look like she would one day surpass her father's farming abilities.And she could still blow things up.What she was not particularly good at was the weirder, wackier side of magic. Working with the world's natural elements was relatively simple. It was all about making friends with the elements, resonating with them. Making them bend over backwards to transform a dragon into a person, or even an object into another object, was something else entirely. At this point, it was literally easier for Jun to summon a thundercloud than convincingly pull a rabbit out of a hat.So when the cloud of smoke came and Clama managed to actually do something, she swiveled around and watched with interest. Had she really done it? Had she transformed into a human, through pure concentration alone?!If she had, Clama's instinct for magic was actually quite good, even if it did take half an hour.", "1540519859000": "\"Welp, that settles it. You're a dragon... I mean, probably. Most likely.\" She nodded reassuringly.She looked at her double up and down. \"Gosh.\" She took steps to circle her, examining all the little details of her armor, examining her own scars.\"Wow. Heh.\" She put her hands on her hips and smiled. \"You know, I'm not bad looking. So what other magic do you know?\"Blackbean had been \"sunning\" himself underneath of Jun's experiments. He flew over to them and sat on the real Jun's shoulder, almost as if to prove a point. Jun gentled rubbed his head.", "1540522299000": "Jun quirks an eyebrow as the poor dragon struggled. \"Maybe you need to focus for half an hour to change back? We should probably work on your speed and efficiency. Hmm... Yah, that could work.\"The gears were churning inside Jun's head. Jun could never, ever pass up a chance to gain a new power (as long as the process didn't require anything nefarious of course).\"I will make you a deal Miss Dragon-Who-Forgot-to-Introduce-Her-Name-to-Me-By-the-Way. I'm actually not very good at transformations like this. I can't do them at all. But, I can do other things. If you can help me learn how to transform like this, I'll teach you how to do something a little more raw.\" She demonstrated by taking a step back and holding up her fingertips. They suddenly ignited; golden flames danced and leaped from her fingers. She swung her hand around, and the flames stretched out like golden ribbons. With a few waggling fingers, the flames encircled the faux Jun. But before they could burn her or set her on fire, they disappeared.Jun then snapped her fingers and pointed at Clama. \"As an added bonus, I think I can at least change you back.\"", "1540522489000": "Jun lowered her hand and bowed politely. \"It's nice to meet you. So what do you think of my offer?\"Blackbean's gaze remained on Clama, despite the change in elevation as Jun bowed. His little head tilted up, then down again to compensate.", "1540611848000": "Jun nodded her head calmly and reached into another side pouch. She pulled out a small, unremarkable looking seed.\"Now this won't hurt, I promise. Although it might feel kinda funny.\" She extended her hand out and would attempt to put the seed on Fake Jun's forehead.If she was successful, the seed would instantly split and begin to sprout a thin, mucousy vine. The vine had many small appendages on it, each tipped with a sticky bit of dew. It was like a Sundew plant, only it grew exponentially faster. The vine would branch into many little vines and spread out all over Clama's body. As this happened, Jun would hold out a hand towards Clama, her fingers twitching slightly. An aura of wavy air shimmered around her; it seemed like she was carefully regulating the growth of the mystery plant.If Clama allowed all of this to happen, she'd feel her facade start to give way to her draconic size. Her leathery tough flesh would overcome the human skin. Her thin, barely functional nails would start to form into proud claws. And finally, her devoid back would give way to her wings. She would grow bigger and bigger until she was once again, a dragon.Once she was done, the plant would stop growing, though it would remain on her forehead, where the seed pod would sprout a big purple flower.One more thing: Clama would sense that her magical powers were completely drained and that all her power seemed to be contained inside the flower.\"How do you feel?\"", "1540614366000": "Jun chuckled. \"Relax. All you gotta do is eat the plant. But that said, you might wanna just gently remove it. Your body needs to be low on mana for your first lesson to begin. If you don't eat the plant, your mana will still come back over time.\"", "1540681748000": "Jun is swept up in the dragon's overzealous arms. She did tense up for a second, afraid she would have to defend herself due to the dragon's mistrust. But instead, the dragon extended its gratitude for not squishing her.Jun smiled and stretched out her arms to... just barely reach out and pat the dragon's shoulders.\"Aww... I know I'm perfect.\" She chuckled. Her armor prevented her from being turned into jelly by the dragon's embrace-\"... You can let go now I can feel my spine pressing against my spleen.\"-mostly anyway.Once she was free, she took a step back and rummaged through her things once again, in search of something pertinent. As she did so, she asked, \"So in the hundred or so years you've been alive, have you ever stopped and wondered what makes you, you?\"---Meanwhile, it had indeed not been lost on the bird that he could have attacked the dragon in that moment. But after working with Jun for many years, he had learned to accept that Jun was stubborn and always tried to make things go her way, whether it was in pursuit of power or, more recently, in pursuit of a more genuine form of benevolence. Her goals had changed and her character had improved (depending on your point of view), but her core had remained the same. Jun was not one to be dissuaded from her goal. If she was going to be merciful to the overgrown iguana, he would have no choice but to go along with her machinations.Sometimes Blackbean missed the younger Jun, who probably would have tried to kill Clama on the spot. Ironically the current Jun was far more powerful, and yet disinclined to do so. Oh well.He was still her best friend. And these adventures still provided a better lifestyle than hell ever could.", "1540936972000": "*Caw!*\"He says you're welcome, probably. He might actually be saying you owe him.\"Blackbean did nothing to clarify the confusion and just started preening himself.Jun pulled out yet another scroll. She unraveled it. This one, like the others, had a sigil drawn into it, characterized by concentric shapes around a focal point. The ink pulsed with a gentle cyan which bathed the beige parchment it was drawn on. Clama would sense a substantial amount of power radiating from it.\"So, Clama, tell me. If fire had a personality, what do you think it would be? And then, more importantly, do you think you could be friends with it?\"", "1540943218000": "Jun blinks, noting that the creature seemed to deliberately dodge part of her question.\"Do you... know what friendship is?\" She quirked an eyebrow curiously.The parchment's soft glow remained steady as Jun brought it to her side, as if she was going to use it, but realized she would have to wait a bit.", "1540944487000": "Jun sighed. This is gonna be tougher than I thought.\"Ok. Let's try this. Imagine what your perfect friend would be like. Think about what their personality would be like, what kinds of interests they have... Oh! Maybe, what kind of dragon hoard they would have.\"She started snapping her fingers and grinning excitedly as something came to mind.\"What kind of dragon hoard do you have? Different kinds of dragons like to collect different things. That says a lot about who and what they are. Some dragons love magical artifacts. Some like gold. Some like art work. And some like historical artifacts, like old scrolls and statues and stuff. I've heard rumors of dragons that count entire ancient temples as their hoards.\"Yah, that's it. If I can figure out what kind of hoard this dragon keeps, maybe I can figure out what element to teach it.\"So yah, what would your perfect friend be like, and tell me what kind of hoard you have. It's important for you to have a better idea of what kind of person... er, dragon person, you are, if you want to learn my brand of magic.\"", "1540954913000": "Jun cocked her head curiously at the single gem, one of the smallest hoards she had ever seen on a dragon. The gears continued to rotate in her head. She analyzed every bit of information she had received.With her strength, surely she could have obtained a much larger hoard if she was so inclined.She seems to want a pet, a friend, something to nurture and protect.She doesn't care about the size of her friend's hoard.She can heal.She thanked Blackbean for not attacking her.She retrieved the scrolls.She wants power so she can feel safe.Jun blinked.There is no... there's no way. You have got to be kidding me.Her eyes shifted up to Clama. The incredulity of her hypothesis was well-hidden.\"You know, one way you could increase the size of your hoard is by helping others. Sometimes villagers need help dealing with a local monster, or flooding waters, or something like that. Sometimes a city needs criminals to be tracked down. Sometimes a powerful necromancer needs taking down. And if you're lucking you can get treasures in exchange. Basically, you could be a hero for hire. Does that sound like something that interests you?\"Jun smirked hopefully.", "1540957900000": "Jun chuckled. \"Oh gee, it's too bad you can't do something about that like, you know, disguise yourself as a human or something.\"She tossed the scroll up into the air.WOOOSH!The air split apart. Jun violently thrust her hands out to her sides. The scroll flared up over Jun's head and stood firm against some invisible wall. Sparkles. Sparkles erupted from the scroll and flooded the entire cave. Hundreds of lights dancing around, all golden and defiant, hundreds of tiny suns filled the cave with warmth and light, as if the stars of the night sky had been invited to grace the lonely mountain cave with their gallantry.Jun gradually lowered her hands to her sides. Her eyes were now filled with a steely determination. Despite seemingly doing nothing, the little stars continued to dance around. If Clama could focus, she'd realize Jun was the epicenter of their myriad of orbits. Jun was the eye of a glittering storm.\"This is the element you're going to master. Light.\" She said calmly.She raised a hand into the air, as if to reach out and touch the cave ceiling.The golden lights stopped.Then they started again, but this time they were drawn to an invisible spot upon which Jun transfixed her gaze. They rushed into the spot and coalesced into a long golden mass. It would be hard to decipher at first, but as the glare winded down and the light stabilized, Clama would see it was a construct of light. It looked like glowing quartz that had been carved into something.It was a large sword.", "1541310805000": "Jun noticed that her light show had made quite an impression on the dragon. Unfortunately, it wasn't quite the impression she was going for.\"Oh, well, I mean, it's a pretty standard light construct. But you can make all kinds of things with light.\"She quickly rummaged through her head for something a little less offensive. Perhaps Clama had a bad run-in with a sword user. Quick, think think think.The light coalesced to a single blob. It was no longer a sword. The glittering, nebulous nothing then bubbled out on the tops and bottoms, forming appendages. These refined themselves into little claws, a tail, and horns. Jun visibly strained as she struggled to concentrate. This shape was exceeding complex, even for her. Technically no human had ever managed to command more than five light constructs at once. Here she was bending the rules by instead making a single very complex construct. It took a few seconds, but with the mental dexterity of a clown forming a balloon giraffe, she finished.It was a cute, adorable, baby dragon, about as opposite from a sword as you can get.", "1541311412000": "Jun lowered her head a bit. Her eyes shut and her brow furrowed down sadly. She could sense Clama's loneliness.\"Yes and no. A light construct is commanded by a small portion of my mind. It has a bit of me in it. But if I lose my concentration, it stops existing. The closest I can do to bringing it to life is let myself into it more, if that makes sense.\"The dragon floated down to the ground, and carefully trotted over to Clama's feet, where it would give her leg a warm little hug with its short arms. Its tail would wag slightly like a dog's.Jun smirked sympathetically as she looked up at Clama.", "1541312722000": "\"Magic is a very strange thing. At least, the school of magic I was taught says so. The elements are alive. They have their own soul to them. They have a nature, a spirit. And in order to wield that magic most effectively, you have to allow yourself to resonate with that magic. It's like a form of communication, a dance.\"The little light dragon scurries up Clama's arm and sits atop her head.\"So, in a way that creature is me, but it also represents the uh, the spirit of light energy itself, reaching out to you, wanting to help you. Theoretically, you can learn to reach out as well, and use a part of yourself to communicate with the elements. Your will becomes one.\"The dragon tugged on Clama's skull... thing.\"Light energy is very... extroverted. It loves to reach out and find places where it is missing. It is represented in the bonds between others. It brings people together. Often it forgets about itself. It is very selfless. It is also very active, seeking to shape the world in whatever way it can. It is a very creative force. It's the opposite of dark energy, which is very focused on the self and internal world. Darkness is more about introspection and personal desire. Both of these forces, ideally, are balanced. If I were to make a dark dragon, its main concern would be protecting me at all costs. A light dragon instead wants to be your friend. You can see how they're different but equally important in their own way.\"", "1541476836000": "\"Well, yah, possibly. Light energy can do all kinds of things. I figured it was up your alley since you said you can already heal scars... Unless I'm missing something.\"Jun furrowed her brow. An odd thought occurred to her. \"Wait a second, how do YOU heal scars?\"The light dragon, as if just as curious as Jun, would lower its head in front of Clama's field of vision and cock it slightly like a confused, upside down puppy.", "1541477520000": "The little dragon gave a thumbs up, though upside down it looked like a thumbs down. But the intent was obvious.\"Sounds about right. But did you know it can also be used to repair things? Like Blackbean's helmet. Also, light doesn't care about what you look like. It cares about what you do, and what's in your heart. After a while, you don't really need to force the light to heal things. You can just... ask it to.\"", "1541479583000": "\"... I'm sorry to hear that.\"Jun was starting to tire, so the light dragon hopped off of Clama's head and trotted over to Jun, who walked to a nearby rock to sit down on it. She stared at the floor, pensively.\"I have a friend, who was forced to kill many people against his will. It took many years for him to recover from that, to try to live as a happy, normal person. But it can be done.\" She looked up at Clama, and smiled warmly with optimism. \"You were acting in self-defense, and you didn't know your own strength. I know it's hard, killing someone, especially when you didn't mean to. But with time, you can learn to forgive yourself, as well as the human.\"The little dragon stood on its hind legs and folded its arms. Then it nodded in affirmation, like a genie. As it came back down, it saluted Clama. And then, its form suddenly broke apart.\"Sorry, I can't hold a shape that complex forever. It'll be back eventally.\"Its remains, hundreds of little star lights, once again spread out throughout the cave, illuminating every corner of it with light energy.", "1541480638000": "Jun allows herself to be lifted onto Clama. She decides a dragon is a good place to lie down and rest her eyes. She does so, resting her cheek on her folded arms. Blackbean flutters up and sits down on her head. He wiggles himself into her hair and nests there. The three of them made a funny little pyramid.\"Mmm, well, you can start by trying to get these lights to move.\" She said. Then she yawned.Indeed, all the lights had stopped moving and were now curiously still.", "1541651332000": "They were warm and fuzzy, like hugs in glowing vapor form. But they barely moved.Jun yawned. She raised her head slightly and observed the lights from underneath her messy, sleepy bangs.\"Try thinking of them as lost children. Or imagine the baby dragon living in them. How would you get them to move?\"", "1543298718000": "The shining lights slowly drifted towards the warmth of the dragon flame. They stopped short a few feet and idled around the warmth.Jun raised her head slightly to get a look at the lights. \"Alright, not bad. That feeling you got when you tried to warm them up, that little spark of compassion. Focus on that, and then try to get them even closer. Because that feeling? That's the stuff they're made out of. So you have to show them you understand what they are.\"Her head lowered back down to rest in her arms.", "1545105844000": "The lights all gather around the flame, able to read Clama's intentions somehow. They hover, gently bobbing up and down, drawn to the flame like moths, though the fire did not seem to harm them.As Clama raised her wings to shield Jun from the light, the lights responded to Clama's compassion and lowered themselves down towards the cave floor. This caused the shadows of Clama's wings to elongate and darken the cave even more. Down they went, forming a puddle of twinkling starlight for Clama's feet to wade in.\"Good, good. Now you're getting... it.\" Jun seemed to really want to go to sleep. It had been a long day. Blackbean was also snoring.\"The magic gets you. It understands. All the elements are... *yawn* like that. They all have their personalities. Fire, water, earth, wind, darkness, light, lightning, psionics, all of them have a personality you can resonate with, an emotion you can use to communicate with them. And they all have their unique powers. That's how you can heal. Light heals, and it makes constructs. It can also repair... objects. I feel... like... I'm... repeating myself... sorry...\"As Jun started to lose consciousness, the lights started winking out one by one.", "1545499899000": "A stone falls up, and also falls down. A stone falls up, and also falls down. But how can this be?These strange words would float into Clama's mind. They were gentle and soft words, words of mentorship and care.A stone falls up, and also falls down. A stone falls up, and also falls down. But how can this be?About half of the lights wink out of existence, coinciding with Jun softly snoring. A second set of softer, higher-pitched snores can be heard in the background. This is most likely Blackbean.But the other lights remain, dancing around the fire. Some of them float up a bit, and others float down. Then they trade off, with the ones above descending, and the ones below ascending. Up and down they go, gently around the fire.How can a stone go up, and also go down?", "1547184491000": "The answer, is that there are two stones.The lights continued to bob up and down in sync. Half went up, and the other half went down. They formed a glittering wave whose shape was only given by the lights.You can command both a sword and a shield, or two swords or two shields. But you must begin with two stones. One falls up, and the other falls down.As Clama\u00a0thought about the human she tried to befriend, some of them drifted out of formation. They took to the fore and organized themselves into the vague shape of a human. It had two arms and two legs, and a head. But that was about it.Your thoughts are your choice. Our form is your choice.", "1456123119000": "At some point, Raynor would receive the following letter via messenger crow:Dear Dad.I'm sorry we haven't talked in a while. I know I left suddenly. And I know you didn't really want me to go. But the truth is, I'm doing alright. In retrospect I think you were right all along, about the person I was meant to be, the person that I really was deep down inside, but at the same time it was just one of those things I had to figure out for myself, y'know?I'm so... so.. sorry I didn't listen to you, about what kind of person I was meant to be. You always saw the overwhelming good in me. I think in a way what you saw was yourself in me. And, I guess it must have hurt when I suppressed those parts of me in favor of... well, less savory parts. The truth is I was insecure. I felt weak. And I felt like I needed to get in touch with my darker half in order to be stronger, so I could experience what she felt. Actually, I did get the insight I wanted in the end, but I ultimately decided to follow my own path.Sometimes I felt like I understood her better than you, but for heaven's sake, she was your mother! I should have known you were wise enough to give me good advice about the person I should become. You'll be happy to know I met a powerful holy dragon, yes that's right, a holy dragon, named\u00a0Lum'Valia  . She's been tutoring me in becoming a holy mage. And if I do say so myself, I'm getting really good at it. I had to give up my demon magic and blood magic to start learning the virtues. I've got two already! Did grandma ever learn any?! Or did being a chaos mage make it impossible for her?Mom would be disappointed to find out that I never, ever took up archery. So I won't be shooting rocks out of the sky. And even though our tribe believes in opportunities for both men and women, I just could never see myself with a war hammer. My tomboyism has its limits. Maybe it's just because I don't wanna be TOTALLY like you, even though I am. I just see the warhammer as a father's weapon I guess. It's silly I know. By the way, tell mom I love her and I miss her, since she'll probably be off hunting when you get this.Actually, MOM, yah I know you're reading this now. At least I hope you are. I've heard rumors there are Acacia archers protecting Isra's borders, so you might be with them. Anyways, I DID find myself some cool melee weapons, and I'm gonna try to get in shape so I can use them properly. So there! I'm not a total book worm. Happy?!I love you mom.That reminds me, I've heard recently that the Phoenix State formerly turned our land into a Protectorate. I've met [Phoenix] Zaltos Kiraxo   personally and I even trained with him for a bit. He's very powerful, and a good man overall, but he can be kind of a jerk sometimes. From what I understand, he's treating our people well. But I don't know much about them beyond what he's told me. If the Land-Tiller's Expanse ever comes under attack, I promise I'll make it there as fast as possible. I know you guys are tougher than people give you credit for. Most over world people either haven't heard of us or think we're weak farmers. They'll be in for a surprise for sure.OH! My friend\u00a0Doobie du Shoobie   says hi. He's a magic-wielding kobold. He's pretty awesome. I'm a little worried he's gonna try to take over the world someday, but I can think of worse overlords.I've been through so much in the last couple of years. It'd take a whole journal to tell you everything. But just know, I'm ok. I'm much more powerful now then I was when I first left.Anyways, that's all for now. Take care of yourself.-JunPS: Tell Ma'Sum, I... I don't blame him if he finds someone else to be happy with. You might as well know, he threatened to break up with me if I left... He deserves to be happy. He shouldn't wait for me. I'm... erm... meeting other people too. But if I could have the privilege of retaining his friendship, I'd appreciate it. That's his call though. I don't blame him either way.", "1470292743000": "Jun appeared once again in a bright flash of blue light. She was holding a ceramic bowl of water. She seemed to be in a good mood as she held out the bowl to the enervated man. \"Here. It's got some tea leaves and roots in it so it might taste a little gingery, but I think you'll like it.\"The rest of the Land-Tillers concluded their meeting and started to go back to their farms. Meanwhile Raynor approached the stranger. Jun suddenly shook her head. \"Oh, sorry, I should introduce myself. My name is Jun, and this is my dad, Raynor. He's one of the elders here.\" Her father gave a little bow towards Enigma as his daughter took responsibility for the niceties.As Jun and Raynor took care of Enigma, the other Land-Tillers would shrug and lose interest, minus a few children who could continue to stare in awe.\"Oh.\" As the sun started to set, Jun would notice a carriage approaching. She recognize the ornamentation as Isranian. Could it be?\"Is that, Madame Naoki approaching?\" Somewhat cautiously she stepped forwards and started to wave at the approaching carriage. It was still a distance away, but hopefully it would spot her.", "1470436000000": "Jun strained somewhat between the telephathic communication from Naoki and Enigma's cryptic words. She decided to focus on Naoki.\"Sorry, hold on.\" She raised a finger towards Enigma and winced slightly. She hadn't used her stone in a while. Madame Naoki! It is you! Umm... Hang on.\u00a0Jun suddenly turned to her father and stared at him for a few awkward seconds. Then her face broke into a slight chuckle. \"Oh, right, sorry, I was trying to talk to you with the mind, thing, nevermind. Uh, It's Madame Naoki's carriage. She's on her way.\" His father nodded genially as Jun returned to Naoki's consciousness. There's a collective stable just a little ways up the road. You'll see it next to one of the towers. Your driver should take the carriage there. They won't turn anyone away, especially if you're a foreign dignitary. The rest of you can get off now if you want and make your way over here. I'm not sure what your plans are but we do have guest quarters. Also since my father leads this village it's easily the safest one in the expanse. No need to worry about security. Also there's no shortage of food here if you like vegetables.With all that done Jun turned back to Enigma. \"Sorry about that. Uh, I mean I used to hang out in Stonevale all the time before, well you know.\" Her face lost some enthusiasm. She was still heartbroken over the fate of Medan. \"Are you like a refugee from there or something? If you are you're welcome to stay here. I'll take care of you myself.\" She smiled. There was a slight twinkle in her eye. \"Er, not that you're not welcome to stay here if you aren't. I was just, uh, hehe, just bringing up the possibility is all.\"Raynor was stoic, and polite, not wanting to be too bothersome around Jun's friends. That said, he did feel something odd about Enigma. Jun might have interpreted his demeanor differently, but Raynor saw it for what it was, guilt. Still, he said nothing at the moment.", "1470887229000": "Jun chuckled awkwardly and scratched the back of her head. Her expression was almost painful. Had she gone a little too far in offering Enigma hospitality? \"Uh, well, whatever your story, you're welcome to stay as long as you need to. Forgive me, but I've got to attend to these people.\"As \"these people\" approached, Jun strolled over to meet them halfway.Raynor thought for a moment, and decided to follow, but not before giving the strange young man a good grip on the shoulder. Whether he took this as a comforting gesture or not was up to him. His expression was still rather stoic.As soon as she was within range, there was another bright flash of light. Jun disappeared and reappeared just a few meters in front of the pair, her cape billowing back despite the lack of wind. She was about a fraction of a second away from glomping the cat girl, but she stopped herself, realizing it was best not to incite the panic of the Sun Marshalls guarding her. She did open up her arms for a nice, normal, pleasant hug.Assuming Lady Naoki reciprocated, Jun would turn to Kate Green. \"Is this your dear companion?\" She said with a wink.(It was at this moment that she detected a very slight scent of fish. She smirked. Lady Naoki really was half cat. Shame she had already eaten though. Jun hadn't cooked for someone in a while.)Jun's father took his time catching up. When he did he would give a respectful bow to the Sun Marshalls. Jun would introduce them of course. \"Dad, this is High Lady Naoki, the current head of the state of Isra. This is my dad, Elder Raynor, leader of the Celadine Clan, and a member of the Elder Council. He was also the commander of the Land-Tiller forces during the Aaedanean crisis. If you guys ever decide to hold that summit he'll probably be there.\"Raynor smirked and bowed yet again, almost as if he was fond of doing that. \"My daughter speaks most highly of you. It's an honor.\"", "1471011558000": "Odd, Jun did not recall Lady Naoki being this tall. Eventually she came up for air and direct her attention to the floundering young girl at Naoki's side....Wow.For some reason Jun pictured Lady Naoki's main squeeze as a more dignified, aristocratic figure, as opposed to the bumbling horse-lover before her. One of Raynor's eyebrows practically disappeared into his long hair at the phrase \"Nice to shit you\". Jun's wide eyes followed Kate as she trailed after the horse that she was apparently only now coming to terms with, despite the fact that it was their horse. Raynor smirked and nudged Jun's shoulder. Jun shook her head. \"Uh, Miss Green? Are you... hungry?\" She called out, stating the word \"hungry\" with such trepidation to suggest that even saying the word might cause Kate to lose what was left of her mind.\"Jun, we should tell the others to prepare a feast.\" Raynor then called out to the horse girl. \"How would you feel about dinner in an hour?\" Jun turned to Lady Naoki. \"The Sun Marshalls don't have to stay in the carriage if they don't want to. I think we have enough guest chambers for everyone. They're also welcome for dinner.\" The father and daughter would beckon Lady Naoki, Kate, and the Sun Marshalls to follow them towards the base of the stone tower. As they turned they would exchange looks, as if to say to each other how many more weirdos are we going to have to contend with today?Speaking of which, \"Oh, one more thing\" Jun would say. \"We also have another guest. He's, well, we don't really know anything about him but he seems to be a refugee from Goraia.\" They gestured over to the strange man drinking tea next to one of the fields.", "1471323725000": "Kate Green's unusual behavior quickly left her mind as Jun and her father began to mobilize some of the villagers. Raynor made the announcement to whoever was still in close proximity that several honored guests were now in the village. Word was spread, and it was decided that a decent-sized feast, an impromptu party if you will, was in order. Kate, Lady Naoki, and the Sun Marshalls were invited to explore the Hills to their hearts content, get to know the villagers, or even show off their cooking skills if they wanted to help out.\"I recommend the in-door gardens. Those are neat.\" Jun mentioned in passing as she went to work.Raynor would smirk as Jun herself joined in the fetching of various legumes and grains from the stores and harvesting of plants. His daughter was blissfully unaware of her celebrity status it seemed. He wondered how Kate's perception of Jun would change if she found out that the \"cape\" she was wearing wasn't a sign of status, but rather a sentimental article from when she was a little girl she wore to help her feel more at home. The only reason why it was black was because she had it dyed in Medan to match her Verri servant garb, which she received from then Princess Camilla.***At some point,\u00a0Raynor of the Celadine would address the mysterious refugee, who would no doubt still be lost while everyone else was doing their own thing. He put his arm on\u00a0Enigma's shoulder.\"You haven't actually told us your name, son.\"", "1471750687000": "\"Oh Kate! I completely forgot! Naoki told me about your gardening expertise!\" Jun beamed. There were little beads of sweat on her forehead from carrying things, but she was in a perky mood. \"Guys, you can come with me and I'll give you a preview!\" With one hand she carried a large burlap sack. With the other she took Kate by the hand. It was about time Jun showed the two ladies the inside of one of these stone towers. She led them to a stone archway and drew them in.The corridor was, of course, made of stone. But there were odd, glowing bricks inlaid into the stone which gave them a decent amount of light. It appeared the tower was climate controlled as well. Lady Naoki in particular (and maybe a Sun Marshall if one decided to come) might notice a rudimentary glyph system built into the walls. It was similar to what the Gauldish\u00a0used, if more primitive. As Jun lead them down, some other land-tillers would go back and forth through the corrider. Some would bow politely, knowing who Naoki was. Others would make an attempt to wave with a single hand, too busy trying to not drop the contents of their arms. All in all the villagers wanted the foreigners to feel welcome.Jun would lead them to a bustling kitchen. It was a large room, with many counters and a few fires lit by fire magic. There was minimal smoke, but it was quite warm. Several villagers were already at work. The air was permeated with the smell of herbs and the sound of knives tirelessly beating stone. There were enchanted cooking implements of various types scattered about, gifts from Belrow and Isra. Jun sat the large sack down and hoped over to a particular cupboard where she kept one of her prize possessions, a special knife given to her by Rowena Fletcher.\"I'm gonna help make a veggie stew with lots of herbs and spices. You can watch, or you can help out! Same goes for you Lady Naoki, if it's not beneath you.\" She winked.By virture of her feline nature, what might attract Madam Naoki even more was the smell of fish. A variety of river food had been brought to the village just a few hours ago. If she decided to explore the rest of the kitchen she'd find freshwater shellfish, prawns, large silvery fish, sea weed, oysters, etc etc.***As for Raynor, he would be busy directing the other villagers while also making last minute attendances to his farm. Some of the solar lights floating around the gardens were beginning to go out. It was nightfall, and the Land-Tillers found it best to respect some of the plants' natural cycles. The glowing glyphs would become somewhat more prominent in the dark, giving the gardens a somewhat alien air to them.He found it unfortunate the mysterious boy had run off, but also a tad suspicious. He instructed a friendly mage and archer he was acquainted with to keep an eye on Enigma  . Once dinner was ready he would still be invited.", "1472185546000": "Jun snapped her fingers. \"Oh, right, I'm sorry. Uhh...\" She quickly darted over to a closet to find some extra aprons. She found a rather funny looking one, dyed pink and with flowery frills. She wasn't sure if it was meant to actually be used in the kitchen or if it was some sort of costume...Huh.There were two of them.Jun shrugged and grabbed them both. It would be kind of adorable to have Kate and Naoki in matching frilly aprons. Their matching styles would help accentuate the irony that their personalities seemed rather divergent. Jun did notice that the formerly disastrous Kate Green seemed right at home, while the graceful Naoki was being dragged along for the ride.Clearly Naoki wasn't used to spending time in the kitchen. While her bowl of leeks was immaculately cut, they had taken several minutes longer than usual for a chef. Jun assigned them both to\u00a0chopping more vegetables while Jun herself brought out Rowena's legendary knife, with which she deftly decimated a bunch of carrots. The plan was to put them into a very large, enchanted pot which would heat from the sides as well as the bottom, creating a convection of heat energy to cook the large amount of food in about half an hour. One of the other attendants was getting the coconut and milk ready. This was an experimental dish, the coconuts recently imported from Carmela Island.A few minutes into the whole process, an until-now hidden glyphic system, etched into the ceiling, would suddenly pulse with blue light. To Naoki's relief, the stench of fish and overall heat of the kitchen would vanish, at least temporarily. Jun grinned with pride. \"We're getting used to using magic runes and glyphs. We learned all this stuff from Gauldin.\"She had to restrict a girlish giggle at their matching aprons.Both of them were helping immensely, truthfully. It wouldn't be long before the feast would be ready.***Meanwhile, as soon as Enigma called out to them, the mage and archer ceased trying to be sneaky. \"We just wanted to make sure you were ok!\" The male archer said. The mage, a female, nodded in agreement. \"Yah, and you're still invited to the feast! It should be almost... ready...\" The female suddenly grew tense when she sensed another presence. The pressure of whirling, malevolent magic gave her goosebumps. \"Are... are you feeling ok? Are you alone?\" She said, somewhat panicked. The archer took notice of the change in the mage's demeanor, then shifted his eyes\u00a0towards where Enigma's voice was coming from. He took a few steps back.Raynor was almost done attending to the farms and inspecting them. Suddenly he was curious how his daughter was doing. Then again he was equally curious about that strange young man. Who to check on first?", "1473131078000": "Luckily for Lady Naoki the soup was essentially done. Jun had run off to another station to gather some ingredients and toss them into the pot. She then returned to Kate and Naoki. \"Ok you guys are good. Thank you so much!\" Jun took the arugula off of Kate Green's delicate hands. Jun had to admit her smile and demeanor were enchanting. Jun adopted a similar grin almost immediately. Kate's energy was truly contagious. As she walked towards another station with the arugula, she made sure to pass right by Lady Naoki. If Naoki was quick she'd catch Jun slyly glancing back at Kate's direction, then back to Naoki, and finally a wink. It was essentially a seal of approval, a good job Lady Naoki! She's a keeper!Jun tossed the arugula into a large wooden bowl, along with some pine nuts, cherry tomatoes, and an odd substance\u00a0which resembled dressing. \"I'm gonna help finish up here. You guys should head outside.\"***At about the same time Raynor would see Enigma being escorted back to the tower. He would stand there with his arms folded for a brief moment before heading to the other side of the tower.The BanquetIt was now nightfall. With a bit of earth magic, some torches, and a few wards, a large picnic like area had been set up. There were stone benches and chairs, enough to seat the entire clan. At the center was a long table where the fruit of Kate and Naoki's labor would become apparent. The \"soup\" was a spicy vegetable soup with a coconut milk based broth. It had been given a touch of sweetness via imported pineapple. The dish was considered a success by the chefs. Hopefully the guests would agree. It would be dubbed \"Carmela Island Style Land-Tiller Curry.\" In addition to the soup there was a variety of seafood based stews and, to Kate's liking, a wide variety of salads. There were also limited portions of grilled yak and wildebeest meat (only elderly animals were killed for their meat). For dessert was a type of fruit based bread, a hybrid of Gauldish\u00a0and Land-Tiller cuisine (for simplicity's sake it resembled a panettone, only with a much higher concentration of dried fruit pieces), and of course, fruit salad. To drink there was imported wine from Gauldin, water, yak's milk, and an odd sweet beverage with pieces of fruit in it and crushed ice (again, for simplicity's sake a Salvadorean Ensalada).Because of the\u00a0wards used to keep insects away, the entire area had a pleasant bluish hue accented by yellow-flame torches on stone pedestals. The air had an earthy, flowery scent which wasn't overbearing. The Celadine farmers would occasionally steal glances at High Lady Naoki and whisper excitedly. Everyone was dressed casually and seemed to be in a good mood.Jun would sit next to Kate Green, who would sit next to Lady Naoki, who would sit next to Raynor near the center of the area. Raynor would inquire of Lady Naoki, \"High Lady, tell me, how much attention would you like to attract? I can keep your introduction short or I can wax poetic about how you have graced our humble village with your august presence.\" He said this with a mischievous grin.***Enigma would be gently escorted to the banquet area. If he was observant he might catch the mage and archer looking over at Raynor. Raynor would nod slightly, and Enigma would ever so subtly be encouraged to sit at a table near the center, but longitudinally positioned to the master table, and with Jun and the Sun Marshalls in between Enigma and Lady Naoki. In between talking to Naoki and the others, Raynor would glance at him whenever he got the chance. Jun herself would see him and wave politely.The escorts would head off to join their families for the banquet, but not before whispering a few things to some of the other, more formidable looking members of the clan.", "1473494912000": "Jun's father nodded. He would keep things brief. It didn't take much to get everyone's attention. As soon as Raynor cleared his throat a wave of silence would seem to propagate through the entire affair.\"An impressive display is it not? For us to come together so readily to celebrate the arrival of an honored guest. Let us take pride in our hospitality, for it is part of what defines us. And let us wear that hospitality like a jewel as we share knowledge with and learn from our new allies. May High Lady Naoki's presence signify more than just a political alliance, but a true bond of friendship between our people. Let's just hope she's not allergic to fish.\"After a short round of laughter, the people would look to Lady Naoki and raise their goblets. \"Here here!\"\"Oh, so that's why we did this!\" A young man cried out near the far end of the table, to more laughter.After the introduction everyone settled down and began eating.Jun turned to answer Kate's question. \"Uh... no, not really. As far as I know, he's just a stranger who got lost and needed food and water, so we offered it to him. He seems pretty lost.\" Raynor would pat Kate's shoulder and smile before moving on to talk to some of the other clan members, but not before giving Enigma a sidelong glance. After he left, Jun remarked to Kate, \"My dad has mixed feelings about him.\" After taking a swig of her fruit drink, she decided to start having a real conversation with horse-girl. \"So, Miss Naoki tells me you're into gardening?\"As for Madam Naoki, she would be plagued by an unexpected phenomenon. Periodically, every minute or so to be precise, someone would come by and offer Naoki a small gift. It would be a semi-precious gemstone, a small figurine or wooden carving, a pouch of rare herbs, a vial of medicine, or even a small sweet. Individually each gift would mean little except to a small child. But after a while they would start to add up to a little treasure trove. Jun found this amusing. (As a Sun Marshall she'd also point out that she did not sense any suspicious magic in any of the items.)***While Enigma was eating, some of the other Land-Tillers would ask him various generic questions, such as \"Where are you from?\" \"So what's your story?\" and \"How do you get your skin so smooth?!\"However, he would eventually be approached by a messenger, who shy whispered, \"After the banquet, Elder Raynor would like to speak to you privately.\"", "1473716488000": "Jun beamed back. This was a good night. She needed this. Life had been so stressful that she was glad to just sit back, eat some good food, spend time with friends, and reunite with the clan.When she asked her about her adventures, she became a little excited. \"One of my adventures... Hmm, oh, wanna see something cool?\"Jun raised one of her hands into the air. She whispered, \"You can come out.\" A glittering flash burst from her hands, and when it subsided she was gripping a bright, metallic blue longsword. \"Meet Resonance.\" A few of the nearby clan members pointed with a few oohs and aahs. Jun didn't like to show off her equipment or combat prowess when she was at home, so even they didn't get to see Resonance very often. \"Neat huh. The craziest thing is that it's alive. You can't see it but it's actually... well it's kinda hard to explain. It's sort of a... a sentient construct. It was created by Professor Echoes in Gauldin. Its consciousness is modeled after that of his young son who had been lost in the fabric of time and space. I'm a bit fuzzy on the details but somehow his consciousness managed to reach out to him, and with my help and the help of this thing's older brother, we managed to revive him. Resonance will only serve someone who performs good deeds periodically, so I kinda have to stay on my toes. But it's extremely powerful, and no one can steal it. When it's not in its sword form I can actually see it floating around me as a small fairy. Neat huh?\" She waved the sword around carefully. It was highly reflective, but it also seemed to give off its own faint light. The sword was extremely sharp, but it would not harm anyone without Jun's permission.Finally Jun noticed something odd about one of the gifts Naoki had received. \"Oh wow neat! Who gave you that?\" Jun pointed into Naoki's basket, singling out a chunk of ancient amber with a trilobite inside it.\"That's a rare form of currency among many of the clans. If you go into the Saskatoon mountains, you can find various fossils, including trilobites. No one really knows how they got there, but there's an old legend that tells of an evil god who once ruled over the Saskatoon mountains. They say that the animals rebelled against the tyranny of the god and traveled into the mountains to fight him. Most of the animals died trying to get there, but the lowly trilobite, a creature from the waters, somehow managed to crawl up there. Their fossils can be found at the highest points, which means these humble creatures were the ones who came closest to reaching the god. Of course no one knows if the story is true or not, let alone how a bunch of crustaceans managed to fight a mountain deity, but those fossils are symbols of bravery against insurmountable odds. People usually keep them in glass orbs, but that one seems to have its own covering. Interesting.\"Jun hung her head a bit in playful shame. \"Sorry, I've been monopolizing the conversations a bit. But yah, Lady Naoki, you should definitely hold onto that. To us that's worth a gold nugget. Not that you need the money but, you know, sentimental reasons. Whoever gave you that respects you a lot.\"The Land-Tillers were a reasonably intelligent people, but even they did not have any knowledge of advanced paleontology.It wouldn't be long before another messenger, an attractive young female with a disarming voice, spoke to Enigma. \"Uh... hi.\" She said shyly. \"So, Elder Raynor asked me to tell you that you're not in trouble. Also, he wanted to ask if you wanted to just talk to him right now instead? He says he can be on the other side of the tower in five minutes.\" Her pretty hazel eyes widened a bit. \"You have really nice skin!\"", "1474230984000": "Jun grinned as Kate shook the sword's hand. She winked. Next thing they knew Resonance would appear in Kate's hand by the hilt.\"He likes you.\" Jun said, giving Kate a chance to wave it around before it would disappear again.As to the inquiry about what trilobites taste like, Jun frowned. \"Uh... I mean... I'm sure they wouldn't taste kinda good.\" She didn't want to say anything but to suggest eating one was kind of rude to her people. But she would try to let it go. \"Supposedly they're all gone. Although, I've heard rumors of a pool hidden somewhere in the Expanse where they still live. They say a strange man in Isra resurrected one in front of the Land-Tiller's first delegates there. But it's just a rumor.\"The flirting between Naoki and Kate was amusing. God they were such a cute couple! Jun blushed, somewhat aware of her third wheel status. Although... knowing Naoki and her... openness... She was still somewhat traumatized by her solicitation involving Artemis and Calico. Jun wondered if kate knew about Naoki's tendencies.\"Speaking of cryptids, Kate. Got any weird, rare, and special plants in your collection? Tell me more about your gardening hobby! How did you get into plants?\"As for Naoki, most of the conversations she was listening in on would involve fairly typical subjects. How are your kids doing? Is little Mana going to qualify for the Wizard's Tower? Raynor's been teaching me a new farming technique! So I met this girl from the Ivy Clan. How was your trip to Gauldin? I've never seen an airship up close before.There were other conversations too.Lady Naoki is pretty. What species is she? There are so many foreigners visiting us now. Are we sure that's a good thing? Elder Havador is getting so old. Why do people keep re-electing him? I heard your cousin died during the battle for Aaedan. All the other nations are so strong. We should get stronger. Why did we have to go rescuing another nation when they used to hate us? The Gauldish don't respect us. They think they're better than us. I kinda wanna join the Black Tower, see the world, do some traveling. Goraia scares me. I heard Jun hates them even though they used to be friends. Do you think Jun still cares about us? She spends so much time away from home. When is Va'nei going to come back? Are we going to war again soon? I hate war. My parents survived the civil war. Eh, Jun's overrated. Her grandmother was way more powerful.Lady Naoki may or may not like everything she was hearing.\u00a0", "1474693961000": "\"Our connection to the earth is complicated. I could go into detail about it but it gets tiresome. Long story short, Va'nei blessed our land, and we are continually blessed by it as long as we respect and nurture it. So honestly, it's just thousands of years of hard work. It's in our blood. But you know, a lot of times we take it for granted, unlike you. You love plants more than anyone I've ever met.\"Jun was really starting to fall in love with Kate, er, in a platonic way that is.Jun yawned. She and Kate talked at length for some time. Most of what Kate had to say was fascinating, except for the economics bit. Jun wasn't much of a money person. Eventually the party died down. Some people were starting to hug each other and say good bye. There was no formal end to the banquet. People could leave whenever they wished.Jun looked around. She didn't see her dad anywhere. Come to think of it she didn't see their new guest anywhere either. \"Lady Naoki, Miss Green, I'm gonna go look for my dad. If you wanna go to sleep, just ask the people where the guest quarters are in the stone tower and they'll show you, unless you wanna stay and wait for me.\"***Jun would ask around and eventually be directed to the other side of the stone tower, where Enigma and Raynor were talking. \"Oh, hey guys! It's kinda dark over here. Euuh.\" She was in a cheery mood, having made a great new friend.That's when she would notice Raynor's solemn face and Enigma's fearful one. Immediately her cheeriness went away. \"Uh, what's going on? Is everything ok? Is something wrong?\"", "1474744227000": "Jun's eyes grew wide. \"Oh god, you must have met- Did he destroy your home?! Is that why you're alone? I'll kick that thing's ass.\"After Raynor told her to calm down a bit, Jun thought for a moment. \"Well, if I remember correctly, it breaths anti-magic fire. If its fire can be avoided, long range magic spells might still be able to hit it. Also it wouldn't stop the caster from using magic on themselves. Any magic that uses physical objects to deal damage would still work. I remember when I fought the undead king Jorech. He didn't seem to appreciate me hurling giant boulders at him. Our Acacia archers could shoot his eyes, and our Havburg cataphract warriors could try to charge him. I think there are lots of ways to deal with it if we know it's coming. But we wouldn't know until we actually fought it.\"She turned to Enigma. \"Why? Is it following you?\" ", "1475018560000": "Jun slammed her fists together. \"If it means teaching that bastard a lesson we'll build you a goddamn fortress to live in! You'll get plenty of food and water, we can teach you how to farm, plenty of guards, but you can still have guests. Who knows? Maybe we can get you a special friend from the Ivy Clan...\" It was Jun's turn to wink. \"You can start a whole new life here. What do you say?!\"", "1475394315000": "Jun would later return to the party just as it was winding down. She was excited about the prospect of giving their latest refugee a new home. However, she would also let her dad worry about the details. It was back to High Lady Naoki and the incorrigibly adorable Kate Green.She'd find the pair huddled off in a corner, Naoki's tail wrapped playfully around Kate Green's behind. She chuckled mischievously and then sprinted up to them.\"BOO!\"Since Lady Naoki was gifted with superhuman hearing, Jun expected her to be aware of her presence well in advance. The idea was to scare Kate Green more than anyone. She'd poke her head right in between them and place her arms around their shoulders.\"Sorry, couldn't help myself.\" She then promptly let them go, realizing she might be forgetting herself. Lady Naoki was still one of the most important people on the continent after all. \"So, uh, do you wanna go for a walk around the farms, check out the interior gardens, or just go to your quarters and turn in?\" The latter suggestion was given a slight downcast overtone. Jun was suddenly feeling giddy. She had a whole host of ideas about what to do with them and secretly did not want them to go to bed right away. \"We can also go to the top floor of the tower, check out the view...\"Maybe it was the fact that Jun hadn't properly socialized in a while that had her so buzzed? It had been a while since she had truly just \"hung out\" with people, like friends, normal people, instead of\u00a0mercenaries and kobolds.She suddenly snapped her fingers repeatedly. \"Orrrrr... Kate, I assume you don't use magic to grow things. Do you wanna see my dad's pet project? ... *snort* The design isn't quite ready yet. it'll probably be a couple of months before we see what it can really do. But...\" Jun started grinning uncontrollably. \"It's uh, it's a very cute design, let's just say. I think you'll appreciate it. Who knows? Maybe you can help improve it. Oh, actually, it'll have to wait until tomorrow morning if you really wanna appreciate it. It's my turn to take care of them anyways. Don't suppose you mind getting up at the crack of dawn?\"", "1475787188000": "Jun blinked in surprised. She might have ducked, or perhaps Resonance would have interceded to block the new weapon. Just the same she thought it was interesting, and appropriate, for one of the High Lady's most beloved companions to be armed. She didn't recall seeing the enchanted weapon before though. Odd.Although disappointed at first, Jun perked up when she heard Kate mention breakfast, as if lingering insecurities of Kate being sick of her presence already evaporated instantly. \"Eating breakfast together sounds great!\" She said. \"Ooh, I should cook for you guys. We can take it on the go. Trust me. You're gonna love my dad's project, and I really think you could help improve it. If it works it'll probably be the most successful, and adorable, non-magic farm we've ever created. But I'm not gonna spoil the surprise.\" She grinned.In response to Naoki Jun says \"Wha-? Oh.\" Her reinvigorated enthusiasm melts into a demure, somewhat puzzled smirk as Naoki wraps her prehensile tail around her wrists. \"Uh, yah sure! I mean... guest quarters...\" She allows herself to be dragged along, only passively mystified at how Naoki seemed to know where they were going. She occasionally shot a few confused glances towards Kate Green.She was rather dense when it came to these things.***The stone tower's glyphic system was now emanating an ever so subtle red light. It was warm and comfortable. The stone hallway echoed with the chatter of a few late night villagers who decided that they could handle their farming responsibilities even while hungover. Their party walked right by a special room filled with medicinal plants. The door was partially closed, but a brief passing glance revealed several bags of herbs, a few rolls of bandages on wooden shelves, and a sweet, cinnamon-like scent. Finally they came to the end of the corridor, where a stone platform was waiting for them.Jun guided them to stand on the platform. She waved her hand over a glyph on the wall, and the platform began to rise up. They would pass by several floors with relatively dark corridors, all bathed with the same subtle red glow. There was an exception: One floor was filled with brightly glowing wisps floating over several indoor plants (Jun was visibly disappointed; she wanted to show this floor to Kate Green).Eventually they made it to a floor which could be surmised to be somewhere in the middle of the tower. It was completely dark and cold, save for an opening at the end of the corridor which allowed some moonlight in. Jun waved her hand over another glyph near the platform. This caused some slabs of stone to close over the opening, and a glowing light to fill the room. \"I'm really glad we made friends with Gauldin. When I was little we had to take the stairs.\" She then walked them down the hall to a new door, one of several. \"Yah, let's go with this one.\" The opening was a perfectly ordinary wooden door.Naoki and green would find themselves inside a quaint, primitive looking living room. There was a fireplace (which Jun promptly lit with but a wave of her hand), some simple looking wooden furnishings covered in cotton or feather-based cushions and decorative tapestries, and a wooden shelf with a bunch of scrolls piled neatly on each level. Along the walls were more tapestries, some charts with some cryptic information about plants and animals, and a few pleasant paintings of natural landscapes. There were openings to the outdoors shielded by wooden covers on the far wall. Jun walked over and opened them up, revealing a pristine, cloudless sky filled with stars.\"I grew up in a place just like this, except with more toys and what-not.\" She said, somewhat distracted by the stars.  A few seconds later she swiveled around and gestured to the side. \"There's a bedroom in there. You can sleep on straw mats, soft mattresses, or hammocks, depending on what you prefer. Oh and there's a personal washroom off to the side. There's a magic-based water system so you can bathe, although it's traditional to just use a warm bucket and clean rags since it saves water and is more efficient. But hey you're royalty so don't hold back on our account. It's also quite clean and there's no umm... smell.\" She then leaned in and said in a hushed tone, \"The, umm, waste, gets treated and then used in some of the fields.\"She then sighed with relief. \"Any questions?\" She flipped her hair back with a pleased-with-herself smile.(Presumably the Sun Marshalls would be similarly escorted by other villagers.)", "1476431094000": "Jun raised an eyebrow and her mouth parted into a bemused grin. Kate's inquiry seemed rather absurd. \"Uh, I mean, they're beddings. There's uh, nothing peculiar about them you just kinda lie in them and sleep and, I mean you could hardly offend us by sleeping. Sleeping is one of the more harmless things a person can OH! You two wanna...!\"Realization struck Jun's brain like half of a sun beam. The other half had unfortunately overshot its target. \"OH! Oh of course. Oh pssh you two can do that as much as you want. In fact these stone walls are quite umm, sound proof.\" She grinned. \"Oh of course that's no problem at all. In fact when I was young me and a gentlemen from a nearby clan we use to I'm going to save that story for another day.\" Jun gleefully trotted into the bedroom and gestured the others to follow her with a flick of her shoulder-length black hair.The bedroom was just as cozy as the living room, with its own window and tapestries. It was unusually warm despite the portal to the open night air. There were two stone elevations next to the wall. Jun stared at them for a bit quizzically and then raised her hands. The stone platforms slid across the floor with a deep scraping sound until they touched each other. Jun nodded with satisfaction before hopping to the side to grab some rolled up mattresses. \"I like to stack one on top of the other. Makes the whole thing uh, bouncier.\" She took a coarse, almost burlap-like mattress clearly filled with hay and dumped it on top of the elevation. She then took a much softer, more luxurious mattress filled with feathers and cotton and dropped that on top. \"I do not recommend the hammocks. I tried that once. Didn't end well. Umm, oh you'll want these.\" She pulled out some hand-knit quilts and draped them onto the bed, along with some large pillows. \"Oh and uh, hang on.\" She rushed out of the room. Naoki and Kate would hear the sound of shuffling paper. It was apparent she was going through the pile of scrolls. \"Nope, not this one, not this one... oh where is it? Ahah!\" Jun came back into the room and unrolled a large scroll, which had printed on it a naked man and woman covered in labeled dots. \"I recommend you memorize the red dots. They're the erogenous zones. Did you know some guys like it when you... Er, I guess that's immaterial to your present situation.\" She rolled up the anatomical diagram and gleefully placed it on to the bed. Finally she snapped her fingers. A number of scented candles which Kate and Naoki might have missed when entering the bedroom suddenly lit up, casting flickering orange patches throughout the room. The air was also slowly permeated with the scent of jasmine and vanilla.Jun seemed absolutely pleased with herself now. \"There. You two should be good to go. I'd ask if you want protection from downstairs but I guess technically it's not necessary. We Land-Tillers aren't whores or anything, 'cept maybe the Ivy Clan [she said this faux under her breath] but we're very open to talk about this sort of thing so all you had to do was ask.\" She beamed. She was swelling with pride, aroused with joy, rather cocky that she had anticipated their every need. Her ego was practically throbbing. What could she have possibly missed?\"Why are you two looking at me that way?\"The other half of the sun beam had made an arc through the metaphorical ether and was attempting its kamikaze run into Jun's cerebral cortex yet again.", "1478226569000": "Jun obediently sat at Kate's request, and then proceeded to stay. She was wondering if she would receive a dog biscuit in short order for her obedience. Then the little gardener plopped onto her lap, somewhat unfortunately for Jun since she was arguably the smaller member of the group. \"Eugh!\" She grunted as the girl bounced on her crotch.Uh oh. \"Huh...\" Finally the sun beam had hit its mark and Jun at the very least began to consider the possibility that she was gonna be a part of a flesh sandwhich. Her fears only grew worse as the massage began (technically making her part of a flesh sandwhich already).But, that said, the massage did feel good.\"Hey, guys, I don't think this is a good idea- oh.\" Jun's neck craned back and she gave a slow, pleasurable gasp as Naoki happened to hit a certain spot. How did she know? She didn't even read the chart!\"Um... Massages are good. I like massages. Um... Could you do that one spot again?\"She was so comfortable she even began attempting to massage Kate's back with one hand. She needed the other to stabilize Kate so she wouldn't slip off her lap. Her feelings were mixed, but a part of her told her to just go with the flow for now...", "1482007392000": "\"Mmmm? Mmm. MMM!\" Jun's whines made her feel more like a annoyed kitten than an obedient dog, but she obeyed and plopped face down onto the bed. Her face squished sideways into one of the pillows, giving her lips a melted look.\"I'm not gonna regret this am I?\" She said to Naoki with a muffled voice.The soft lavender candles continued to flicker in the background. The air remained warm but fresh thanks to the windows in the other room. Jun couldn't help reach for a blanket and embrace her it with her arms and thighs beneath her, a bit like a child wanting to feel safe.She surrendered to the massage, for now. She definitely could use the stress relief.Whatever happened, Jun would have to concede that Lady Naoki and Kate Green were certainly not the worst people she could receive this treatment from. And she was curious about Kate's skills. Could those petite hands rub away all the worries of the world which rested on her shoulders?Kate would find quite a few knots.", "1485797906000": "Jun submitted to the massage as long as she could, writhing and moaning as her muscles unraveled and became as soft and malleable as the day she was born.But what to do? She knew what was going to happen, and that it was more or less inevitable. She had set up the environment herself, dressing her own coffin as it were. But Kate's massage was too much. Again, all the right spots...F*ck it.\"Naoki, could you come closer?\" She said in the sweetest, kindest voice she could muster.If Naoki so much as got within a foot of her, Jun would wave a hand, and a light construct hand the size of a pizza tray would materialize and fling Lady Naoki onto the bed next to her!Jun would then fling herself next to Lady Naoki and then place her hands on Naoki's shoulders. Her initial grip would be rather tight.\"Sorry high lady, I'm just so so soooo very sick of being on the bottom all the time.\" An evil grin appeared on her face and her lithe but tone\u00a0hands overlapped each other, just before she targetted a spot on below her shoulder blades.Jun was about to teach Lady Naoki the true meaning of deep tissue massage!", "1486184306000": "Jun began to laugh quite loudly. Here she was, roughhousing with the most powerful woman on the continent. Then the blouse ripped off.It was as if the air itself had frozen.Jun stared, agape, the corners of her lips quivering as she fought back a smile. \"I... was just gonna give you a massage.\"", "1486400814000": "Jun's face turned a beet red as she sat and listened to Naoki's rebuke. She remained paralyzed right up until Naoki had actually left the room.But as soon as she did, Jun stood and stomped into the living room, completely ignoring anything Kate Green had to say. She froze when she saw the sun marshall. Her face contorted, cycling between disgust, guilt, fear, and full-on anger. Her lip trembled. She couldn't see Naoki's full face from behind the large chair, and therefore was unaware of her exact emotional state, but she caught a glimpse of the edge of a bushy tail swiveling as it wrapped itself around her feet. She didn't dare approach for fear of having to engage the sun marshall.\"You know what?\" She said, shifting her gaze between the sun marshall and chair. Her voice trembled as if she was on the verge of tears, but seemed to be building up.\"MAYBE THAT'LL TEACH YOU TO STOP TRYING TO F*CK ME EVERY FIVE SECONDS! YOU THINK JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE THE HIGH LADY YOU CAN COERCE WHOEVER YOU WANT INTO BEDDING YOU! AND NOW YOU'RE UPSET BECAUSE I HAPPEN TO LIKE THINGS A LITTLE ROUGH!\"Her words were immediately followed by heavy panting. Before Naoki could respond properly Jun tore the telepathic choker off her neck, threw it on the ground, and shattered it beneath the ball of her foot. Immediately afterwards, there was a bright burst of light from Jun's body and a loud crack.She was gone. She would not return until morning.The flames in the fireplace went out, along with all the candles. The smells of vanilla and jasmine would quickly fade away.", "1488387688000": "If Kate were to seek out some breakfast the most logical place would be back downstairs in the communal kitchen. There were a few ladies already at work making a large pot of savory-smelling porridge. Sunlight greeted their faces through small openings in the stone walls. Nearby was a basket filled with ready to eat fruits of various colors.And hiding in a corner, next to a counter with two trays laying on top, was Jun. She would appear smaller, almost anemic, in contrast to the big ladies stirring the massive porridge pot. It was likely an effect of the lighting, or lack thereof, in that little corner. She was wearing some plain, unremarkable beige robes that seemed suited for the outdoors. Upon closer inspection, Jun would appear pale and have bags under her eyes. She was sipping a tea from a small, wood-carved mug of some kind. The trays would have sliced fruit and porridge and a more elaborate ceramic tea set on top.When she saw Kate, she'd wave, but she wouldn't make eye contact. Her face was cold and bitter, though not expressly at Kate herself. She seemed to be staring at a little patch of light which was slowly crawling its way up the wall opposite the kitchen's openings.", "1488951178000": "Jun's eyes came to life. \"What? Really? You mean... she's not mad?\"As if her stomach suddenly started to function a little better, Jun drank her tea with more gusto. But she wasn't quite ready to attempt solid food yet.\"Kate, I don't know about this. I've never... Look, I was mad. I know Naoki has her way of... doing things. And I know sexuality isn't supposed to be that big a deal but... Look I shouldn't need a reason to say no. And I shouldn't feel, well, scared to say no. But she's the High Lady. Saying no is like jumping through a flaming hoop. And well, I don't like not feeling in control. I hate it. Maybe it's a character flaw I don't know but I just hate it.\"Jun finally took a bite out of a slice of fruit. \"So I did what I did because I just wanted to feel like I was in control again. I wanted to feel less afraid. Uh, heh.\" A trace of a salacious grin surfaced on her still somewhat cold face. \"When me and Vaelar, um, did our thing, I was used to being on top. Light construct handcuffs you know. I used to sometimes grab him by the- I'm just gonna stop there.\" Jun chuckled a bit.\"Kate-\" She looked her in the eye. \"I do wanna apologize to her. But I want her to know how I feel too. Just because she's a political powerhouse doesn't mean she can have whoever she wants in bed. And her power does make it hard to say no. She needs to be more responsible with that power-\" Jun's monologue was interrupted by a hearty yawn. \"I'm really starting to regret not sleeping last night. Heh.\"", "1490236084000": "Jun grinned at Kate's empathy and was able to eat comfortably after she left. It was as if her stomach's knots had undone themselves so that she'd be able to digest things properly.Once she was done eating, she got up and prepared to start the day's errands, but her knees gave out as soon as she started to walk forward. \"Maybe I should take a nap.\" She mused to herself.After doing the dishes, she told one of the guards to deliver a note under Naoki's door.IF YOU NEED ME I'LL BE IN MY ROOM, A FLOOR BELOW YOU, SECOND FROM THE LEFT FACING NORTH. - JUNWith a flash, Jun disappeared from the kitchen.", "1492065401000": "The door swung open.While the dark circles under her eyes had not completely dissipated, Jun's demeanor at the very least seemed much more refreshed. A simple nap and a bit of mental rehearsal had done her wonders. \"Kate, Madam Naoki, hi.\" Her voice was soft but optimistic. She didn't smile, but she didn't frown either. Her expression, like her mood, was tentative, perhaps a bit fearful. As if physically enervated her frame leaned on the door as it swung slightly, and seemed to rely on the doorknob for stability as she back up and tried to welcome the pair into her home.\"Please, come in, come in.\"The room was not all that different from Naoki and Kate's guest room, the same basic trappings: tapestries, candles, organic, nature-revering artwork, all very primitive. But there were some notable exceptions. Jun's room also had a number of low key magic artifacts, potion brews, and notes scattered in key places, like her desk and couch, and her bed should the pair venture into her bedroom. Towards the rear of the room was Blackbean, sitting on the window sill, in his miniature form of course. He observed the trio, his head cocking to get a better look at them with his ears.The odor was a bit different too, much more human, though not necessarily offensive to the olfactory senses; there was simply no attempt at hiding the scents with lavender or jasmine. Jun herself remained in unremarkable beige robes.\"Here, let me just clear a spot for you guys to sit and... uh...\" Her lithe hands reached down to scoop up any papers that remained on any cushions. She searched the room for somewhere more viable and settled on dumping everything onto the desk. \"Uh... so yah...\"Assuming the two sat down, Jun cleared her throat, though did this little to change her tone. She looked to Naoki. \"Uh... one of us will have to go first so... me, you... I guess those are our only two options... hehe.\" She smiled nervously.", "1492711742000": "Naoki would actually be able to see the color rushing back into Jun's face, a barely perceptible shade with every sentence. When Naoki was done she steeled herself to prepare a similar response.Despite her rehearsing, she took a few beats of her own to reply. \"I'm sorry too.\" She inhaled a fair bit. \"Maybe you did overreact. Maybe things could have been settled another way. But it doesn't change the fact that the way I handled the situation was wrong too. I, I was uncomfortable. I was scared. And the truth is I handled it in a way which reflects one of my character flaws, something that I haven't quite been able to get over, holy mage or not.\"She raised her hands a bit, as if trying to hold the words together with her will. \"Lady Naoki, even since I was little, I've had a certain flaw. I can't stand giving up control of a situation. My lust for power was driven by my competitive nature. But my competitive nature comes down to control, my need to not lose control. It's something I've only started to meditate on recently. The knowledge there are forces in this world that can control my destiny, well it bothers me. I don't like being at the mercy of other things, or other people. Power is one way to avoid this, although it isn't always the right way.\"A bit too much color entered her face this time. \"When it comes to sex... Giving up control is hard for me. When it comes to dating, being vulnerable is hard for me. The truth is, I've just, never been interested in pursuing that avenue with you. But I was afraid to outright resist because you're the high lady and are arguably the most powerful woman in the world right now. The truth is, I'm afraid of you. And deep down inside, that angers me... That anger came to a head last night.\"Jun paused, seeing if either Kate or Naoki would have anything to say before she continued.", "1494693343000": "Jun's mouth slowly went agape.\"I see.\" She closed her eyes lurched back against the chair. Her neck craned up to the ceiling almost as if she was in pain.\"Oh I can't believe I did that to you.\" She exclaimed, perhaps more at herself than at Lady Naoki. When she brought herself forward again, it was with a heavy, disgusted sigh. For a while her gaze seemed fixed on an important nothing on the floor. Then she looked back to both Kate Green and Lady Naoki.\"... I've never, uh, I've never had my... sovereignty violated before. In fact it's a very rare occurrence in the Expanse. But, there was a time where that wasn't the case, the civil war. I remember my Grandma telling me about the necromancers and how they believed in the superiority of magic wielders. At one point they... well they had camps. She told me the stories. She was a very open woman. She didn't like to shield me from the truth. As soon as I entered womanhood she was all too excited to teach me everything that entailed.\" Jun chuckled briefly. \"My dad's squirming was hilarious. Anyways... I had heard the word before, that word that I don't wanna say. And I wanted to know what it meant. So naturally I asked her. And it's strange, but at first I didn't even understand what the big deal was. I know that sounds insane, coming from a fellow woman, but I was young, maybe 11 or so. This was shortly before my grandmother passed away. But I just didn't get why it was so terrible And then... Grandma told me the stories of those camps. The necromancers saw lesser people as animals. They were flesh to be abused, slaves. And...\"Jun went pale. \"I vowed that I would never EVER let that happen to me, that no one would ever be powerful enough to force themselves on me and make me feel like garbage.\"She sighed. \"Maybe that was her plan. I've never really thought about it before.\"There was a brief pause of contemplation if Naoki or Kate wanted to say anything.", "1497673579000": "Jun did not reply right away. She let the words mull over in her head a bit.Cease to seek intimacy...Finally, she said, \"Lady Naoki, you're my best friend. Alright? And let's just be honest, you're surrounded by people that will have sex with you at the drop of the hat. I'm not one of those people but, you should know, you are my best friend. And I'll always value our friendship no matter happens and what decisions you make. It doesn't mean I'll always agree with you, or that we won't get into arguments. It doesn't mean we'll always understand each other. But, well... Ugh just-\"Jun decided to fuck all and give Naoki a nice big platonic hug if allowed.\"You can look at my behind as much as you want you strange cat person you.\"After they seperated, she would add, \"I just don't want you to think less of our friendship just because we don't periodically exchange bodily fluids.\"", "1499753080000": "\"Yah... You may have a point.\"Once they separated Jun fell back in her chair. The feeling of relief was comparable to finding out that you didn't fail that math test you really should have failed. After a few seconds, she suddenly shot back up.\"Oh! That reminds me! There was something I was going to show you, a new type of farm.\"Looking less like an exhausted student and more like a bright-eyed child, Jun walked briskly towards the door. \"Come on. Come on!\" She beckoned as if desperate to put the whole episode behind them.---Assuming they heeded her call, she would lead them back down the tower and out into the fields. It wasn't a very long walk. It would take them past some scenic hills and irrigated valleys, dotted with simple-robed land-tillers working with tools and casting spells. There was one particular field they were headed towards, a field filled with verdant rice stalks interspersed with small, clover-like ferns.At first it wouldn't seem all that extraordinary, but nearby were several large crates from emanated a fervent chorus of... quacks?\"They aren't native to the expanse you see. We actually got them from Gauldin. They're a bit of a nuisance but we found a bunch of uses for them, and frankly I think they're cute. We're still training them. I was supposed to arrive sooner to release them but I think they'll be alright.\"When she got close enough, she raised her hands towards the crates, whose lids flew off.A mass of wings and feathers exploded out from the crates. Ducks. Dozens of strange, almost regal-looking waterfowl with green crests and fluffed out brown manes scattered across the field and started diving into the plants. They seemed to be feeding on something voraciously.One of the royal looking birds, for whatever reason, took a detour from the main group and instead landed right in front of Lady Naoki and Kate. It looked up at them coolly without making a sound, as if it was waiting for them to commit a crime.Jun chuckled awkwardly.", "1501189005000": "The duck looked up at Kate's infatuated face, then darted forward to steal the apple slice, as if this precious offer was only available for a limited time only.In the meantime his fellows were traversing the field from one end to the other. Every few webbed steps each one would peck at something, then continue forward until it was time to peck at something else.\"Do you see what they're doing Kate?\" Jun beamed. \"They're eating the insects and weeds and helping to aerate the mud. Their droppings are helping to fertilize rice stalks. Take notes.\" Jun proudly stepped towards the edge of the rice paddies. She bent down and plucked some of the fern-line plant that was growing along with the rice. She showed it to Kate. \"Azolla fern. It helps keep mosquitoes away and feeds livestock and chickens. Neat huh. I'm hoping this becomes one of the best non-magic farms in the Expanse, and the cutest.\"The duck that had swallowed up the apple piece once again eyed Kate, still not sure what to make of this large mammal who doth bear edible bits. But then it started waddling over to the even more enigmatic cat girl.\"Oh, yah, he's kinda... well he's different. Quacks to the beat of a different drummer if you will. But don't worry he's really friend-\"It started frantically pecking at Naoki's tail, its fluttering wings making quite a ruckus as they beat against the air.\"-ly.\"", "1503202163000": "Jun's lips pressed together and widened, as if the crease between them had forgotten what curvature to take to either smile or frown. She muttered the phrase \"Vokri\", and after a few seconds Naoki would sense little strands of auburn hair start to prickle their way out of her tail's follicles to take the place of their fallen comrades.The duck had waddled off somewhere, still carrying the fuzzy bundle in its beak.\"Now I may be wrong...\" Jun said in a drawn out, somewhat academic tone. \"But I believe he mistook your tail for a fox's, which are natural predators of ducks. He's a real knight in shining armor, that one. I'm thinking of naming him Foxbane... er, that is, assuming his assault on your person doesn't constitute an act of war on Isra.\" She chuckled nervously. \"Anyways, the ducks will continue their work. I don't think I had a chance to properly answer your question. We may want to check out the new elven spiritual center on Mt. Silver. It sounds boring but-\" She leaned in and whispered loudly, \"-it's basically a spa.\" Her eyebrows waggled slightly, in the hopes that the duck incident would quickly evanesce away like deja vu.", "1507248566000": "\"Well, no time like the present.\" Jun grinned and started to search through her clothing for something. \"Where did I put the thing... do do do oh here it is.\" She pulled out a scroll and unrolled it, revealing a complex pattern of concentric circles and rune formulas.She paused. \"There's, er, something of a joke, I guess you could call it a friendly sport, circulating among the people. You see, this place is meant to be taken seriously. The elves who live and toil there consider this place to be a solemn place of healing. However... y-you get bragging rights if you can get away with... certain things... things you might be inclined to get away with... High Lady, and Miss Green.\"If there were no objections, a bright flash of light would emanate from the scroll, and the three would be carried off to Serenity Pass.", "1582866228000": "\"... Blackbean's put on a few pounds.\" Jun answered dryly.Despite her poor attitude, Jun reciprocated by pressing against Vaelar's forehead, embracing the therapeutic tugging of skin on skin. Her throat creaked audibly, a failed attempt at a sigh of relief. The colors of the world were muted. The verdant hills may as well have been drawn in with crayon. The sun violated her pores. The air did its duty by keeping her alive, perfumed by the false promises of the latest spring blooms. And the virgin blue skies were filled with the distant howls of faceless, hollow gods and unnaturally large beasts, singing with voices of war trumpets just over the horizon.The sight of Vaelar's enchanted arm pressed against her whole body like a cold block of concrete. The guilt of putting Vaelar into such a dangerous position, and the desperate need to just keep going, together pulled her apart, making sure she could go nowhere until she had been sufficiently drawn and quartered.What felt good, ironically, was when she raised her own arm to the sky, still wrapped in fresh bandages, still taut with esoteric gore. It reminded her that she had reverted back to being a moron, a self-reproach with the inverted effect of comforting her. When it came to trauma, often the rules were backward. Her badge of honor, her second-place trophy from her most recent Darwin Award competition, reminded her that life had already punished her and that, fuck, it was ok to go out on a picnic with your boyfriend once in a while.\"That one kinda looks like Boscoe.\" She lied.She let her hand fall on Vaelar's lap, her gambeson cushioning the drop. Lately, it felt like she couldn't go anywhere without it. It was warm. It was heavy. It was like a portable hug. It would shield her from an assassin's arrow or a bandit's fireball. Sometimes it felt like her only friend.\"I hate myself.\" She said out loud in an exasperated tone.", "1583119970000": "Jun allowed herself to be ragdoll'd on top of Vaelar, her body providing so little resistance that her head actually rocked back and forth slightly against his chest. She was unresponsive to his assurance that everything was going to be ok. That was just a thing that people said.But the warmth against her head was nice. It wasn't like her gambeson. It had a heartbeat. It was alive with musk and sweat, although thankfully Vaelar was one to bathe regularly. Her gambeson had a bit of life in it as well, but it wasn't really the same.Wait, they had honey butter rolls? Oh yah, that a few minutes ago. Now she remembered.\"... I'm inclined to agree. Your honey rolls were expertly crafted, with just the right amount of honey and butter and roll. They were sweet, and fluffy, and you used just enough salt to bring out the flavor without ruining it. I thought they were wonderful. You're a good baker. Baking is a wonderful art, a worthy art. You know Rowena Fletcher taught me a bit of baking? You don't know who that is probably but you should know she's a good baker. I should have been a baker. Baking doesn't possess animals or raise the undead or set things on fire... oh well I guess it can do that if you're bad at it. It certainly doesn't collapse kingdoms or cause people's arms to explode or cripple people's lovers or constantly pressure you to have to keep getting stronger and stronger and make you addicted to its vast power BECAUSE THIS WORLD IS FULL OF F***KING C@CK SUCKING SUPERPOWERFUL ENTITIES THAT WANT TO CONTROL AND MANIPULATEANDKILLEVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE EVER KNOWNANDLOVED AND JUSTWON'TF**KINGLEAVEYOUALONE!\"Jun's limp body suddenly gripped Vaelar tightly with enough strength to cinch a barrel. Her eyes welled with tears which could be felt through Vaelar's shirt mere seconds later. She raised her hand and pawed and grasped and Vaelar's cheek with her good hand, her fingers shaking and uncoordinated. Her sobs were muffled by cloth.\"How do you pronounce the second thing?\" She whimpered.", "1583272717000": "Jun's body slowly went limp against his body. Her eyes lay staring against the lime green of the grass' refracted sunlight, while her lungs seized and struggled to regain control of themselves. Eventually, her yelps and gasps of emotional pain died down into ever steadying breaths.Her head raised up, as if she had awoken from a trance, or a short nap, and then she turned to look at Vaelar.\"My face is a crehm-schnit-eh.\" She then let her head drop onto him in embarrassment. She chuckled slightly as Vaelar's reassurance started to take effect like fast acting medicine.\"I deserve to have a demon crehm-schnit-eh all over me.\" Her bared teeth were being re-appropriated into part of a salacious grin.\"Is that a crehm-schnit-eh in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?\"Her eyes were still red and her cheeks were soaked, but Vaelar had done his job. Finally her head lay calm against his chest.\"I'll be honest, I could do without the ego-feeding part of your speech, but everything else you said was great.\"She closed her eyes to let herself recover some more. She stretched out her hand to interlock her fingers with Vaelar's.\"I don't deserve you.\" She sighed contentedly.", "1587080151000": "Truth be told, it took a minute of silence, Jun quietly staring off at the growing grass, to absorb Vaelar's words. Their heartbeats came into sync, agitated flames steadied by still earth. \"Maybe you're right. I've been so caught up on trying to be a hero, I've forgot how to be a person.\"Jun carefully rolled off Vaelar and flopped into the grass. She shimmied herself up slightly so her head was more at level with Vaelar's, and then she took Vaelar's hand. Now they could look up at the sky together again as equals.\"I wanna dance with you again someday... But I don't really wanna learn how to dance. I just wanna fly through the air with you, er, but on the ground. I don't know if that imagery made sense. I wanna cook for you. I wanna cook with you. I wanna make magic with you. The spiritual artistic kind, not just the sex kind, although that's fine too.\"She gripped his hand tightly. \"I wanna stop feeling like shit, so I can be a real girlfriend to you, a real human being.\"She turned to look at him. \"And I think you're right. I'm gonna visit some friends. It's been ages since I've seen Camilla, and I heard Doobie's started a whole family! Remember that little female Kobold we helped rescue?\"She sighed. \"And it's been ages since I've brought Alden's children gifts. Oh I was going to teach them some magic as well.\"A funny thought occurred to her.\"Vaelar, maybe when I'm done trying to keep the world safe... we should think about settling down and having children.\"", "1468817871000": "Jun was in flight, riding upon her demon crow Blackbean. It was all she could to to focus on gathering mana instead of shouting a rapid succession of expletives. So much for vacation.As she approached the Savannah, she saw several warriors, as well as Land-Tiller troops, converging towards the creature. She was determined to defend her birth land and help these warriors as best she could.Resonance was held above her, glowing fiercely. If nothing else she was looking forward to testing some new spells. (C1)", "1468911407000": "Overhead a loud screeching sound would ring out. Those who looked above would see something like an arrow gliding through the sky, only much larger and made completely of fire.The \"arrowhead\" was Jun atop her mount. The spell was a little something her father had taught her recently. As she glided towards the battlefield, the air would start to feel just perceptibly warmer. A few seconds later some of the soldiers would start to feel invigorated with a benevolent presence. A few seconds after that, some of their weapons would erupt into flames, particularly arrow heads.The fiery presence would in particular zero in on individuals who did not already have mana welling up within their bodies. It was a battlefield equalizer. In particular Sidarin Ves and @darkanaarez would find the destructive potential of their arrows and melee weapons vastly improved against the beast. The Land-Tiller archers and Elizabeth Finch's griffin riders would also notice the buff, though for some reason the fiery presence favored the two hunters more than anyone else. It was quite likely because Jun had only recently learned the spell and, unlike her father, hadn't had time to master it. So its scope was limited.Jun would continue to circle in a blaze, maintaining concentration so that her powers would benefit anyone who didn't already have magical abilities or any other advantage against the creature.", "1468993764000": "It was at this moment that the area where Catriona's arrow found purchase would suddenly light up in flames. While they didn't do much more additional damage, the little flash of light amidst the fog might serve as a beacon of hope for Catriona and Sidarin. Their arrows wouldn't be quite as ineffective as they thought they'd be.Jun flew back and forth in the air above the combatants. She was closer now than ever before. Sharp eyes would perceive a girl riding a large bird-like creature, though exact details would still be obscured by the flames.The presence Jun had summoned continued to zero in on the non-magical fighters. Now, as Catriona struggled to breathe, she might feel a calm warmth in her lungs and a surge of adrenaline to help her focus. She may or may not notice softly glowing embers beginning to dot her skin and clothing. The same would be true for Sidarin.The Land Tillers' State's forces were hanging back, trying to regroup while other fighters joined the fray. Now that Jun was closer, they were starting to notice their arrowheads were lighting up as well...It was worth noting the contrast between @artofpain 's element of choice and Jun's. While the battlefield in general became warmer, it would not abate Kerynlos' spell in the least. It might however result in a foggy breeze encircling his aura. Whether this was a nuisance, advantage, or amusing curiosity was left up to him.", "1469167971000": "Commodore Finches' sacrifice would not be in vain. By helping out the Land-Tillers she had bought them enough time to regroup. By now their arrows were in full blaze. The fiery presence Jun had brought to bear on the battlefield was at full strength.The Land-Tillers fired a barrage of flaming arrows and fire spells at one of the creature's limbs.Meanwhile, Catriona's arrow, while in midflight, would suddenly erupt into a blast of fire, still directed towards the creature's head.Jun continued to circle back and forth. The fiery being she was channeling was remarkable. The way it used fire and heat to protect the army made her feel as though it felt genuine compassion towards the combatants. She could see why this was such a favored spell of her father's, and how useful it must have been during the undead invasion of Aaedan.", "1469539799000": "By now Jun had observed the battle for some time, and so had her benevolent fire... ghost... elemental... battlefield thingy.The presence spoke to Jun. That thing doesn't appreciate fire does it?Jun looked down at her compatriots and their allies. \"Huh.\" She decided to fly in closer. She made a wide circle and then went in, a wide, rapid arc which would more than likely draw the attention of the creature. For a brief second she would be almost in front of its face. More importantly she'd leave a trail of heat and fire which would likely rip a large hole in the behemoth's miasmatic defense...If she could avoid getting swiped out of the sky, she'd immediately pull up to a safe distance and prepare for another pass.", "1469679268000": "Jun flew like a blazing phoenix in the same direction as Vanei.<Exit>", "1462993241000": "Jun, with Koren's directions, sneaks along the brook, taking an inventory of all her equipment.Her magic sword Resonance, her armor, her helm charged to resist a single magic attack, a single buckler, and her pet demon crow Blackbean, who was large enough to be ridden but currently under a shrinking spell.In addition she received a silence potion, an invisibility potion, three healing potions, an anti-toxin, and a water-breathing potion from Koren.She decided her plan would be to sneak close to where she thought the clearing was located, and cast a detection ward to try to find any traps and wards in the area. Then she'd use the invisibility potion and water breathing potion to swim up the brook while Blackbean flew over. She'd hide underwater and charge up mana for the fight, and get the jump on Izujin's forces. If Blackbean encountered an anti-magic field it'd only make him stronger by dismissing the shrinking spell. Alternatively Jun could dismiss it at will.She went over her plan with her partner, Mobius Vauc'Tutt, to see what he thought.", "1463179793000": "\"Uh oh, we got company.\" Jun immediately started funneling mana into her sword (charge 1) as she jumped off the brook and into the more stable parts of the bank to gain better footing. (She didn't wanna engage in a fight in the middle of the brook.) She estimated the direction the creatures were coming from and entered a loose, defensive stance with her buckler facing forward in her left hand guarding her forearm and Resonance in her right. The buckler was a standard stainless steel, about 15 inches in diameter and with a domed protrusion. Resonance took the form of a brilliant sky blue, cross-guarded knightly sword with a double-edged, 30 inch long blade.Blackbean flew off into the air, still posing a normal-looking crow.\"Think maybe we'll scare them off?\"", "1463186474000": "Luckily Jun's senses had given her advanced warning. She feinted forward while quickly uttering the words \"bel nahl kun.\"Two luminous, translucent white objects shaped like horse shoes would appear with a bright disorienting flash, with each of the ends tapering into a sharp point. However, the goal was to knock the goblins unconscious, so as the the goblins ran towards her, the objects would materialize with an arm in front of each of their necks.The instant the objects appeared, they'd slam together in such a way as to make them interlock. Their trajectory would be angled downward slightly towards the ground in between them, to minimize the chance of ducking. The goblins' heads would be slammed together in between the horseshoes' pits before they could finish their spells, hopefully knocking them out without killing them.If successful she'd quip something like \"You tell no one.\"(Is it ok if I just take them both out? lol maybe we can take turns? I was expecting for you to wait for Mobius to post first, so that we have an established turn order, but then you went so I figured I'd just go.)", "1463198611000": "With Mobius' quick casting, Jun takes advantage of the distraction. Sensing the magical energies building up in the owl bears, She darts behind Mobius, holding up her sword and buckler to cover his back while gathering up more mana.The two light constructs she formed follow her, but their form becomes unstable and amorphous in appearance. They seem to be fusing together. (charge 1)Meanwhile, Blackbean continues to circle the battlefield.", "1463244835000": "\"Bel nahl kun!\" By recycling the energy from her original constructs, Jun is able to focus on creating two more powerful versions of the originals. The amorphous blob forms into a new shape, and with a flash another identical shape appears. These two constructs are much larger, about four meters in diameter. They are star-shaped blades, with the arms curving in the same direction. They begin to spin rapidly with a harsh shrieking sound...With Jun so focused on pouring her magic into the blades, she releases the enchantment on Blackbean, who rapidly grows into a ferocious beast whose wingspan dwarfs a horse's length. Its thick plumage is impervious to small bites. The creature shoes the bats away with a gust of wind from its mighty wings.Jun focuses one of her blades on the vines surrounding them, shredding them. The second blade arcs around the party towards the exposed flank of the mage owl bears at high speed. Still wanting to be at least somewhat merciful, the blade careens toward them at a low angle to decapitate their extremities and not kill them. Losing a leg or two should be enough to break one's focus on a spell.Jun trusts Mobius to take care of the three owl bears coming straight at him.", "1463257388000": "(Aww can't you just beat up the owl bears?Ok fine. Yah, technically the turn order should be Koren, Jun, Mobius, Koren, etc. Also when it comes to magic, the prep of a magic effect should take place one turn, and the cast the second turn. Prepping for another attack should take place on the third turn. It doesn't mean magic is slow necessarily but that the opponent has to be given a chance to respond to the threat of a spell, even if realistically they only have one second.This fight is already kinda wacky though. Any suggestions?)", "1463258409000": "(Since we skipped 2 turns when mobius could have acted, i think its fair his spell is powerful enough to take out at least one owl bear. The more turns spent charging, the stronger the spell.)", "1463274004000": "(So, there's another rule called no-auto hits. While it is possible to execute moves that characters have little to no chance of escaping, you can't outright claim that the opponent's character is automatically hit. For instance, when Jun cast the light constructs to take out the goblins, even though it was unlikely for them to avoid the hit, you could have technically said that one of them managed to duck out of the way or something, as long as it makes sense. In this case you're saying that an owl bear slammed Jun into the growth. But technically, Jun has to have a chance to respond, whether you like it or not. So if I can come up with a reasonable way to avoid that attack, then I can write it. Likewise Mobius has to have a chance to respond to the vines that are attempting to grapple him. You could also have said that the owl bears stopped casting and tried to dodge the light construct. That sort of thing.Since we messed up the turn order again, I think Mobius should go next and it should go Mobius, Jun, Koren, Mobius, Jun, Koren, etc etc. I don't think you have to change anything, but it'll be understood that the vines and the bear attack are attempts and not actual auto-hits.As you can imagine, TFS rules take a while to get used to (I still make mistakes sometimes), and disagreements do happen, which is when you have to call a moderator or the admin herself. And one more thing, if you're sincerely trying to kill us, just be aware than in game death is permanent. Characters that die are dead for good and cannot be resurrected by any means. There are no Phoenix Downs or Resurrect spells here.You can still make the quest really hard     , but next time try to keep to TFS rules, even if it slows things down. Mobius works full time and can only post a couple of times a day.)", "1463375977000": "Jun is now in a hyper alert state and considerably less merciful than before.As her first light construct continued to rend the vines, her second light construct would swing around towards the owl bears for another pass. Jun's mind would strain to maintain 2 focal points, even more so as the owl bear charged towards her.That said, her instincts and CQC lessons from Vaelar told her to quickly step to her right with her front foot, then back foot, while lowering her stance. The creature's charge into her buckler would come at an angle instead of hitting directly. The force would actually add power to the rotation of her torso as she deflected the charge with her buckler, and simultaneously thrust the razor sharp Resonance into its lower side. The creature's own momentum would do most of the work against the blade. The owlbear would most likely be struct in the heart and then disemboweled.There was no time to feel remorse. The effort would prevent her from charging another spell, so even as her body spun from the force of the blow she'd quickly steady herself and once again focus on using the constructs she had in play to continue the fight.Blackbean would fly overhead towards the casting owlbears, although with any luck Jun's second light construct had eliminated them.", "1463551199000": "(We miss you. =[)", "1463982926000": "(So, apparently Mobius' player quit. How do you wanna proceed? I can pretend to be both or I can try to solo, or you can adjust the difficulty.)Jun would use the invisibility potion and hide in some nearby brushes and begin casting a detection ward. Her next move would be based on what she finds.", "1464032439000": "Jun sees the deadly ward and realizes she can't get through it without being spotted, assuming she even survives. She decides the best course of action is to lay a trap. She begins to conjure a cloud of noxious, flammable gas using her magic. The gas itself would cause anyone caught in it to suffocate. She gently floats the cloud towards the guards and waits and sees what happens.", "1464119831000": "Luckily, Jun is still invisible, so although the creature knows where she is, he doesn't see what exactly she is doing. Not wanting to take any more lives, Jun would attempt to quickly slice at the creature's tendons and then bash him over the head with her buckler, causing him to lose consciousness.If successful, she'd take its pendant and wear it, sneak over to the second guard and take his pendant as well, put it over Blackbean's neck so it can follow, and then heads into the compound.The noxious gas cloud travels ahead of her, avoiding suffocating her.", "1464150667000": "Jun immediately thinks this is too easy.She decides to stay back and hide around a corner in case the invisibility potion gives out. She lets the noxious gas cloud float over to him and suffocate him in his sleep. If he tried to wake up, she'd immediately throw the open silencing potion bottle at his face to hinder his spell casting. She would stop just short of killing him, and tie him up as soon as he was passed out.Blackbean was hidden somewhere above them on top of a structure.", "1464241695000": "(She got one pendant from each of the werewolves outside and gave one to her and one to Blackbean)Jun gasped, and then smacked herself in the head. \"Well, so much for easy.\" She entered a defensive stance and faced Izujin. \"Ok, let's try a diplomatic solution. I'm here to retrieve all the items you stole. I was hired by the man you tried to kill.\" Her sword began to glow and the noxious cloud now began to circle everyone except her.\"I know what happened. You got sick and went after him in a fit of rage. You almost killed him, and almost destroyed his business. I'd say that makes you even. So how about you do the right thing and restore balance to the world and we won't have to hurt each other. Because for the record, this...\" She gestured around her at the cloud that Izujin no doubt already sensed. \"Is probably going to hurt at least as badly as whatever you're planning.\"Blackbean poked his head out to eye Izujin. Did his master need help?", "1464323356000": "Before doing anything else, Jun decides to carefully examine the bag for its contents. She hopes it really does contain most of everything that was stolen.", "1464540766000": "(Sry about the wait)Seeing that this was the most important thing, Jun decided to agree to Izujin's terms. However, instead of staying the night, she decides she would rather just leave immediately. Taking the bag, she and Blackbean would exit the fortress and, if permitted go home, do so right away.One more thing, just before they left the fortress, they would check to see if the werewolves outside still had a heartbeat. If so, they'd drag their bodies outside the barrier so that the barrier wouldn't kill them. They felt bad for having caused so much trouble, so they really hoped they were still alive. They decided to keep the pendants and give them to Koren as an extra gift.If permitted, Jun would ride on Blackbean's back with their cargo and leave the area.(Are we good? lol. Can I posted at Koren's shop?)", "1523992209000": "Jun appeared along with Daedalus in a flash of lightning, fists balled with hatred as she surveyed the destruction caused by the Wyld. In the distance she spotted the ring of mounted archers fighting around the ring. She suggested to Daedalus that some of his mages task themselves with casting a holy aura that empowered any people fighting against the wyld, and gift their their arrows with fire. She wondered which of the riding figures was her mother...She nodded to Daedalus. \"I agree. I've been thinking about it. The Expanse was blessed by the Earthwarden thousands of years ago. There is a lot of life and nature energy here. So maybe it spawned here so it could appropriate that energy for itself.\"She started rummaging through a pouch she brought. What she pulled out were some seeds. \"So maybe we can draw the remaining nature energy away from it into ourselves and use it to fight back. Vanei taught me to commune with nature while I was gone for a year. Maybe you can do something similar with these. They eat magical energy and draw it into you. It's my version of antimagic. But as life forms they are malleable and can adapt to your will. We'll gather the energy around the Wyld and keep it away from it while using it for ourselves.\"", "1524464782000": "\"Wow... What a nerd.\"Jun smirked as Daedalus left for the other side. It was comforting having such a talented mage helping the Expanse. It was strange. She actually planned on writing a complicated glyph and having him tap into the seeds' power as they emerged into nature energy vines. But then he went ahead and just ate them. And most bizarely of all, that worked perfectly.What a guy.\"I still have a lot to learn...\"As she watched the Wyld and Land-Tillers do battle across the field, she started breathing deeply. Her strategy was going to be a little bit different from his.She planted her feet together and folded her hands together. What was to follow would be in some ways her ultimate ability, something she had spent a year mastering deep within Va'nei's domain. In some ways it was a spell, but in a more profound way it was a rather simple skill. All she was going to do was ask for help. As her heart reached out to the world around her, something in the air changed. It was a faint aura, an unimposing one, like a light, wispy crystal. It had no color, and wouldn't even register on the senses of most sapient beings. It was an aura of softness and humility, of a being that understood that it was, ultimately, just a single spark in a great cosmic fire.Humility, kindness, and diligence were the keys.The first respondent was a single sparrow that landed on her shoulders. Then a moth fluttered up and sat in her hair. The creatures stared out at the encroaching Wyld which, at the moment, seemed convinced that it owned the planet and knew what was best for it.Jun didn't move. She continued to chant softly in supplication even as a curious centipede crawled up her leg. Several grasshoppers leaped up to her mage's hood and, using it as footing, crawled up to her shoulders to observe the petulant demigod. What an odd thing.As the seconds went by, flies and gnats started to form little swarms around her. A curious lizard leaped up  her front and crawled onto her wrist. It too watched the Wyld. What was the Wyld? Did it think it knew what was best for these creatures?About a minute went by, and progressively larger and larger animals began to appear, curious about the still, supplicant human. Several rats, then a deer, and eventually a pride of lions. Soon the ground around Jun was covered in orbiting shadows as vultures, song birds, and hawks circled above her.There was more to it than animals. While Daedalus' power blackened the earth from one side, the earth around Jun became increasingly verdant. Grass turned greener, trees became taller, vines and roots grew with such fervor that they trembled the earth around her.Closer to the Wyld, the grass and trees would begin to wither and dry in a manner similar to when Daedalus had discovered druidic energy. But for every blade of grass that shriveled, a new one formed closer to Jun. From the sky it would look like nature itself was retreating from the Wyld before it could control it.And this was Jun's intention, to deprive the Wyld of natural energy, of things for it to slave to its will, to turn the very thing the Wyld was attempting to absorb against it in a pocket of resistance. The end result of Jun's distress signal would be a field of natural energy where the plants and animals were greatly empowered. The wolves, wildebeests, snakes, and all manner of creeping things would begin exhibiting faint auras of fire and flame. They stood in front of the field as a phalanx. Many of these creatures were the very same that the Knights of the Harvest and the high priestess in charge of the TERRA's network had thoughtfully assured the safety of. The grass and trees twisted into the earth like clenched fists ready for battle. The creatures of the air too would start to swirl in various formations, alight with a new and untold power, waiting for the right time to be unleashed.There was one last side effect of the concentration of natural energy. With all the life force concentrating around Jun and away from the Wyld, the whithered and dry grass would allow the ever expanding circle of mounted archers to ride quickly and trample through more terrain without slowing down. It would also greatly magnify the speed with which the TERRA's holy flames could spread to counter the Wyld.Of course if the Wyld didn't want to have to deal with any of this, it was free to focus on the northern side of the Expanse, which was becoming increasingly infected with disease and death, things which the Wyld probably hated as much as any other organisms.", "1525142464000": "Jun sensed a presence, not of Vaelar, but of the manticore. This caused her to look up from her praying state just in time to see an old lover make his return.Her lips parted with surprise. She turned to look at him as well as the beast. She had to make sure she wasn't going crazy.Then a baby deer would headbutt him on his ankle.Her surprise turned into a demure little smirk, followed by a wink towards Vaelar. But she didn't say anything yet. Instead she turned to deal with the task at hand. She could see Daedalus' light show from miles away. And she knew she didn't want to be upshown by her rival.She looked to one side of the natural bastion she had form, then the other, and gave a serene nod to both.\"Let's do it.\" She raised her hand up, and Resonance appeared over her head. She grabbed it, and as soon as she did the sword erupted into white hot flames. She held it up just for a moment, then brought it swinging forward.\"Get'em.\"Vaelar would have to cover his ears to survive the simultaneous cacophony of roars, whistles, shrieks, and hisses of hundreds of large animals, thousands of small ones, and countless insects and creepy crawlies.The most visible effect was hundreds of ethereal animal forms being cast by their respective creatures. These forms seemed to leap out of the hearts of the creatures and rush forward like an army of ghosts. Phantoms of pure light and fire, these creatures would collide with the Wyld, headbutting, biting, stomping and gnashing their way through anything dark and evil, and then detonating with a burst of holy flames. These forms were not made of nature energy themselves, but were a power gifted to the creatures through a synergistic effect with Jun. Jun had absorbed the energy and used it to become a living wand, a weapon used by the earth itself through a mystical contract. This was her ultimate power that she could only use during the most desperate of occasions, the most powerful ability she had learned from Va'nei.Of course, the flood of fiery beasts was just the beginning. Even more dramatic would be the flock of dive bombing eagles, hawks, swallows, doves, crows, and many other species just above the edge of the Wyld. Their auras made them seem like phoenixes rather than mundane fowl. Just before they reached the Wyld they would pull up, but their auras kept going, showering the Wyld with thousands of missiles of avian fire. The explosions could be heard from the other side of the Wyld even through the TERRA's ring of fire, letting Daedalus know that his distraction had been put to good use. The darkened sky, filled with empowered fowl, also made a nice contrast against the tempestuous sea of fire forming below.The insects and plants played their role as well. The swarms formed a collective consciousness that swam through the air like a great glowing cloud of fire flies. Like the other creatures, they unleashed holy, fiery spectres forward, and a hail of stars flowed into the Wyld, eating into its vines like hungry locusts.Finally, the vines and roots of the earth rose up like writhing wings on both sides of Jun's little anti-Wyld. They tore the earth apart into great chunks. But these chunks looked a bit different from regular earth, as did the auras of the plants; both became emerald and crystalline. The vines and roots catapulted this holy earth forward, and as it landed among the forms of the Wyld it would shatter into deadly shrapnel, painfully burning and sapping all things of malevolent intent. Jun watched the holy carnage with a resolute look. She may not have been a chaos mage, but she would do her damnedest to punish the Wyld for all the suffering it had caused.", "1526618981000": "The firey specters fought tooth and nail until they were depleted, and their fires gradually died out. Aia and Vaelar would notice that the animals, once single-minded, started to wander off as if some great concert had ended. Oddly enough, the predators would leave the prey alone, as if they had struck a temporary truce. Meanwhile, the plant life began to recede, the great holy trees wither and dry up, and the swarms of insects fly off into parts unknown, but certainly away from the Wyld.Once the dark energy enveloped the Wyld, Jun decided this was a good time for her knees to wobble and for her to fall flat on her behind. So she went ahead and did so. The mighty Resonance clattered to the ground, the azure sword depleted of energy. She looked on with a mix of horror and academic curiosity. She went ahead and pet that baby deer that had headbutt Vaelar earlier.\"Well... offensively, I think we've done all we could. I gave it everything I had. If that attack won't stop it nothing will. Same goes for Daedalus.\" She sighed, her head wavering slightly as she leaned back, one knee raised. But she did give Aia an optimistic, if exhausted grin. \"But I think we at least showed it we're not the same pushovers we were centuries ago.\" She looked back to the Wyld. \"The next thing we should do is set up a perimeter. We have to quarantine this place and prevent anything living from getting close to that dark barrier, both people and animal. I'm guessing we wounded it badly enough that it needs time to recover, so it's turtling in there for now, like a wounded beast.\"Off in the distance, the TERRA network's attacks were winding down. Holy fireballs were still raining down on the Wyld's shield, but they were doing so with much less frequency. All they really wanted now was to prevent the Wyld from getting too comfortable. But the TERRA's three great beacons in the sky were shining bright as ever, particularly the one that linked to the Pheonix Temple. They were definitely planning something... Likewise, the remaining Land-Tiller forces were retreating, already forming a perimeter of their own accord. Great, lumbering figures still approached from the north, but they were slow-moving and still needed time to arrive. Their footsteps barely registered as the faintest of rumbles for those with gifted hearing.Jun squinted, and thought she recognized a familiar wilderbeest among the mounted archers. She would seem relieved.\"While it's gathering strength, we also need to get ready for round two. Anything holy works on it, but certain non-holy elements will make it stronger. Stick with fire and light. Oh god.\" She struggled to get up, but her body was woozy, and she would likely recline on Vaelar for support. \"I get the feeling that once Alden arrives with the sealing stone, we'll have to go on the offense again. So, again, in summary, focus on quarantining it while getting ready for another offensive push.\"", "1529348300000": "Jun gratefully wrapped her arm around Vaelar's shoulders as she struggled to stay standing. \"I'm alright, I'm alright.\" She mumbled reassuringly. A bit of optimism spread through her veins as her addled brain slowly started to assimilate the wonderful news that Vaelar had finally returned!\"Don't worry, you've left me far more exhausted than this.\" She murmured salaciously in his ears so that Aia wouldn't hear. He'd feel her fingers curling weakly against his pauldron, her other hand propping the rest of herself up by her knee. She was smiling, but pale and sweating. Such was the price of casting a spell that would have single-handedly obliterated a battalion of undead.\"So... I was in Isra when I got a call from the Citadel. We had a meeting and they explained that it's some kind of demigodic entity. It hates sapient life. It wants to revert the natural world to a primal state, without any intelligence, just instinct. It chose the Expanse so it could feed off all the natural energy here, and use it to assimilate all the life forms. It's only vulnerable to fire and light. It just eats everything else.\" She leered at it, as if that would somehow damage it further. \"It's a real pain in the nether regions. We've slowed it down but, we're waiting on my friend Alden to find a sealing stone to defeat it. And even then I don't think it'll make it easy for us.\"When the world stopped spinning, Jun finally gave Vaelar a proper hug. Her temple pressed against his plate armor, and her grip strengthened. \"Where have you been?\" She pleaded softly.", "1530686261000": "Jun had almost forgotten Vaelar's penchant for chivalrous, romantic speech. She was genuinely surprised he hadn't referred to her as \"my lady\" yet. Oh wait, nevermind.But all the same, she needed a familiar face right now, and Vaelar's was more than adequate. She actually felt somewhat guilty. Now wasn't exactly the best time to, er, celebrate in such a physiological manner. But if what the man was saying was true, he had likely gone for quite some time without any chance to celebrate. And of course, he had to come back to his girlfriend's home facing the poison ivy apocalypse.\"As much as I want to...\" She gently pushed him off. She was just able to stand now. \"I need to gather as much energy as I can. And well, what your thinking of would probably kill me at this point.\" She gave a hybrid grimace and grin, and winked. Seriously, the stars couldn't have aligned to make a reunion both so equally wonderful and fraught with disappointment.There was one last dehydrated tree remaining, and she carefully stepped back and leaned on it. She slid down, groaned as she got into a sitting, meditative position, and took a deep breath. \"Come sit next to me. When the time comes, I might be able to give you a taste of this magic business.\" She winked again, and then gave herself a questioning look as she wondered if her last statement counted as innuendo of some kind.", "1582593617000": "When she received the letter, her immediate reaction was a grin. You too huh?Slowly, Jun was learning to get out of the house more. The accident had left her a little embarrassed to be seen by the public. And she had convinced herself she needed to return to full strength before engaging in any fresh heroics.\u00a0But this, this she could handle.***Her gambeson was more for protection from the cold than anything. She walked briskly towards the Doobie household. She was excited. What had he learned after all this time? What could she share of herself? She struggled to remember the things Doobie had seen of her and things he hadn't. Her powers had changed a bit. She hoped Doobie would like the new her. She was concerned; hopefully she hadn't lost too much of her coolness factor.But that was for Doobie to decide.The mountain air felt good in her lungs. She really ought to come here more often.", "1582595991000": "\"You're... Doobie's daughter.\" She said, more to herself than to the kobold.Shit I've forgotten how to talk to people, let alone kids... let alone kobold kids. Think Jun, think.\"Not selling, buying. I'm here to buy some caramel cicadas. You got a few?\"She started rummaging through some hidden pockets on her gambeson. Apparently she was quite serious.A crow flew down from the sky and landed a few meters in front of the child. It turned its head and stared at her with a single black eye.", "1582599870000": "\"Silver moons, silver moons.\" She handed her what she thought was the correct coin (and was a little disappointed fewer people were using the semi-precious stones as currency) and grabbed a fistful of cicadas. \"Thank you kindly, madam.\" During the minute wait she popped a few in her mouth. She also tossed one to the crow, but he seemed uninterested.\"Right, I forgot you swore off sugar.\"She wanted to ask the child about the book, but she decided to wait a bit as the little kobold didn't really want to be disturbed. Also she was waiting in anticipation.And then, \"Doobie!\" She carefully bent down to give him a big hug. \"You look marvelous! Truly you have become a mighty mage!\" She suddenly remembered that Doobie was protected by a powerful guardian spirit. \"How is your stand doing?\" She wondered if druidic magic would allow her to sense its presence.", "1582659630000": "Jun lowered her head in a bow to Wah Doobie. \"It's an honor. I'm Jun, Jun of the Celadine clan. That's, that's how last names work in my tribe. It's not a great system.\" She said this while gesticulating a bit because she noticed that the child was known was Wah Doobie and not Wah Du Shoobie. It seemed everyone had their own way of doing names.\"When I left my tribe my father went through the same thing you guys are going through. I'm sorry. But if he's anything like you or I I'm sure Oobie will come back a great warrior.\" She smiled at the personality differences between Wah and Smoke. Maybe Smoke had some adventurer in her as well, but she had the sense to pour it into reading instead of slaying ogres.Jun jokingly hung her head in shame at the word trouble. \"Buddy, you have no idea. After the Wyld nearly destroyed the Expanse, I kinda slipped back into my old habit of training incessantly. Vaelar almost broke up with me... almost.\" She rolled her eyes. \"I also had a little accident so I can't use all the same spells I used to. I've been trying to return to my former strength. I don't think I'll ever fight quite the same way again, but I've learned to work around it... kinda like my grandma actually.\"She paused. She hadn't really thought of the comparison before.\"And now I can do other things too.\" She winked.", "1582768780000": "Jun supposed the relationship between kobold parents was a little more combative than with humans. Then again humans didn't always have the best parents either.\"Well, 6 is a multiple of 18. 6, 12, 18.\"Was Doobie really that old by Kobold standards? That thought made Jun sad. She wondered if this was how elves felt when they watched humans grow old.After Wah recounted his tale, Jun replied, \"Oh, that must have been terrifying! Your stand must be very strong though, for you to cause an avalanche at such a young age.\"She turned to Doobie. \"I never learned to manifest a stand. My grandparents' spirits have moved on from this realm, so they couldn't bond with me to create one. Oh, buuuut-\"Jun started rummaging through a hidden pocket in her gambeson. She pulled out a small scroll with a golden wax seal. \"While I was mastering my new fighting style, I created a bunch of new spells. I made this one based off of Starman.\" The scroll had the phrase \"Doobie du Shoobie Special\" written in ornate, cursive black ink. \"I... kinda wanna test it against the real Starman.\" She grinned sheepishly.", "1582777644000": "Jun followed Doobie into the arena. She walked slowly, wanting to show respect for the battleground, waiting for her combat senses to return to her. She almost had to remind herself that this was just a test. She was nervous. What if the new spell was weak? What if Doobie thought she was a failure? What if she had failed to return to full strength? What if she would never be the same Jun that had once been celebrated as a hero?Then she saw Starman. She could feel its immense power. Doobie really had gotten stronger...It had been far too long... since she had felt this way. Her heart beat faster. Her palms sweat. The energy surged around her body. The invisible but omnipresent power of the elements filled the arena and pushed defiantly against Starman's pressure.Oh... fuck yes.She closed her eyes and took a deep breath. She held the scroll forward. She let it go, and it sat there in the air.Should I do it?It started to pulse, an emerald heart beat refracting off the battlefield's many mirrors, splashing geometric shards of light all over the arena floor, cutting into the water ponds.I should do it. Oh it sounds so stupid when I do it though. No self respecting mage does it anymore.The scroll whirled with a harsh shriek of wind, like it was ready to burst.To hell with it. For old time's sake. I'll do the thing.It was totally unnecessary, but she clapped her hands together and bellowed: \"DRUIDIC ART: DOOBIE DU SHOOBIE SPECIAL!\"Gnarled vines and branches tore the thin scroll apart from the inside. They exploded outward like streaking lightning against the dark sky. They writhed and twisted violently and slammed and contorted into each other, filling the air with cacophonous creaking, thumping, and thrashing against the arena floor. When sufficient volume had been reached, the branches and vines rapidly intertwined into four limbs, a bulging torso, and a grarled, eyeless head with slicked back leaves for hair.\u00a0\"OKO OKO!\"Yah, it even had a catchphrase.\u00a0The golem slammed its massive burls for firsts into the ground, raised its towering form into the air, flexed its fibrous muscles, and even had the audacity to toss in a dab before taking a boxer's stance against Starman.Jun smirked devilishly. She hoped Doobie would be proud, or at the very least, not be too insulted.", "1582869586000": "Jun feels the injection of power from the star gauntlets as a radial pulse onto the battlefield. The sensation was like being around an old friend, a\u00a0very angry shiny old friend who punches a lot.\u300c OKO OKO!\u300d\u00a0The golem hopped up and down with floor-shuddering anticipation, only regaining composure right as Doobie's guardian spirit made its opening move. Jun's eye instinctively flicked not to Starman's punching fist, but to the retracted one. A left jab could easily be a faint into an uppercut or right cross (Thank you Vaelar!). Her own shoulder muscles twitched out of instinct, but of course it was the golem fighting, not her.\u300c O...!\u300d The golem raised its right forearm up, its whole body contorting, its knees twisting, its torso tightening. While this gesture could block Starman's left jab, it was really meant to switch into a straight punch towards Starman's jaw.\u00a0\u00a0\u300c KOOO!\u300dJun doubted from the beginning that her druidic copy would actually be able to defeat the real Starman, but a 700 lb mass of wood and earth heading toward's one's face at 40 miles per hour was no laughing matter.", "1582945898000": "Jun's spurt of pride at landing a blow was cut short as the foolish golem's eyeless head followed the star's twinkles.\u300cOko?\u300dIt draws its arm back when it sees the glow, but it's too late. Starman's uppercut sends chunks of wood and mud a hundred feet into the air. \u300cKOOOO!\u300dThe remaining half of the creature's head struggles to refocus on Starman even as its body staggers back.Shit! Jun winces.\u300cOoooooh... OKO!\u300dSuddenly it rights itself and leans forward.  Vines of fresh growth suddenly sprung from its torso and entered its fists like veins. Its head began to reform. Strangely, its massive, bulbous arms seem to shrink down. Doobie and their audience would see viscous wet earth writhe down to the creature's hips and legs and slough off its chest and limbs, dripping all over the arena like melted ice cream.\u00a0\u300cOHHHH...\u300d\"Oh he's pissed now.\" Jun taunts.The golem, now weighing less, was able to recruit more energy from its vines and transfer it into its fibrous \"triceps\" and \"biceps\". Trading mass for speed and twitching power, it lurched forward and unleashed a blazing succession of jabs towards Starman.\u300cKO KO KO KO KO KO KO KO KO KO KO KO KO KO KO KO KO KO KO KO KO!\u300d", "1583035730000": "Even Jun couldn't believe how fast the golem was. She was indeed a proud lumpy grass momma! But Starman was matching it blow for blow. She could feel the shockwaves in her chest, shaking her very organs. The air blasts batted her hair, and the earth's vibrations made the soles of her feet tighten against her boots. She could also feel the wood and vines creak, stretch, and snap under the pressure of such intense melee combat.Then the surprise attack came from above, and the shrapnel tore into its limbs even more. Jun gritted her teeth, but she didn't flinch.\u300cKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKOKO!\u300dThe golem tried to back up away from Starman as its form took heavy damage from the raining shrapnel. Its rapidly punching limbs were losing integrity, and so more chunks of mud and wood landed at Starman's feet and spray across the battlefield like gore. The golem was shrinking by the second. However, it would continue to unleash its battery of blows as long as it was able. Starman was winning, but perhaps Jun had built in a few more tricks up its grassy sleeves?", "1583116772000": "Jun took measured steps out from behind the golem. Her hair had been flung all over her face by the shockwaves, her gambeson was muddy, and her eyes were concealed by messy bangs. She stood silently facing towards Starman and Doobie.Then, she raised her hand.The mud that had drenched Starman's fists started to wriggle and writhe. Starman's body would glow a faint green. And then...Doobie's injuries would heal.\u300cKooooo...\u300dThe golem placed its fists together and bowed its head towards Starman, and then it broke apart, spilling inert mud and regular vines onto the ground in a little pool.Jun pulled her hair back, revealing she was smiling.", "1583453788000": "Almost as if on cue, Blackbean swooped down and landed on Jun's shoulder. It wasn't particularly interested in Dead Rock Star, not at first anyway, but rather it wanted to be near its master now that she was done regaining her confidence.\"It was an honor. Starman is incredible, and I'm glad my construct was able to give it a proper challenge.\"She gave Doobie a little bow. Now she quirked her eyebrow at the second stand. \"Is that Mr. Avalanche?\" She glanced at Blackbean.Blackbean fluttered down to the ground and hopped in front of Wah. He looked up at Dead Rock Star with one eyeball.\"I'll bet you wish you could cause avalanches,\" Jun jeered.The crow made bobbing motions with its head and rattled with its throat. It appeared interested in Dead Rock Star.", "1583632768000": "\"Hmm...\" Jun looked over at the mountainside above the Doobie homestead. She scratched her head. \"I mean, honestly it wouldn't take much to be able to cause an avalanche if you could sense where the weak spots on the mountainside are. It might not seem strong, but used strategically, it could be a very mighty stand.\" She spoke matter-of-factly and shrugged. Although she hoped Wah would be encouraged by her words, she was telling the truth.Blackbean observes Dead Roc Star carefully, and then it hops over to the nearest rock it could find and brings it to Wah's guardian spirit. He then hops away and looks for another rock.Jun turns to Smoke and smirks. \"So, what about your stand? What can it do?\"", "1583955136000": "Seeing young Smoke use her stand so skillfully brought Jun memories of when she trained with her grandmother. She remembered learning how to teleport with glyphs and lightning magic, and how she used to be able to zip around the battlefield. She quietly squeezed and tightened the fist of her injured arm. Someday she'd be back to full strength, but in the meantime she knew she'd find a way to compensate. Druidic magic was extremely versatile after all...She clapped along with Wah Doobie. Being able to manipulate space and time was no easy feat!\"I think, with this new generation, the world is in good hands.\"She looked around. \"Oh, I should probably clean up this mess.\" She pulled a seed from her pocket and placed it in the middle of where her golem had fallen apart. All the vines and mud from around the battlefield slowly started crawling their way back towards the center, being slurped up into the seed, which itself started to sprout into a small purple flower.\"Maybe someday, when you guys are older we can go off on an adventure together. I can show you guys more weird plant stuff and you can show me how your stands have grown.\"Blackbean, meawhile, is still bringing Dead Rock Star rocks.", "1584947767000": "\"Aww... Well I'm sure your friend is in a better place.\" Jun smiled softly. (Of course if she had known that Wah's friend had been annihilated by Xel'rath, she wouldn't have said that at all. She had worked with Xel'rath in the past, as he had been in the service of the Black Tower organization for a brief time. His presence bore somewhat of a resemblance to the entity known as Grandma, who was an inhuman and inhumanly powerful spell caster from another realm. Jun often wondered if Xel'rath was the larval form of whatever Grandma was, but she never got around to asking them.The point was that Appopo was probably not in a better place. Oh well.)When she heard Doobie's voice in her head, she nonchalantly walked over to a nearby boulder in the arena to sit down and rest. She casually stared up at a cliffside and muttered something about needing a break so as to not arouse suspicion.<<Trogdor's back? Shit.>>Doobie would see an image of Jun, Empress Naoki, and Trogdor out in the middle of a forest, negotiating some sort of treaty. He'd also see a strange, small sword, cursed by an evil presence.<<Trogdor was exposed to a dark energy. I think it had something to do with the darkness in Zaltos' soul. Something was left behind after the Phoenix State collapsed. Maybe his light went into the other realm while his darkness was cast out and remained here. I was able to purify the sword, so the darkness isn't invincible. But if Trogdor is back and is being influenced by more of that darkness, that's really bad news. And if I had to guess, that presence might have possessed your son as well, which is blocking your telepathic link with him. If I'm right, we should try to find him and cleanse him of that darkness.>>It was hard for Jun to maintain a straight face while rattling her theory off in her head, but she convincingly seemed to think the clouds floating just above the cliffside were very interesting. She even tossed in a stretch and a yawn for good measure.", "1585715019000": "AS the stand grew in size, Blackbean backed off. He puffed up his feathers a bit in alarm.He reminded himself not to be jealous. After all, he could grow bigger too.A surge of electricity went through Jun when she realized Wah was actually a boy. Miraculously, she had managed to avoid referring to him with any gendered pronouns. She was very, very careful to avoid revealing these thoughts to Doobie.<<Your son is very cute.>> *slight nervous sweating*\"I appreciate it. Yah, we should go on an adventure together someday. Even though I'm injured, I've been working on new spells and gear to compensate. I'm far from helpless. I swear, if you and your family ever need help, I'll come running. And I'll bring help.\" She said this last part with a wink.She observed Wah training for a while, studying his technique. Then a thought occurred to her. \"Have you guys tried combining your powers together? You and Smoke? I'll bet you two could come up with some interesting combination attacks!\"", "1586225011000": "<<I think it's cute. Anyways, most humans wouldn't judge how a kobold child dresses himself. Hehe.>>\"Fossils huh?\" Jun smirked and started rummaging through her things.\"There was a legend among our people about an evil god who ruled over the Saskatoon mountains. It is said that the animals who once lived here rose up to challenge the god, but the god would strike down anyone who got too close. Most animals were killed, but there were some that were able to sneak up on it and defeat it, because of how slow and small they were. Creatures from the ocean, imbued with the blessings of spirits, proved its downfall. That's how our people explain these.\"She pulled out a small trilobite fossil, encased in a heavy, crystal-like glass. \"Unfortunately the libraries of Isra possess an alternative explanation for the existence of water fossils up in the mountains, one which is a lot more boring and logical. These crystals used to be very valuable currency, but their price dropped quite a bit after we started trading knowledge with the Isra people. Kinda unfortunate actually...\"She tossed it over to Wah so he could catch it. Even if he missed, it was hard enough to survive hitting the ground without a scratch.\"And as for combination attacks, I figure you could hurl rocks through the portals as a sort of sneak attack. Smoke makes the portal behind your enemy and next to you, you send a giant through the one on your end, and SPLAT!\" Jun slammed her fist into her palm with an evil grin for dramatic effect. \"Yah, you could probably do something like that with Starman's shooting star attack too. I'm sure there are many possibilities.\"", "1587083937000": "Jun's mouth gaped. Her hands were on her knees supporting her half-standing body.The trilobite would burst out of its glass shell. Jun would give a little wave of her healthy hand to push some of the glass away, as if she was helping a baby chick out of a particularly tough egg shell.This act made Jun wince slightly, as the act of using her own body as a magical conduit caused pain to her injured arm. But it was minor enough that she could hide it. She reminded herself she needed to use other life forms for assistance when casting, at least for now.She stood up and bent down closer to observe the little thing. \"That's amazing! Good job, Wah!\"<<That's incredible, Doobie. I've only seen one other person resurrect a trilobite or any sort of fossil, and he was a demigod.>>Blackbean fluttered back and observed Rock Star's final transformation from a distance. He conceded that he definitely couldn't pull off something like that. What the frick, Jun? Help me get more interesting powers besides growing bigger and having shrinking and expanding cataphract armor and... well ok those are pretty cool but still! >:[Jun bent down carefully; maybe she'd pet it if she felt it was ok. \"So is it, is it really alive again? Or is it some kind of construct, like an earth titan?\"", "1587496247000": "Jun reached down and wiggled her fingers in front of the marionette.Seeing an ancient creature come back to life and dance around like a puppet, Jun actually lost herself. Briefly, she was entranced, playing with the creature like a child. She was smiling, genuinely smiling.And then thoughts of Wah wielding an ancient dragon or dinosaur of stone into the battlefield clouded her thoughts. Jun went through a brief few seconds of introspection, wondering if it was perhaps unhealthy that her first instinct was to weaponized any new spell she encountered, or wonder how it could be pushed to its full potential. For the next few moments, she just wanted to relax and play with the trilobite.Before she knew it, she had placed her hand next to the trilobite and joining it with a little dance, even humming out loud.Doobie would receive an image in his mind.It was a trilobite standing on the closest thing it had to hind legs, in a long, flowing ballroom gown, spinning and flowing to the music of a waltz.<<Haha. I'm really glad I came to visit. Thank you for having me.>>She was content to sit and relax, trading spells and stories for the rest of their time there.", "1508112041000": "Empress Naoki and Kate Green would hear Jun take a deep breath, satisfied breath right next to her. \"Refreshing, isn't it? I made the teleportation scroll a few weeks ago.\" She said proudly. \"But I just haven't had time to check it out. I heard it's hard to leave once you're into it. There's still a bit of walk since exercise is supposed to be part of the cleansing process, but I promise it won't be too difficult, more of a leisurely stroll.\"Most of the stone arches punctuate a path leading to an ancient-looking stone arch bridge, which itself leads deeper into the mountain. The first arch is flanked by two statuesque, young elves (relatively speaking; elves are known to live for centuries). They were wearing thick tunics with multiple layers. One was apparently male, and the other female; they had similar length hair, however. They both waved serenely at the three ladies.\"I know you're infinitely wealthier than me but please, allow me.\" Jun reached into her pocket and pulled out some semi-precious stones and a few Isranian coins. \"Don't misunderstand. This isn't a toll, but rather a donation. They also take food and clothing. They're basically monks.\" She took a few steps forward, bowed respectfully to the elves, and deposited the baubles into a large clay pot.\"Alright, whenever you- OH SHI-\" Before she could complete her phrase she covered her mouth; she didn't want to use profanity in front of the elves. The male of the two noticed and grinned as if he wanted to chuckle.\"I forgot about the Sun Marshall guards.\" She said with an amused grimace.", "1512623583000": "Jun chuckled. \"Bath is good. Let us bath then.\" She bowed politely towards the monks. \"Follow me guys...\"Jun would start leading them down the ancient mountain path. Ornate stone guard rails kept the path secure. The roar of a distant waterfall harmonized with the breeze. Gnarled trees with verdant leaves and branches clung fast to the softer spots of the earth in the mountainside. The further along they traveled, the more the path seemed to split and take different routes. Strangely, Jun seemed to know exactly where they were going.\"So here's the thing.\" Jun smirked guiltily. \"You're supposed to let this place surprise you a bit, let nature guide you and what-not. We could just as easily come across a meditation stop as a hot spring to bathe in, or a masseuse's hut. It's part of the experience. But, I happen to know that the hot springs have a high concentration of ambient light energy... and I can sense it.\"Around the next bend would come what appeared to be the entrance to a cave...<Exit to Laeneth Hot Springs>", "1512802364000": "Jun, for her part, was excited to hop in. So as was quickly becoming her style, she let loose a bolt of lightning around herself, facilitating her change in attire to something far more comfortable for the water. She was now in a claret red swimsuit, a cross-strapped top accompanied by a thin, pleated skirt bottom. Her train of zeal continued as she irreverently jumped into the water.As she popped back up to the surface, she gleefully exclaimed, \"It's alive!\"As she said this, strange, glowing, lily-like plants floated out from the rocky crevices lining the waters to greet her. Jun extended a hand out to gently tap one of them. The flower started glowing green. A few of the other flowers started to glow red and white. The strange lilies orbited Jun, forming a little solar system. Their light would refract through the warm mist of the hot spring, creating colorful clouds which coalesced into a transparent, eerie rainbow.\"I'm... I'm not sure how to explain it without going into a half hour lecture on my understanding of magic, but basically the energy here has a sort of sapience to it. By our standards, it makes a conscious decision to want to soothe and help others. This entire cave system, and the others like it, they're like a... a friendly... spirit? No. Organism? Ecosystem? Uh... eh...\" Jun ultimately chose to shrug and walk her way over to a corner of the hot spring.Naoki and Kate would notice that some of the flowers broke off from Jun's orbit and approached the edge of the water closest to them, as if saying hello.", "1514166701000": "\"Honestly, it's best not to question it, Kate.\" Jun lies back against the rock and allows herself to become lost in the warmth. \"Although, I wouldn't want to suppress your botanical curiosity. I don't think the lilies would wanna do that either.\"As Naoki explored the waters, the lilies closest to her, including the one she approaches, glow magenta. But their color doesn't remain fixed. It shifts from red, to blue, to magenta, until a bunch of them seem to make up their mind, although none of them are of the same mind. All the lilies choose their own color, but run the gamut from red to blue. The lily directly in front of her settles on magenta, however.Naoki would get the impression that the flowers are somehow trying to synchronize themselves with some aspect of her.Once they are done, they begin to orbit her in much the same way as Jun and Kate.As for the precise source of the humming, it would seem to come from the stones themselves at the bottom of the springs. As the lilies did their thing, the humming would mellow out and become more musical.In any case, stress would be the last thing all three of them would feel at the moment.", "1515311712000": "Jun finds herself a similar underwater ledge and takes on a relaxed posture like the others.\"From what I understand... you can't get overheated here... And no one ever drowns... so... take your...\"There was an awkward silence before a slight snoring could be heard coming from Jun, perhaps a painful reminder that she had not slept well the night before.The circling flowers seemed like sentinels now, guarding her safety.The others would of course be perfectly soothed for as long as they wished. As an added bonus, If any of them had any injuries or minor illnesses they were concealing, the mist of the water would seem to slowly ebb them away.", "1515725798000": "Jun goes from being immersed in sheep to starting and flailing about, until she is completely awake and groaning softly. Her head sways weakly and she grips her abdomen.\"M- mermon? Where?\" She looks around anxiously. \"Why? How? What? Whhaaaat? W- what the heck is a mermon?\"The flailing chased away the illuminating lilies, but as Jun made her inquiry they began to return. Interestingly, the color scheme changes from a mellow green, mixed with white and red, to a more alert golden and pink. The light is once again refracted through the spring's silky mist. Lucky for Kate this obscures what would likely be an incriminating trail of ripples coming from her body.\"Hey! Mermon! Buddy! Where are you?\" She keeps looking around. Maybe her common sense wasn't fully awake yet.", "1515824909000": "Jun went from being genuinely anxious to rolling her eyes. \"Ugh...\" She got the joke.And yet she was still compelled to play make-believe. So she reached out her arms, kicked off, and swam over to Kate Green's little solar system at a leisurely pace. \"Waaait, mermon, come back, I wanna be your frieeeeend.\" She spoke with a weak but playful tone. As she approached, she dived under the water. A few seconds later a feathery hand patted Kate's hand and shoved her along. Another hand did the same thing with her shoulder, and then her calf, again and again.Jun was gently (but with increasing speed) spinning Kate's floating body like a pinwheel.", "1516398523000": "\"Very well my mermon friend, I shall beat you at your own nefarious game!\"Jun quickly extended her body out and flapped around until she was stable. Then she gently paddled so she'd spin in one direction, and started to rotate like Kate.The colorful floating lilies followed their movements, and as they rotated simultaneously, the flowers would alternate between them. As they did so, their colors resonated with their individual natures and emotions so that as they gently shifted colors as they moved between the two. Eventually, they settled into a path that looked like an infinity symbol from above.", "1475799239000": "Standing about fifteen meters apart, Jun and\u00a0Alden Marshal  were preparing to test the arena on behalf of Fi Jonorin. It was also a good chance for them to see what they are made of.Jun is in her dragon armor, but otherwise has no magic equipment. She is using a regular steel shortsword. Her steel buckler had the etherobe removed. She has a regular lightweight helm.Meanwhile Alden is wielding leather armor with a camo print, two unenchanted short swords, and a brace of throwing knives.Blackbean was sitting in the stands along with a few random Land-Tillers and some other Sun Marshalls. He was pecking at a few stray bits of popcorn.\"Let's have a fun battle, ok High Marshall?\" She says while also examining their arena. Lots of trees and dirt. Neat.", "1475801437000": "As soon as Jun hears the signal, her left knee bends low and forward and she enters a defensive posture. Her buckler is held forward in her left and her blade close to it in her right. Her back leg slides back and those muscles tense. Her middle would be lower than what Alden would expect in the brief half second she had to react. She did this expecting a ranged knife attack or a rapid sprint. This turtle-like position dissuaded most forms of frontal attack, from sweeps to sword strikes. Alden's sword strike trajectory would place his attack towards her left elbow, easily deflected with a forceful jut of her buckler. His left attack would most likely collide with her sword, as would a possible segue into a kick.And from the moment her knees even started to bend Jun wore an exhilarated smirk as she rapidly uttered the words \"Behl Nalk Kun.\" From the very start of the battle a rapid build up of holy energy would begin, palpable by means of sparks of glowing light all around her. She fully expected a heavy collision from a fast melee fighter like Alden and, if he moved within expected parameters, would not dissuade her from completing her spell a half second later. (Charge 1)", "1475810169000": "While Jun may not be able to physically match Alden's speed, she can certainly think fast, which is why she instinctively ducks underneath the line of trajectory of her shield when she doesn't feel the impact of his sword against it. It is a panicked move, and in all likelihood\u00a0the top of Jun's helm would get clipped. But with sheer iron will, nothing was going to stop her from uttering the final work, not even a ear-splitting clang ringing through her head: \"KUN!\"Alden's would likely be blinded by the burst of light energy that pulsed outward from her flesh. The light construct propagated outwards from the surface of her being and nearly instantaneously formed around her body. It was all Jun could visualize, all she could wish to have: a giant light construct suit of armor.More like a golem than a real suit, the being encased Jun's body and followed her movements. What would immediately follow was am instinctive, enraged\u00a0swing of her now drastically oversized, pulsating, crystalline white right arm towards Alden's entire right side of his body, where a very ordinary steel longsword would have been.", "1475862228000": "Jun feels a dazed, throbbing sensation permeate her mind, forcing her to pause and focus in order to maintain her construct. She knows if the construct fails the fight is over, especially at close range. She is unable to concentrate on casting a new spell. With Alden's superhuman speed, she also unable to muster up a proper follow-up attack. While focusing on maintaining the shell she feels a sudden impact on the construct's left thigh. The energy is distributed through most of the structure, but with Alden's enhanced strength and the momentum of her swing already sending her to her left, Jun's construct slips sideways and is forced to kneel. Jun decides the only way she is going to stand a chance is to put as much distance as she can between herself and Alden. But this will take some doing. Her physical body withdraws into a fetal position within the construct, focusing on controlling it with her thoughts. The construct, while kneeling, suddenly shifts its body forward, and its right leg rapidly swing up and over and attempts to \"stomp\" the top of Alden's head. The structure only looks like a humanoid. It doesn't actually have biological joints. This means its limbs are able to move at odd angles.", "1475874765000": "The golem would suddenly lurch forward just as Alden's blade is about to deliver another withering blow. As the leg swung downward, even as it missed Alden, it struck and kicked off against the forest floor. So too did the rest of the construct's limbs so that Jun would now be galloping forward on all fours like some sort of deranged giant deformed beetle. The liver strike would likely hit the creature's abdomen at an angle and bounce off, leaving Alden liable to be struck by a stray limb as the creature attempted to make it deeper into the forest. Meanwhile Jun continued to position herself within the construct. She appeared to still be in the fetal position, with her shield up towards her head, while looking forward for the largest tree she could find.To Alden's credit, stress fractures were beginning to form in and about the construct. It was close to failing.", "1475877926000": "Seconds after the creature starts galloping, it reaches its target. The golem however doesn't attempt to slam into it, or climb up it. Instead one of the golem's large limbs slams into the tree. The rest of the construct's limbs withdraw. This causes the construct to beginning hooking around the tree just as Alden's knife impacts it. When it does, it bounces off the construct's back, and at that moment the construct finally fails.However, because the construct had started to hook around the tree, Jun's momentum carries her forward like a human cannonball. As soon as she feels the impact she scrunches her body together, her hand behind her buckler to her face, her other hand on the other side of her helm, with her sword angled so that the flat of her blade protects most of her neck, and her legs drawn up to her chest. She is traveling forward an a slight angle which, for a brief fraction of a second will put her out of Alden's line of sight thanks to the tree. Even if he manages to hurl a second knife, Jun barely has any flesh exposed to the open air from above.Even before she proceeds to hit the ground and roll like a veritable pill bug, a flash of bright red mana emanates from the core of her body and is rapidly building up. (Charge 1)", "1475879964000": "Jun however, doesn't bother to try to track his movements at all. Instead she does her best to remain in turtle position, bracing herself for anything that didn't instantly kill her. The knife collides with her body. But where does it land?1-2: Shield (no damage), 3-5: limbs (severe limb damage), 6: small gap in defense to torso (instant kill), 7: spine (instant kill) 8-9: upper back (minimal damage), 10-12: lower back (organ damage, extreme pain, charge interruption)kdXVBOeP1-12Jun is struck in her lower back. The enhanced speed from the knife is enough to splinter into her armor and embed itself into her kidney. The sharp pain is enough to prevent Jun from gathering any more mana. Instead the mana she was able to build up bursts out in a radial pulse.The spell was intended to be a fire elemental summoning, similar to what she once used to fight a giant spider attacking Isra. The creature would have posed a more significant challenge to Alden, if only for a few seconds. Instead it is merely a blast of scalding hot air which blows out in all directions. Still, the briefly charged spell is enough to ignite most of the tree limbs in a several dozen meter radius, hopefully forcing Alden to retreat, even for half a second.Still not one to give up, the now badly injured Jun quickly pulls out the knife, blood loss be damned, and slam her back against another tree, grimacing. She starts to focus her hearing, trying to spot any shuffling of leaves or creaking of branches where she can direct her shield and sword. If she can survive just one more second she can begin casting another spell.1-12", "1475882327000": "Luckily Jun is a fast learner. She realizes immediately that any sort of counterattack against Alden is utterly hopeless.The second she hears Alden's body hit the ground with a thud, she lunges her shield in that direction and crouches down, minimizing her cross-section. Her shield is primed to withdraw protect her front and top. Her sword hand's wrist is at an angle so that the blade decreases the probability of him striking her legs. And she is primed to roll her back to the tree as soon as her senses detect a flank to her side. She will attempt to anticipate his attacks using her senses rather than try to react to what she sees.Despite the dull burning in her lower back, Jun's eyes glow defiantly with more mana. (Charge 1)", "1475883733000": "As Jun's face was mostly hidden by her buckler, the knife collided harmlessly with the shield, although it did make her recoil a bit.As Alden makes his flying leap over Jun's body, he would notice a foreboding sight. Another, much simpler light construct than the golem, was materializing just in front of Alden's trajectory. The construct was in the form of a sharp blade. It would appear to an extent that Jun had been able to figure out her blind spot just before Alden made it there.Unfortunately, Alden's superhuman slash would slam her helm against the tree a fraction of a second before the spell was ready. In that instant a loud clang would be heard, and Alden would go flying through a relatively harmless, actually rather pretty, shower of light sparkles, as the blade dematerialized. When Alden landed, he might turn to see Jun slump to the ground, knocked unconscious by the devastating impact against the tree. The fight was over. Alden was the winner.The sparkles would persist mischievously around Alden's body before fading away into the air.", "1474310756000": "Dressed in a black Isranian women's suit that made her feel more secretive than usual, Jun made her way to the receptionist's desk. On her person was a case filled with some documents she had been working on in her spare time. At first it was just something for fun, something to occupy her restless brain when she was sick of fighting giant monsters or reading about spellcraft. But in light of the recent attacks on her homeland (undead giant dragons, myst behemoths, dark dinosaurs), her idle brainstorms suddenly seemed more relevant.Of course something like this would require the approval of Lord Tristian. But there was a certain someone she wanted to consult first, to see if her idea was even feasible. To her knowledge it had never been done before. And she needed a true expert, a master mage whose knowledge exceeded even those in the Guardian Tower.Grandma \"Hi.\" She said to the receptionist.\"Ah, Jun. You're Lady Naoki's friend. How can I help you today?\"\"I want to speak with... Her.\"\"Who?\"\"You know, \u00a0that person.\"\"I'm sorry I quite literally have no idea what you are talking about.\"\"You know... The creepy old her. How many mysterious entities that people are afraid to mention by name do you know of?\"\"Ma'am, have you forgotten who we are? You'd be surprised.\"\"... Fair point. I'd like to speak with Grandma.\"\"Oh! That creepy mysterious entity people are afraid to mention the name of. Well... I'm not sure she is around but I'll do my best.\"", "1474313650000": "It just so happened that Jun wasn't a very imposing figure either. In fact they were about the same height. \"I'm sure most of what you've heard is wildly exaggerated.\" She reached out to gingerly shake her hand.Chills went up her spine. She hadn't met a magical entity with as intimidating an aura since her own grandmother. \"Uh, well, I'd love to get you know to, I mean get to know you better, if you have the spare time of course. But for right now I'd like to speak in private. Do you know a private place we can talk?\"Jun said every word with the politeness of a princess. There was a single drop of sweat crawling down her left temple.", "1474323507000": "Jun was pleasantly surprised at how well-mannered Grandma was. She couldn't quite tell if it was an act, or if being able to swallow a dragon with a flick of a wrist helps make one kind-hearted. Often times bad tempers belie a fearful soul. As far as Jun knew,  Grandma feared no one.Somewhat more at ease, Jun carefully pulled out her case and removed its contents, a series of pages filled with drawings. Grandma might recognize them as glyph diagrams. However there was no magic to them. They were just notes.As she did this, she spoke calmly. \"Well, I wanted to ask your advice, and maybe your assistance, in designing something to protect the Expanse. Recently our alliance with Isra and the Black Tower became formalized, but the truth is most of the natives are starting to feel ill at ease. There have been so many attacks lately of creatures beyond our reckoning. A chaos mage won't appear again for at least a few hundred years.\"Jun sighed. \"Not everyone shares my cosmopolitan view of the world. And so you understand why we might not want the Black Tower to say, construct another Kami to loom over the Expanse. We appreciate learning from other cultures but we don't want to be at their mercy. We want our dignity. And so I was thinking, what can we design that would help us defend ourselves, but be uniquely ours? Or at the very least something that feels like a true joint project.\"Grandma might notice some of the diagrams had question marks on them. Jun blushed. \"Yah it's a pretty rough design. Still lots of holes. Here.\"She pointed to a map of the Expanse. \"Our two most powerful defenses are the Guardian Wizard Tower and the Temple of Mercy. They are home to our most powerful mages. I don't know too much about the priest who guards the temple but I believe her powers are comparable to Lum'Valia. You might know her. She's a holy dragon and one of my teachers. Oh and of course the Black Tower here is... Well I know it's tougher than it looks. Can you tell what it is I'm thinking?\"Putting it all together, Jun had designed a hybrid between a scrying system and a long range spell delivery system. The idea was to use floating platforms to direct the firepower of the Phoenix of Mercy and the Guardian Tower, and maybe even the Black Tower, anywhere along the Land-Tiller's border. The spells wouldn't necessarily have to be offensive in nature. The Phoenician Lai Ban could cast a Seraphim Seal of Chastity at the temple and drop it onto a battle zone, causing a magical cessation of all violence. \"What do you think? Can it be done?\"", "1474332721000": "Jun furrowed her brow. \"Mm... I mean there are some powerful artifacts here and there but they are mostly being used by the tower. We could probably have a system of mages specifically trained to power the devices, but that would divert precious manpower during a crisis. And I was hoping this system would help save on manpower. Mm...Jun's head collapsed. \"It's going to be one of those isn't it? Ok. I'm going to do some traveling and see if I can acquire some smaller power sources. If you have any suggestions about where I can start, maybe an ancient kingdom or some lost temples or something. That's how these things usually go.\"Jun grinned when she mentioned Grandma's lack of healing magic. \"Really? You know Lum'Valia taught me a thing or too. If you ever need a tutor...\" Then Jun quickly remembered who she was dealing with. \"I don't mean to be presumptuous or anything! Uh, you know, even the most powerful mages have certain schools they aren't particularly gifted at. Ahahahahaha... Ha... Ha...\"She swallowed. \"Right. Chaos mages. It's a bit of a convoluted story. Actually we only recently figured out the mysterious bits when Van'ei the Earthwarden appeared last year. Basically the Land-Tiller's Expanse has an unusually high concentration of mana, and therefore many skilled mages. Its because Va'nei blessed the land 10,000 years ago. As long as we live in harmony with and respect nature, the land will bless us with its bounty. Every few hundred years the land will choose a particular person to be blessed with abilities far above average. This person helps bring balance and justice to the land and ensures its long-term survival... By any means necessary. Sometimes they are viewed as good, and sometimes their actions are more... Controversial. My grandmother fortunately was on the good side. She died recently, and so we won't get another one for a few hundred years at least. That's just how it goes.\"", "1474337518000": "\"That sounds reasonable. I think I could get Lady Naoki to let me dip into her vast treasury, especially for the sake of providing an entire nation with its very own border defense system. Seems unfair Goraia and Isra should get to have all the fun.\"Jun had never heard of Steelscape before. It sounded interesting. She'd probably start there.\"Riiiight... Well, uh, if you ever undergo a change in nature, let me know.\" She chuckled. She was a bit too frightened to ask for further details even though she was deathly curious.\"Well, supposedly she died of old age when I was 12 but, recent events have convinced me her death may not have been natural. I don't know the specifics but I supposed my grandfather was, shall we say, a bit further down the not-so-good spectrum of things. My grandmother was resurrected via powerful necromancy and turned into a deadly weapon. But my grandfather had a change of heart, and he and my grandmother sacrificed themselves to slay a dragon. Doesn't sound very impressive except the creature was over two miles long. Plus I'm fairly certain they wanted to die.\"There was a flash of light. Jun held with her now an artifact. it was a set of gauntlets attached to a strange harness via chains. The harness was silvery and had a multichromatic gem set in the middle. \"She designed this. It's like a staff, but much more efficient. Funny thing is, my grandmother had a magical learning disability. She used this to overcome it until she could grow out of it. This is a newer model I found in the aftermath of the battle I just told you about. My old one is lost somewhere in Goraia...\" Jun said the last part with melancholy.\"Well, anyways, thank you for taking the time to meet with me. If I can find the artifacts, would you be willing to help me refine this design? I'd also like to get Lord Tristain's support in helping to construct it.\"", "1474403194000": "Jun nodded. \"I appreciate all your help. You're welcome to explore anywhere in the Expanse. Er, not that anyone could stop you but, you, just putting it out there. I'd recommend starting with the Temple. It's got an, interesting story.\"Jun promptly took her designs and walked out of the Black Tower Branch with Grandma. When they went outside, they went their separate ways. Jun released the shrink spell on her crow, allowing it to grow to full size, and flew off with a wave towards the entity known as \"Grandma\".She then inhaled and exhaled forcefully. \"Guess she's actually pretty nice. Almost pissed my damn pants though.\"Blackbean cawed in reply, and they flew off into the horizon.<Exit>", "1474992653000": "As soon as she spoke to someone,  she would be informed that a package had materialized in the structure's landing area and that it was apparently meant for her. Then she would receive the powerful artifacts in a neat Equinox package. If she opened the package she would see it was from Jun, with a little happy face next to her name. A few minutes later Jun would arrive in the teleportation room, sweating somewhat, her hair disheveled. She'd find Grandma sitting down in a visitor room.\"Grandma!\" She instinctly rushed in for a hug, then quickly remembered she was dealing with a being who likely inhabited the nightmares of lovecraftian horrors themselves. Thus she smoothly transitioned her posture to that of a jolly hand shake instead.", "1474999916000": "Jun grimaced. \"Oh dear. Ya, seems like someone else wanted the orbs. As soon as I left Steelscape I was attacked by several mages and orcs. They weren't too tough but I accidentally killed all the orcs. When I checked their belongings I found a weird symbol on them. Something tells me I'm not going to Steelscape for a while.\"She reclined on one of the meeting chairs. \"How about you?  You said you were gonna travel the Expanse. Find anything good?\"", "1475004837000": "When Grandma informed her that she could expect further attacks in the future, she let out a sarcastic \"Woo.\"\"Oh that's cool. I guess that means you'll be staying in the Expanse more often. And yes, I've heard interesting things about the priestess. Her power supposedly rivals the chaos mages'.\"Although she was enjoying her rest, she knew she wanted to get started on her idea. One again she pulled out her schematics. \"So, since we have a few of those power sources to work with, how about this. We create a network of scrying devices across the expanse. These devices can alert the Black Tower,  the Guardian Tower, and the Temple of a major threat. Then we distribute the beads to those three locations, and each of them creates a platform from which they can access the scrying network and find the threat. Then they use the platform to fire their spells into a one directional  portal, which opens up above or near the target. Then bam. Target eliminated. The strongest mages in all the Expanse will be able to project their might anywhere in the Expanse at any time,  including you if you want.\" She grinned devilishly. \"We might even be able to project anti-magic through it.\"", "1475014687000": "Jun blinked. Then she hung her head in shame. She started counting the remaining bank notes she had on her possession.\"I'm sure the Guardian Tower has some, and could stand to make some more, but something tells me we could use a few extra. I was hoping we could do most of the work locally but, looks like we'll need the Black Tower after all to help make up the deficit. Let's go talk to Lord Tristian Seryl . Maybe he can help.\"If there were no objections they use the telepathic network to try to summon him to their branch.", "1475017001000": "Jun sighed. \"Alright...\"After greeting Tristan with a polite smile, she invited them to go back to a meeting room and laid out her schematics on the table. \"Well, right now the people are upset, in light of the myst behemoth attack, the zombie attacks, that weird dinosaur thing on the northern border, you get the idea. They want a defense system kind of like Isra's, but unique, something that they had a hand in creating. I've been messing around with an idea in my spare time, but I've decided with Grandma's help to actually try to get it built.\"One of the pages had a map of the Expanse, with three locations marked. \"The most heavily fortified locations in the Expanse are the Black Tower, the Guardian Tower, and the Temple of the Phoenix. They each have their own potent magic defenses which could have made short work of most of those threats. So I was thinking, what if there was a way to bring their spells to bear anywhere in the Expanse. What me and Grandma are working on is a scrying network set up throughout the expanse, and a portal system that allows magic portals to appear over any hostile target identified by the scrying network. The other end of the portal would open up to a platform built in these three locations. From there a team of powerful mages, including the Elder himself or perhaps even Grandma here, if necessary, can fire their strongest spells through the portal. It would be like having our strongest defenders guarding every inch of the Expanse at the same time. The portal would be one way, so they wouldn't be in danger. And it's a much more energy-efficient system than say, Goraia's weapon.\"She also pointed to the magic orbs that she went through the trouble of obtaining in Steelscape. \"And now we have a power source for the portal system. The reason why I called you, Sir Tristian, is because I still believe we'll need the Black Tower's help in constructing the system. For instance, we'll need more scrying devices. But, it'll be a joint project between the Land-Tillers and the Black Tower, and it'll greatly boost both reputations. Grandma likes the idea. What about you? What do you think?\"", "1475019120000": "Jun nodded. \"Me and Grandma will send you a list as soon as possible. Oh, there is one thing you might be able to help us with right now.\"She grinned with excitement. \"A cool name.\"", "1475020869000": "Jun pondered. Then she rushed over to her notes and started to scribble. When she was done, she proudly held the paper up to Tristain and Grandma.Terror, Triangular, Terra, network, system...\"Triadic Emergency Reconnaissance and Reactive Artillery \"T.E.R.R.A.\"Maybe?\" She said, hopeful.", "1477353314000": "(Sometime after Jun's training in Esdara, but before the war between Isra and Goraia)\"Ok... easy, easy... easy...\" Jun carefully directed the convoy of wheelbarrows into the Druidic Enclave. It was a daily contribution from the rest of the Expanse to support the Guardians of Gaia. The barrels were filled with fruits, vegetables, dried meat, and sea food. The convoy was a little larger than usual because Jun had decided to make a personal offering to Va'nei in exchange for her pending druid lessons.\"You know, you could probably wear whatever you want.\" One of the tillers said to Jun. \"Those robes are way too big for you.\"\"Well, I mean I wanted to look the part. Besides, they're... I mean they breath nicely.\" Jun was wearing brown, oversized druidic robes which were supposed to help her be in more in touch with earth energy. Unfortunately they dragged on the floor. The pointed hat blocked her vision. If only she had known that the hat was completely superfluous and had mostly been given to her as a prank.\"Ok, hope you're not busy saving the world or something...\" Jun muttered to herself as she used the crystal she had been given. A beacon of green light shot out into the sky.", "1477355429000": "And just like that Jun's feigned confidence in her attire came crashing down like so many branches in a furious monsoon. \"I forgot to do laundry today.\" She said red-faced and a little cross. The pointy wizard's hat slipped down and blocked her vision at the very end of her sentence.\"Miss Jun would humbly present you with this offering, as a token of gratitude for all that you have done, and wishes to receive training in the druidic arts.\" The escort had with him a particularly large wheelbarrow containing several pots filled with food. There was an assortment of seasoned cooked grains, such as rice, millet, and bulgur, as well as baskets of fruit and stews made of fish. They were surrounded by wards floating about in the air, obviously designed to help keep things fresh.The attendant looked towards Jun and suppressed a giggle. His lips visibly flattened into a restrained smile.\"Miss Jun also needs a new set of druid robes.\" Jun muttered to herself before responded back with a sarcastic grin. The grin would appear genuine for a split second afterwards as the pointy wizard's hat yet again collapsed forward and concealed the top half of her face.", "1477358529000": "\"What the, what are you- Eeek! Hahaha! What- what are you doing?\" Jun giggled uncontrollably as the vines wrapped around her. She especially squealed when the vines touched her more sensitive areas. When it was all over she was pleased with the results.\"I guess I'm a sexy vegetable for today.\" She chuckled and did a twirl.The attendant bowed and saw to the rest of the offering to the Guardians of Gaia, though he occasionally stole some glances at the sexy vegetable.\"I'm ready to go when you are.\"", "1477363719000": "Jun followed the Earthwarden deeper into the grove. When they arrived, Jun plopped herself onto an adjacent tree trunk. The waxy vines still felt odd against her skin, but she found herself getting used to them quickly enough. \"Druid magic, druid magic... Well, my understanding is that druids use magic to commune with living things. My school of magic works something like this: All magic is based on the life force found in all things on the earth. When we cast spells, we communicate with this life force to get it to bend to our will. I used to think of the life force as a weapon, something to harmonize with to unleash its destructive power. But when I received training from Fundor, I learned that the magic itself is alive. He taught me to absorb heat energy from my surroundings to cast my spells, by trusting the energy from the heat to help me when I was out of mana. I learned that the communication of magic works both ways, if that makes sense.\"Jun thought for a moment. \"So, fundamentally, druid magic is people's way of 'talking' to living organisms, with our magic, and also unleashing the full potential of life. At least that's how I understand it.\"Jun shook her head, a little bemused. \"I hope that wasn't completely wrong.\"", "1477367862000": "\"Right, got it.\"Jun reached down and brought her legs up so that she was sitting in a relaxed, not-quite-lotus position. (Mastery over druid magic wasn't worth her ankles.) She began to relax and breath deeply. Breath by breath, bit by bit, she silenced her thoughts until she could feel all the different magical energies around her.She felt them as clearly as one feels the location of a piece of furniture in a familiar room, when one gets the sensation that they are being watched. It was all around her, swirling around her, waiting for her command.\"I feel... warmth... I feel... fire... fire energy... It feels like it's close by... all around me... And light, I feel like... and darkness... anger... hate... and... coolness... water... and in the floor... there's something in the floor... and even the air... but...\"What Jun was sensing was the magical energies that she was most familiar with, or rather the elements that were most familiar with her. Like guardian spirits, these energies were close to her, enveloping her like music, ready to spring forth if she was in danger. Fire and light were first and foremost because those were the elements she used most often. Fire was the energy that most attracted her when she was little. The others became more familiar with her as she practiced with them, like old friends.But there was a certain energy she wasn't actually very familiar, one that she rarely \"sang\" with. \"There! In the trees! Oh wow...\" She could feel it. Almost as if she had been afflicted with synesthesia, she could sense the energy like it was a smell, a color, and a temperature all at once. \"It's warm, but also cool, and it smells... mossy... green? It smells green? I can definitely feel it but it feels so far away...\"Because she had rarely practiced druidic magic, she could not feel the aura anywhere near her. The other presences were in the way, so to speak.There was a caveat to this. Because of whatever the Earthwarden did to her back in the library, \"unlocking her potential for earth magic\", she did feel as if the energy was watching her, taking notice of her, waiting.\"There's... some of it in me too.\"", "1477376057000": "\"Ok, I'll try.\"Jun did her best to push aside the other presences in favor of the omnipresent life energy.In her headspace she concentrated. Gotta focus. Gotta focus. Gotta focus...She tried to invite the energy to come close to her, tried to force the other energies to recede and invite the life energy to fill in the gap. It was an odd sensation, a bit like inviting a pet to come closer with a series of clicks and whistles. It wasn't easy. In her mind she tried to view it in different ways, with different emotions, through different lenses. Anger and frustration brought forth the fire and darkness. Love and justice brought out fire and light. Fire was all about passion, which overlapped with the other two elements. Air was grace and evasion. Earth was steadfastness and respect. Water was calmness and adaptability. What was the essence of life? Of living things? What did living things respect?She sat there for several minutes. In her mind she was thinking, How do I talk to you? She started thinking about different life forms and what they represented. Some life forms were passionate, some were stubborn, some were flexible, and some were some combination of a thousand different other attributes.She wrinkled her forehead. No, that can't be it. It can't be that complicated. Something else... What do all living things have in common? What do they have in common?Common.\"They are all connected.\" She said this out loud.\"We are all connected. Inter... interconnectivity... everything is connected... not a single song... but a chorus...\"It took several minutes, but eventually Jun had worked out the puzzle. And with that the earth's magic slow but surely began to recognize her and flow into her.", "1477443611000": "Jun remained in her meditative state, but gave a little thumbs up to signify that she had heard her instructions.Jun spent a good amount of time familiarizing herself with the strange life magic. She felt (and smelled) it most prominently among the trees. But the more she concentrated the more she felt it in other places, even the air itself. She continued to meditate on the fact that all life forms were connected and were all sharing this great big ball of mud that was the world. Gradually more and more druidic magic surrounded and infused itself in and around her.The other auras maintained their distance, so to speak, along Jun to familiarize herself with her new \"friend\".", "1477515515000": "Jun nodded and concentrated.She felt the presence of the little life in front of her, like a child, or a book waiting to be read.She would attempt to make the seed grow by directing the druidic energy into the seed. She tried visualizing what the plant might look like and \"watering\" it with her magic. She also tried directing the dirt, soil, and air to \"help\" the seed. In her head space it looked like there was a coordinated dance of activity as the druidic magic acted in and around the tiny thing.", "1477529474000": "Jun breathed a sigh of relief.\"Oh ok. That makes my job easier.\"She put all her concentration into just making the seedling grow, which would presumably make it grow much faster and into an impressive size.Jun would stand up to examine the new life, and then exclaim, \"Eek, legs asleep. Legs asleep!\" Evidently sitting for an hour had done her circulation no favors.", "1478462483000": "(One week later)After a week, Jun returned to the druidic enclave. This time she was alone, but there were two elongated light construct arms trailing behind her. These arms were carrying two wheel barrows. One had an assortment of potted plants, and the other several pots of food. The potted plants came in various shapes and sizes, mostly flowers, which Jun had been experimenting with. Some of them were much larger than others.As for the food, most of it was the usual fare. However there were a couple of pots of edible insects, mostly fried bamboo worms and meal worms. There was also a bag containing rock tripe, a relatively new addition to the Land-Tiller's diet. These lichens were being adapted to grow up in the mountains and had a bitter, medicinal flavor only some people seemed to like. Jun was curious what Va'nei would think of these dishes.Once again she used her green crystal to summon the mighty Earthwarden to her position.She wore the same leaf-like dress from before. Somehow Jun had managed to keep it alive with what little druidic magic she held sway over. However, the dress was noticeably yellower and even had dried brown bits scattered around it.", "1478473759000": "Jun smirked. \"Show-off.\" She said under her breath. A part of her couldn't help but be competitive even against the mighty Earthwarden.\"It's good to see you too!\" She said more blatantly and sincerely. \"I've been practicing like you said, and I wanted to bring you some samples of my work.\" She reached out with one of her hands and brought one of the light constructs forward. The stretchy hand contracted and brought forth the cart with the pots of plants. \"I was practicing with different kinds of seeds. Some of these plants normally take years to grow, but I managed to get them to grow in just a few hours. And some of these grew almost instantly.\" She gestured proudly at some specific plants in her collection. \"Oh, here.\" Jun pulled out a small seed and planted it in front of Va'nei. \"I used to only be able to do this with pre-treated seeds, but this is just a regular seed.\" She held her hand out over the little mound of earth she made. In seconds a small seedling appeared, which after about 30 seconds grew into a little fern-like plant.She grinned proudly.\"Oh, I brought you some more food. Do you eat insects?\" She walked over to one of the barrels and held out a fried worm before plopping it in her mouth. \"They taste better than the lichens that your guardians have been researching. But actually my dad likes them and wants to grow them on our walls.\" She said this with a bemused smirk as she held up the odd, greyish, rubbery mass. The lichen gave off a not entirely unpleasant odor, a bit like tea. She spun it on one finger like pizza dough before placing it back into the container.", "1478558816000": "\"I'd like that.\" She said in response to her invitation to the valley. She followed Va'nei to the secluded spot.When asked about druidic magic, Jun nodded affirmatively. \"Much easier. I feel like the magic is willing to work with me more, if that makes sense. Although it's still kind of difficult to keep the other magical energies out. The other day I was in a foul mood and I tried to make a bush grow. I ended up setting it on fire. Poor thing.\"Jun's hidden aura was indeed almost rainbow-like.", "1478733671000": "\"I see. Ow. This reminds me of -ow- when Lum'Valia was teaching me- ow- to make light constructs and healing magic.\" After being repeatedly headbutted by the young goat, Jun playfully batted her hands at the kid and then reached out and gently bopped it on the head with her palm.Jun closed her eyes and took a deep breath; she needed to block out any distractions and focus on reaching out to the druidic magic around her. She tried to copy Va'nei's feat. She extended her hands and focused on the patch of dirt before her.Perhaps to Va'nei's surprise, a small, seedling like structure began to appear from the earth! The seedling erupted into a vine. But it wasn't a normal looking vine. It was troublesome, with brown roots and odd glowing patches all around it in various colors. The abomination was able to grow a few meters before suddenly bursting into flames and disappearing in a cloud of ash. Oddly enough it left behind a pool of water as well.\"Eeek!\" Jun batted the smoke away from her hands as the poor vine immolated itself. She stared disappointed at the remains of her \"plant\".\"Vokrii?\" Jun cast a light spell on it in an attempt to repair the structure. The ash came together and formed into a vine... made of ash. Jun poked it with her finger. The vine disintegrated yet again, though with fewer special effects this time.Jun looked up at Va'nei and grinned shyly.", "1478936809000": "Jun pouted and pointed to no particular spot around her. \"Bad fire energy. Don't set fire to my plants.\" She sort of just stared at the air with an amused grin and then turned to Va'nei. \"Honestly it's like trying to force children to get along.\"It would be hard to tell just how serious she was being. But most likely she was just playing around.Jun started meditating to build up druidic magic, and tried again. She waved her hands forwards and tried to create new life. But this time she had no success at all. Life simply refused to find a way. Jun opened her eyes and glared at the ground, frustrated. Her hands remained where they were and Jun strained. Her hands began giving off sparks of energy and there was a rushing, whining sound around her as more mana swirled around her.Suddenly a massive root erupted from the ground. It spit chunks of earth everywhere as it writhed about like a decapitated octopus tentacle. But like last time the vine was infected with different types of magical energy. Great boils of concentrated magic appeared around the vine's flesh. By the time the vine had reached 15 meters tall and had grown as thick as a tree trunk, it looked more like a failed attempt at a candy cane made by a blind child than a living plant. The boils exploded, releasing clumps of dirt, mud, snow, and water. Fortunately there was no fiery blast. The large \"plant\" would surely have injured both of them.Jun stood up and folded her arms, examining the \"plant\" with intellectual curiosity. Her head bobbed up and down. She stood on tip toe then knelt down, then stood back up, all the while humming \"mhm\" noises. She then peeked her head around the plant to speak to Va'nei. \"We're gonna be here a while.\" She said confidently.A boil exploded, covering Jun's face in mud just as she finished speaking. If Va'nei's ears were sharp enough she'd hear teeth grinding sounds coming from Jun's otherwise stoic face.", "1479673052000": "Jun gave a thin-lipped smile as the mud slid off her face. She waited until she was completely clean and listened carefully to Va'nei's words.\"It's not easy to separate the magics. I think it's because of how conceptualize druidic magic. It's the essence of life, interconnectivity. In a sense life is where all the other elements get their power. So there's this weird sort of natural bond between them, at least for me. It's like every element is a spirit that wants to be a part of life, fire, water, light, darkness, lightning, earth... This principle I feel is what allows me to wield druidic magic so quickly, but also makes it hard to focus it by itself.\"Jun decided to try again, just for fun. She tried to command a flower to grow out of nowhere. After a few seconds a brilliant red bloom blossomed out of the earth. Jun was stunned by its beauty, It had large waxy petals and golden highlights spread throughout the blossom like veins. She gave a satisfied chuckle... until the bloom suddenly began steaming and burst into flames. The once glorious plant withered into a little grey stalk and then disappeared.\"I'll seek out a magical nexus and come back later.\" Jun saluted. She stared at the spot where the flower had appeared, her mind suddenly struck by ideas and possibilities.", "1480090627000": "(A couple of weeks later)Jun had returned to the enclave, once again with some wheelbarrows worth of gifts and trial samples. This time she brought a large serving of an odd sweet bread, thick and brown and juicy, saturated with a molasses-like substance. It would be comparable to french toast only orders of magnitude sweeter.But more importantly were the flowers.After weeks of meditating and experimentation, Jun was becoming more and more successful at creating life that wasn't infected with other types of magic, and she was eager to share her solution with Va'nei. But in addition to that, she had actually figured out a way to put the infectious tendencies of her other magics to good use. Va'nei would see a cart of flowers of various colors, all glowing slightly and giving off a very slight hum. There were various colors represented, particularly red, white, and a deep purplish black.", "1480183031000": "It had been a while since Jun had seen the great dragon in her true form. She hadn't felt this dwarfed since training with Fundor deep within the volcanic chamber. But this time she was staring into those gigantic works of art that were a dragon's eyes,surrounded by trees, cool air, and fresh soil, with friends and family within walking distance. It was a much more pleasant experience.\"I guess you're referring to this?\"Jun gave a little curtsy, accentuating the leaves of her skirt. Despite the two weeks elapsed time her living druidic outfit held up much better. There was only a little yellowing at the edges of the leaves, where as last time the outfit was half dead after a single week.\"Yah, my druidic magic has gotten stronger. Look.\" Jun raised her hands up and wiggled her fingers playfully. Then she focused. Va'nei would notice a much more controlled, coordinated flow of druidic energy from both her finger tips and the ambient environment. It started small, very small, and a correspondingly small seed formed out of nowhere within the earth. Afterwards the magical flow increased exponentially, resulting in the seed growing.\"You see what I was doing wrong before? I was trying to do it all at once. It's easier to manipulate a small living organism into a large one, as opposed to creating a large one out of thin air, so I realized I was better off creating a small organism to work with. That way I can still make whatever I want.\" Indeed, as she spoke the little seedling rapidly expanded into a large, healthy, tree-trunk like vine.\"This next part is even cooler. Watch.\" As the vine continued to grow, Va'nei would notice odd, marble-like fruiting bodies growing out of offshoots along the vine. They came in various colors ranging from a deep mahogany, swirling red, to a translucent grey with white glowing spots within its flesh. \"You see, it's still hard for me to keep the other magical energies from infecting my creations, but with some concentration and practice, I can instruct the magic to coalesce in a way that doesn't hurt the plant. The vine is just fine, and the extra magic is kept safe in those fruiting bodies. Also, look!\"Jun waved her hands apart. The large vine stopping growing. She then raised one hand forward and thrust her palm up. The fruiting bodies popped off the vine and began to dance around Jun. Jun then turned to her side and face her palm towards the air. One of the dancing orbs, a red one, flew to her palm and then popped. A powerful, but concentrated burst of flame careened out of her palm and towards the ground. There was a flash, and a small crater was left behind. Jun then took her other palm and summoned a blue orb to it. Then that orb popped, releasing writhing ribbons of water which floated about until they struck the ground. \"One more thing.\" Jun closed her eyes and focused. She focused very, very hard. The greyish orb and a dark violet orb floated towards each of her palms. Va'nei would sense Jun straining quite a bit, almost alarmingly so.\"Twilight... dancers...\" The orbs pulsed and then burst. Jun now held a white flame and a black flame, one in each hand. The two flames seemed to struggle to grow larger, as if trying to form into something big and powerful. There was a swirling of mana around her and a wooshing, jet-engine like sound-And then it stopped. The flames unceremoniously went out, and Jun collapsed on her knees. Gasping she said, \"Ugh, nevermind.\" She looked disappointed. \"Still can't do it.\"", "1480261029000": "Jun flopped over and looked up at the motherly dragon. \"You know, your breath is a lot more pleasant than Fundor's.\" Then she stared up at the Conclave's canopy.\"You're right. I just got excited is all. That spell I was trying to cast is impossible anyways. I've only known of 3 people who could do it. One was my grandmother, the other is the high priestess of that temple down Mau River, and the third is possibly Grandma of the Black Tower. None of them are normal humans by the way. I don't even think Commander Viddik of Gauldin can do it. And I've seen him freeze an ocean before.\"The vine from before began growing again. It extended its tendrils and picked Jun up while morphing into a leafy approximation of a lounge chair. \"I'll be fine in a few minutes. So what's the next lesson?\"", "1480433799000": "Jun saluted and laid back in the lounge chair. She took a deep breath and relaxed. Or at least, she tried to. She was still somewhat upset. She knew casting that spell would be all but impossible. So why did she think she could do it? She tried to reassure herself that her idea was clever, to use a flaw in her druidic spellcasting to her advantage. But in the end wielding light and dark energies simultaneously is something reserved for beings of a legendary sort. And Jun had outgrown her desire to be a legend.Right?After several minutes Jun found her body was renewed in strength. She walked over to the wheelbarrow and took a small fragment of what was left of that sweet bread. She took a large bite.With a slightly muffled voice she said, \"Ok, I'm ready to go.\"", "1540962449000": "----------Mau River was lined by cool, rocky bluffs filled with vegetation. Carved into their sides were massive footholds, large enough for a group of people to sit atop of and have a picnic while watching the lazy waters below. The skies above were veiled with thin sheets of clouds. The sun was peeking into the valley, but Jun and Vaelar Black  were already dressed and having their breakfast on a large hemp mat. Jun had simply announced to Vaelar\u00a0that she didn't want to be alone. And from there they arrived here, together, overlooking those same lazy waters.Red bean cakes, fruits, and some fresh pemmican-like meat preserved in fat and berries glutted the woven basket. There were clay jugs of water and wine sitting next to them.Jun had stopped working on the dozens of pages of notes that were scattered on half the mat. Now she was lying against Vaelar's body, her thoughts lost among those veils of clouds. She occasionally brought her eyes eye-level to Blackbean, who was apparently failing to make friends with some of the other more mundane, local fowl circling the air above the water. The other crows and ravens just seemed to know he wasn't quite their kin. It didn't help that he was hundreds of times bigger than any of them.\"Vaelar\u00a0I'm sorry.\" She finally said. \"We shouldn't be hanging out like this, you pretending to be on a date with me while I'm trying to figure out how to kill an ancient perverse horror. We should be relaxing, shopping in Isra, having wild unyielding sex inside of a psionic bubble underneath the oceans while dolphins watch us with envy. Instead, you've mostly been watching me do homework the last few days.\"She held his hand tightly.", "1540966359000": "Jun leaned into the forehead kiss, her face twinged slightly with a bemused grin. She chuckled. She empathized.\"I dunnno. If I had to pick someone possessing such unbridled libido worthy of the title 'supernatural', it'd probably be yours.\"She leaned forward a bit and looked down at the strange creature showing off its might in the water. The local fish had evolved ways of staving off many of the local predators, interlocked in a precarious arms race against fishing eagles and small wyverns. But it was unlikely any of them were prepared for a mighty manticore's jaws. And so he would likely find his success rate rather high, and his belly quickly full.\"But, I really do appreciate you coming here. Thank you.\"Jun had at least made an effort to wear something delicate. She was adorned in a long, grey, sleeveless sundress, trimmed and decorated with white floral patterns and symbols from her tribe. Her bare arms revealed various small scars that Black had probably seen many, many times before. Jun typically preferred pants or some sort of leg coverings. But in this case she too left her ankles and feet bare. They were dotted with small scars as well.Blackbean sailed down towards the waters to get in on the fishing action.Jun sat up a bit, her spirits lifting when she saw Blackbean head towards Boscoe. She had been waiting to see if they'd be able to get along. She reached up to put an arm around Vaelar and then pointed down, at least a little excited.\"Tell me the story of how you two met again? I love stories of animal companions.\" Her eyes met his, and Vaelar\u00a0would perceive in her glittering gaze a child-like need for something sweet and innocent.", "1541399704000": "Blackbean caws playfully, a half-apology, half-chuckle for frightening the manticore.He cocks his head curiously at the fish, then starts poking at it. His thick black beak, impervious to the spines, prods and turns the armed treat until he finds a weak spot in the lower belly. He stabs it, then spreads his beak apart, splitting the skin right up to the mouth. He then starts eating the innards, bones and all.Meanwhile, Jun hangs on each of Vaelar's words. Her eyes have brightened, and she grins with pride. Vaelar\u00a0could go toe to toe with any fairy tale knight in shining armor.What impressed her most of all, however, was the act of mercy towards the manticore. It was both a kind thing to do, and very clever in the end. These were traits she valued in Vaelar, enough to overlook his often overly-affected chivalrous speech.When he had finished and was smiling down on her, she gave a single chuckle and looked down towards the manticore, who was apparently trying to befriend Blackbean with some kind of spiny fish offering (either that or toss him a scrap he didn't know how to deal with himself).\"You should take note. It's stories that mix valor and compassion that make a man that much more attractive.\" With that, she blushed slightly.\"Huh, I guess I never shared that with you, huh?\" She glanced up thoughtfully and leaned back. \"It feels like such a long time ago. It almost doesn't feel like me who did it.\"***She sighed. \"My grandmother didn't believe in withholding magical knowledge from me. She wanted me to learn all kinds of magic, so that I could decide for myself what I would keep and what I would discard. In retrospect, it was probably wrong of her. I was so ambitious and power-hungry that I dove headlong into all types, even... the less savory ones.\" She held up a clarifying finger at Vaelar. \"The one thing I would never, ever touch is necromancy. Our people hate necromancy. It's a long story. But my grandmother was a combat pragmatist. So she wasn't afraid to call upon the next best thing: blood magic. She could use her own blood to summon demons, and if necessary even enter the demon realm. She was able to sign contracts with certain demons, whose only price was the inflicting of suffering on her. It wasn't something she relished using, but she did so to great effect. Hmm, she could also use her blood as a sort of magical ignition source, like a mana potion and a weapon rolled into one. It's all very complicated and nasty, and a little off topic.\"She cleared her throat uncomfortably. \"The point is, I could do it too. And quite frankly I was good at it.\"After a pause, she continued. \"There were four demons in particular that I had befriended. One was a sort of skeletal horror with many faces named Dantalion. As far as evil goes... he wasn't actually that bad. He was understanding of the nature of good and evil, and of people in general. He knew me very well, and when I finally gave up demon magic, he was the first to tell me there were no hard feelings between us. The other three were demon crows. Blackbean was one, and there were two others, Cinnamon and Blueberry.\"She grinned, embarrassed. \"I must have been hungry when I named them... Anyways, demon crows are very intelligent. They're not particularly evil either. In fact, I'd call them more... morally neutral. They feed off of the scraps of other demons in hell. They consume blood, diseased flesh, all sorts of nasty things you find there. Sometimes they hunt. All they ask for from a summoner, mostly, is good quality food from the mortal realm. Dantalion was the one who helped me find them and make contracts with them. He's sort of a demonic mentor by the way. He archives people's stories and knowledge. He's an asshole to most people, but he respects the audacity of those who would dare practice blood magic. I kind of miss him sometimes, but he knows where we stand. The path I'm following now has no room for the kind of... self, that blood magic requires. It's a very visceral, burning, dark energy you have to have. And frankly, it's not very healthy.\"She sighed exasperatedly and looked up to Vaelar. \"Sorry, I keep getting off topic. This is all really personal, you understand. Lots of baggage in this tale. Anyways, specifically, I found them in a realm of hell called the Black Char Forest. It's a... very red place. The lighting, the black sun, the heat, the only trees that grow there are bare black trees. There are lots of nasty little critters there too. Huh, not the most creative name for a region now that I think about it. Anyways, the demon crows like to scavenge there. I don't remember which demon lord rules that place. I think it's more on the outskirts of hell. Anyways, the demon crows are relatively friendly, and are good starter demons if you ever get into that sort of thing... which I really really really don't recommend you do.\" Jun blinked repeatedly. \"Uh, but anyways, those three were part of a family. Blackbean's a pretty big guy, even for a demon crow. But he's sort of a gentle giant. The others are more vicious. They used to steal food from him. He was a good hunter though, so he didn't starve.\"Jun peered down again at Blackbean and Boscoe. She beamed. \"He has very little malice within him. For this reason, he's actually rather resistant to holy energy and light magic. Some demon crows are like that. If for some reason they're able to find a source of holy energy, they'll bathe in it to remove demon ticks. It's actually pretty funny. They'll flap around in it and these awful bugs will just start smoldering and smoking and fall to the ground. It feels like a hot bath to them.\"Sorry, I'm rambling again. Long story short, Dantalion set up the contract, I signed it in blood, and we were set. From then on I could just summon them from the demon realm. I figured out a way to cheat a little. I could withdraw blood with a syringe and place it into a vial, then use the vial to cast the spell. It's much more convenient than slashing a palm on the fly. Of course, I can't do it anymore. Oh! The reason why Blackbean is still here is because, after I became a holy mage, I met up with a demon friend of mine named Maelik. I told him I wanted to say good-bye to the demon friends I had before. He opened a portal to the demon realm and helped me get back in contact with the demons one last time. And let me tell you, every single one of them except for Dantalion and Blackbean, thought I was a bitch and a traitor. All my old contracts were destroyed, except for Blackbean's.\"Jun paused, hesitating, as this next part Vaelar might find disturbing. \"There is a small black stone, hidden somewhere, that contains a small portion of my soul. It's what binds Blackbean to the mortal realm. If it's destroyed, nothing will happen to me. But Blackbean will be forced to return to hell, and I'll never be able to see him again without the help of another demon lord. Maelik was an exceptionally kind demon. It was a miracle that I ran into him. I doubt I'd be able to meet another one who would help a holy mage reunite with a demon friend.\"She looked at Vaelar with earnest. \"Blackbean doesn't like hell. He prefers to stay here, with me. Honestly, he's the only vestige of my old self that I truly don't regret... So yah, that's the story.\"She took a deep breath. \"That felt good actually.\"", "1546200894000": "Jun's head relaxed on top of Vaelar's shoulder.\"It's... oddly comforting being called little. With so much riding on what's happening, it's nice not have to be big. I want you to be the biggest thing in me- AROUND, UNDER, NEXT TO... fuck. You know what I mean.\"Jun sighed, and Vaelar would feel her relatively little body relax into him, like a long rope going slack for the first time in months.\"Stay alive.\" She said softly. \"No matter what happens. We'll conquer the Wyld together.\"Blackbean and Boscoe had amassed a fortune of fish. Their unprecedented synchrony would have Land-Tiller zoologists baffled for ages to come. They feasted together happily, having finally found mates of comparable size who understood what it was like to flout biological conventions established by the Square/Cube Law. Hoping to distract herself from yet another awkward slip of the tongue, Jun craned over Vaelar's other shoulder to observe them below.\"It's so cool we both have such epic mounts, isn't it? ... I'll bet mine's faster though.\" Jun smirked mischievously.", "1547183888000": "Vaelar's rock-hard chest was as good a desk as any for Jun to slam her forehead into as he repeated her slip of the tongue to her.Vaelar's confidence elicited a little smirk. But it was somewhat hidden from Black's view as she looked off to the side. Her eyes more so, they scaled the opposing cliffside as Jun contemplated vanquishing the beast on the horizon.A little bit of discomfort and fear prickled up her spine as she realized that Vaelar had no idea what he was talking about. She had a flashback to that fateful day. On one end was Daedalus, one of the most powerful mages she had ever met besides her own grandmother, capable of casting spells she could only dream of (for now). On the other end was herself, recently returned from an apprenticeship with what was essentially a nature god. Both of them used magic which quite literally shook the earth with their fury. They literally set the horizon on fire. And this deific trespasser or whatever it was, laughed at them.It was frustrating. It was painful. Jun had accepted that she didn't need to surpass her grandmother, that she was her own person with her soul, her own dreams, her own ambitions. But at the very least, she wanted to be able to protect her people from harm. But this stupid, godforsaken world just kept raising the fucking bar. How much stronger did she have to get? Was calling upon the power of an entire forest to drench the enemy in exploding ghost animals not good enough?But like Vaelar, she didn't let those insecurities register on her face. It was healthy and right to be honest about her feelings, but only in a trickle, enough for Vaelar to deal with. He had almost died himself, and he didn't deserve to be treated like a mop for her tears. The flood dam would have to be held back. Yes, only a trickle would get through.She gripped his shoulder and closed her eyes.\"Yah, we will.\" She said resolutely.As the topic shifted to the speed of their mounts, Jun's spirit sat straight up. \"Is that so?\" The mood completely shifted. Her teeth were bared devilishly. \"You think your overused castle motif can keep up with my best friend? Psh. Dragons are overrated. I'll have you know when my grandmother fought dragons in the Darastrix War, she was riding on the back of her very own demon crow... I think its name was Nutmeg... Now that I think about it we both had a habit of naming demons after food.\" She shook her head. \"Anyways, Lady Naoki pays my salary so I'm happy to accept.\"Jun propped herself up on her forearms. Her elbows dug into his chest. She then slid her thigh up his and gently but firmly pressed her knee into his loins. \"And I can't wait to put you in handcuffs.\"", "1515308943000": "Alright, here goes nothing.An upbeat, relatively small-framed young brunettte side-step galloped onto the battlefield. She wanted to convey her enthusiasm to the crowd, and she waved gleefully with one hand at all the spectators on one end. Then she quickly turned around and waved at the others.Big smile. Biiiig smile.She was wearing an emerald, thigh-length gambeson of a thick cloth, clearly designed to take some damage. On top was a lamellar brigandine, pauldron, gauntlets, and tassets, all of verdant hue. Her not-waving cheerfully hand held a barbuta helmet that appeared to be made of  shimmering brass-like material with a white pattern-weld.On a strap around her waist hung a glimmering brass-like shield with an sapphire orb inset in the middle. Holstered was what appeared to  be a sky blue shortsword.\u00a0Jun brushed some hair out of her eyes and started strapping on her helmet, which had a coif already tied inside. This took only a few seconds. When she was done she gave the crowd a thumbs up. (A little birdie told her that the crowd might want to get a\u00a0 good look at her olive face first.)She then looked around excitedly to see her opponent. After all, at least eighty percent of the enthusiasm she demonstrated was genuine.", "1515548007000": "Jun smirked when she sees Daedalus up close. Heh, good-looking guy. A twinge of insecurity shot through her throat when she saw that he isn't armored, and she wondered for a second if she overprepared for the match. In that regard, his dazzling smile was a relief, even more so after he got through bathing himself in his golden gallantry. Of course, now her thoughts shifted to what it would take to penetrate that armor like a sword through a can of anchovies. Her smirk went from flirty to devilish.(\"May the best combatant win!\")\"Backatcha. Don't go easy on me just because I'm not as shiny as you.\" She winked.She took a couple of steps back and drew the sky blue sword, its luster glimmering prominently in the light. She also removed her buckler from her waist and held it out in front of her with her left. Then she took her sword and held it behind the buckler so that the point was underneath her armpit. Her right foot was forward, her left was back, and her body seemed to tighten like a spring.(\"Talent verses experience! New verses old! The match you didn't know wanted until you saw it!\")Did he just call me old? What the- nevermind.(\"Begin!\")The purpose of her stance suddenly became clear as the air around her changed. It was as if the heat of her surroundings was being magnetically drawn into her chest area, and a violent aura of miraging air enveloped her torso. The air shrieked with danger as mana energy rapidly built up around her chest area. Her weapon, shield, and torso started to\u00a0glow. But her stance kept everything tight so it was impossible to determine what sort of attack she was planning to launch. Her fame meant that there were several signature opening moves Daedalus could anticipate, involving her sword, shield, or body. But it would not be clear what was the focus since everything was grouped together, in a stance that also seemed well equipped at counter-attacking no less.Jun knew little about Daedelus, but reasoned that he would probably do his homework on her in case they fought. Hence she resolved from the very opening half second she would be ready for anything.", "1515562523000": "The tug of war of energy recruitment was not long on Jun, nor was Daedalus' attempt to take control of the terrain.Keep the ground then.The energy Jun had gathered had been focused on her chest, and as Daedalus' spell propagated so too did Jun's. It exploded from her heart and reached out to the rest of her limbs in the form of a white, quartz-like material. But unlike true rock, this material was both solid and malleable. In just a second, her entire body was encased and protected in a floating construct of light.But this wasn't a usual construct, not some mundane golem. Instead, its core, which temporarily housed Jun's entire body, was a glittering octohedron. Her silhouette was visible and still in a defensive position even inside. Extending from three points of the floating structure were tendrils of white light. Approximately ten meters long each, the tendrils tapered into sharp points at the ends.The structure hummed as it floated above the icy floor. Then, it lurched straight towards Daedalus. Two of the long tendrils stretched outwards as if they wanted to give Daedalus a biiiiiiiig\u00a0hug. The third stretched up above to help cut off Daedalus' escape.", "1515568536000": "Jun's light construct tendrils slammed against the ice spires with loud, dull thuds which were audible throughout the arena. She backed off, feeling the intense impact of the solid wall. The structure floated back and rose up into the air to avoid most of the spikes. Octohedrons are notoriously strong shapes, and even a direct hit onto the structure was almost guaranteed to be mitigated by the structure's sloping walls, bouncing it away instead of piercing it. Not that the structure was indestructible, but like most gemstones, sharp pointy things were usually not the answer.Still, the sheer power and volume of Daedalus' spell was troubling. The ice aura had covered the entire field in such a short amount of time. And during their tug of war, Jun got the distinct impression that he too could absorb heat energy from his surroundings, suggesting that fire might actually make the spell stong-Jun got a hilarious idea.As the octohedron floated back, one of its tendrils quickly reached into its core and seemed to phase through, touching her silhouette for just a moment before pulling itself back out and extracting what looked like a golden disc with a blue gem in the middle. It was Jun's buckler.The tendril hurled the metal object straight into the air just above Daedalus, where hopefully it would fall, guided by the ice spikes, and conk Daedalus straight on his helmet.Of course that wasn't the only part of her plan, as evidenced by the blue gem pulsating rapidly as it flew into the sky. Daedalus would probably sense it drawing power from Jun's mana pool, assuming he saw it coming.Still, Jun really, really hoped it would conk him on the head, just for laughs.", "1515706769000": "This is gonna be so good.The fact that the buckler even got close to Daedalus was enough. Like a bomb with a flickering timer, the buckler's gem went off just as it was going to be thrown back.BAWOOSH!An explosive torrent of water rushed out of the gem, as if it was manifesting an oversized, ethereal fire hydrant in midair. The buckler seemed to have a mind of its own now, as it held fast to the air and attempted to douse Daedalus with what would eventually amount to an olympic-swimming pool's worth of water!Jun reasoned that Daedalus' spell was designed to convert as much moisture in the atmosphere as possible into ice, and that it could appropriate ambient energy in order to do so. Thus in order to weaken the spell, she would have to force it to do more work. And freezing a massive amount of water suddenly in a short time frame to prevent Daedalus from being drowned from above (or at least save him the hypothermia of being soaked while surrounded by ice) would be the perfect way to weaken the spell. The best part was, even if the water was all frozen, it would contaminate his spell with ice that was laced with Jun's mana. All of his ice would be infected with ice owned by Jun, which would prove problematic to him as the fight dragged on.Jun's light construct was beginning to weaken. But that was alright. Her silhouette was just visible to the audience. It appeared to be in a meditative state. The tendrils were beginning to withdraw back into the octohedron to conserve the spell's power, as light started to absorb back into her body. Between preparing for her next attack and influencing Daedalus ice, she felt confident enough to meet the next challenge Daedalus would present her.", "1516080040000": "Jun's water had one last surprise in it. As it cascaded down upon the dragon, it didn't exactly hit the ground.The buckler remained affixed above the dragon, serving as a core for a large, floating mass of water. Laced with Jun's mana, the water had developed the impetus to protect Jun from harm. Although it wasn't nearly as voluminous as the dragon, it was enough to encase the creature's neck while maintaining tendrils and protrusions all over its shimmering surface. As the dragon prepared to launch its attack, the water would hold fast to the dragon's neck and wrench to the side in order to derail the beam. Even as this was happening, tendrils of water started to extend menacingly towards the creature's mouth.The light construct shifted in the opposite direction to ensure that Jun would not be hit by the beam. This also carried her away from any lingering pernicious effects hidden in the ice spires left behind near her. The last of the construct's energy was absorbed into Jun's sky blue sword just as she descended on the ground. She hit the dirt with a thud, holding up her weapon, which glimmered violently. She seemed to have it aimed at the mass of water which was assaulting the dragon. She leered at the beast, seemingly unconcerned that she was now exposed.", "1516307810000": "Jun noticed that her water was beginning to freeze even while its breath was sent off course, and that she felt no resulting bond with the ice. Then the dragon attempted to leap forward...With a sweep of her opposite hand, she relinquished her mana from all the water and drew that mana into her body, where it would conduct its way through her and into her glimmering sword.All the water would suddenly cascade down onto the dragon's body. It was no longer Jun's water, but just water, meaning that Daedalus' mana would have nothing to fight against as it sought to freeze the water and appropriate the ice for itself. The water would drench its mouth and limbs and freeze much more quickly. The unexpected lack of resistance would catch Daedalus' dragon off guard, like a wrestler unexpectedly moving with the opponent's force rather than against it. The water would now freeze much more quickly.Numerous problems would arise for the dragon. The water would potentially form an icy cast around its neck, joints of its legs, and claws, which was bad news for a dragon trying to run at full gallop. Even if the dragon was strong enough to break the ice, the unexpected clog in its motion in the form of jagged ice crystals around its elbows and knees would likely cause the dragon to trip and fall. The sheer weight of the water suddenly crashing down on it might shift its center of gravity forward, possibly sending the dragon careening into the ground as it attempted to leap. If nothing else, its impossibly fridged claws would suddenly freeze the water running down it to the ground, perhaps sticking it to the dirt, or even creating a frozen glove which wouldn't have the same traction against the now muddy sand as its regular claws would.It was unlikely that all of these complications would arise simultaneously, but really Jun only needed one or two to be a factor to buy her that extra second.And during that extra second Jun would aim the point of her sword straight at the dragon's core. The sword would glow even more violently with the extra time to build up power and the energy taken from the water. Jun's aura suddenly flared out, bathing her surroundings in an ominous orange glow. The sword would no longer appear sky blue, but rather a molten red. Sparks of mana would crackle around it like lightning bolts as Jun took aim...", "1516648027000": "Jun would accept the consequences of making the dragon stronger as it barreled towards her.Just as it reached her, Jun's body ignited in a blaze of flames. The torrent of plasma roared as she rocketed forward towards Daedelus' dragon feet like a meteor. The flames would cause little damage to Jun herself and would help protect her against the dragon's icy magic as they sped her forward. Her blazing hot blade would collide with the dragon's leg. If it was regular ice, it would have sliced right through, leaving a deep gash, and the intense heat would have flash melted the ice around the cut, resulting in an explosion of steam. If for some reason the ice resisted the attack, Jun's blade would bounce off, but it wouldn't affect her overall trajectory; she would come to a skidding halt in the muddy sand where Daedalus had once been.The intense heat given off by Jun's body would vaporize the water in the sand, creating a billowing steam cloud all around her. She would use it as cover as she quickly deposited a magic scroll in the sand and strafed sideways. The scroll would unfurl, and the glyphs which were drawn into it would start glowing faintly, though they would not be visible in the cloud of steam.", "1517160191000": "As the curtain of steam rose up and dissipated, Jun appeared facing Daedalus in an en guard stance. Flames continued to lick her sword and body without consuming her.She was breathing deeply. Her ward showed a similar level of damage around her boots, although it was somewhat obscured by her flames. She had a very good idea of what she was up against now.\"You know, I wouldn't be embarrassed to lose to you! Hope the feeling's mutual!\" She called out to Daedalus while waiting for the water to reach a certain point. She had been planning to use her own water for the trap later on, but as the melted water from the dragon once again threatened to change the battlefield, she knew she had no choice. The second the puddle came near enough to her scroll, she snapped her fingers.The scroll disintegrated, replaced by a ball of pale blue light. The ball burst a fraction of a second later into dozens of great arcs of lightning, dancing and interplaying as a great dynamic web. The great basket of electrical arcs then blitzkrieged along the water towards Daedalus, burning zigzagging trails of steam into the pool as they traveled along.", "1517505000000": "Jun growled, increasingly frustrated that her attempts to outsmart Daedalus were less than successful. But she wasn't about to lose confidence in her analytical skills just yet. She at least knew that after solid and liquid, the third state of matter was gas.She thrust her sword to the side. The last of her flames burst outward in a pulse of thin flaming ribbons and hot air. After dismissing her flame cloak, she waved her free hand theatrically over the battlefield and then brought the cloth of her armor's inner elbow over her nose and lips. Then she started backing away, her eyes darting around for any sign of Daedalus' presence, the tenseness of her chest scanning for any unusual mana signature around her.After waving her hand, the sand at her feet would begin to swirl around her feet and rise higher and higher. The air howled as if beckoning Daedalus to bring it on.", "1517698930000": "Aside from a brief sense of validation for investing in extra groin protection in the armor (due to an unfortunate mishap in a previous mission), Jun stayed calm. Just as Daedalus had warded his armor against cold, Jun's helmet had been blessed to mitigate a single spell. The water drill at her feet would struggle to pierce through an invisible wall, slowing it down just enough for the swirling mass of sand around her to increase in power and volume and then thrash the water away.The air that roared around Jun wasn't mana influencing the air itself, but a violent torrent of mana which pulled at the sand beneath their feet upwards like a siphon; it just happened to be powerful enough to influence the air around her. The longer she focused, the more sand would ally itself with her and the greater her sphere of influence would grow.Jun sensed the multiple mana signatures from Daedalus. She hardly cared anymore. She was sick and tired of trying to outsmart Daedalus, trying to find the weaknesses in his stratagems. She resolved to instead beat him at his own game. If her mouth was uncovered it'd be bellowing. It would take more than a prodigy to beat her!", "1518568032000": "By now there was so much sand around her that it almost formed a solid dome. As soon as Daedalus appeared his armor would clang heavily with chunks of sand. The great sand cloud would react by surging forward, a great amorphous mass which from the audience perspective would look like a giant brown amoeba about to swallow its prey.Jun was prepared for many things. She was ready to fight a second ice dragon. She was ready to deal with toxic water clouds which would infest her lungs and take over her brain. She was prepared to take on any wild but masterful scheme that Daedalus concocted.Somehow she was not prepared for a magical laser cannon to the face.As he fired the beam, the sand would attempt to intercept, quickly taking on the form of a swirling cone in front of her, using the momentum it had gained from trying to swallow him to instead form the appropriate shape. The beam would melt through the sand, but the sand's impetus to push against the beam would result in the hot molten glass to surge forward as a crown from the impact point, dousing Daedalus. The audience would see it almost as an erupting sideways volcano.If the beam was powerful enough it would eventually cut through and reach Jun, finishing her off, but not before Daedalus was covered in molten glass. ", "1518989442000": "The sudden flare in mana alarmed Jun, and triggered flashbacks of her fight with Vigil. She didn't know how to use portals, but she was familiar with their usage in battle. They were not fun.A drilling surge of pure sand would snap to and launch into Jun's side, an attempt to knock herself out of the way of the second laser attack. This would likely result in damage to her own body, but it was better than being caught by a magical beam of death.\u00a0 She'd stagger out of the way, her eyes flailing wildly towards the other mana signatures. She would draw Resonance and rapidly build up energy for a desperate counter-measure.The molten glass would likely not be a lethal blow against Daedalus' armor, but it would cause intense heat and an irritating orange glow which might affect his ability to concentrate.", "1504319893000": "\"Hey.\"Jun's voice called out to Alden from within the shadowy gate tunnel. Her form walked at a steady pace. To her side something emitting a faint blue light bounced at her hip with each step. When she emerged, he would find her wearing simple, unassuming grey robes and a sympathetic smile.On her shoulder was her renowned sidekick Blackbean, who looked about as battle-ready as a crow could be (he even had a tiny brigandine of his own to boot). Slung to her side was a leather pack which appeared to be filled with packages and some scrolls. Jun had clearly done some prep work before coming here. Most noticeable was the source of the blue light, a lustrous, chrome blue sword which went by the name Resonance.\"So...\" Jun knew that Alden had probably been lost in thought while he was waiting, and she understood how emotionally significant this mission was. So it was with some hesitation that she reached into her pack to pull out a small bag.\"I um... I brought snacks.\" She smiled sheepishly.", "1504404214000": "\"Of course. We're friends. It's no trouble. And I do have plenty of food, plus I'm a decent forager. You forget I used to travel a lot before I met Lady Naoki.\" She reached into the pouch and pulled out some bits of candied fruit for Alden to try. \"It just seems appropriate. Call it woman's intuition.\" She would be rather insistent that he sample a bite.He would notice it was the same kind of fruit that she had given the children. Gut feelings being hard to explicate, her gesture was meant to remind him of his children, both as a comfort and a symbol for the innocence that he was fighting for, the innocence that his former master had no regard for and would so callously trample on for the sake of weaponizing people.She didn't want him to forget that this world, with its playful children and candied fruit, was just as real as the horrible place they were about to enter.\"Try the papaya one. Try it! There's plenty for your other volunteer too. Speaking of which, where are they?\" She turned to squint into the gate tunnel.", "1504410564000": "\"Heh...\" It took a few seconds to process everything he said and come up with a response, in no small part because he brought up things about her that she'd spent a long time thinking about. \"I guess I used to be afraid of people who I knew could do things that I couldn't. I'd like to think I've grown up a bit since then and have learned to appreciate those things about people instead.\" Jun took a bit of banana chip and popped it into her mouth. \"You know, I don't think I ever told you this, but in someways I'm quite self-centered.\" She popped another banana chip in her mouth. \"I guess a more polite way of saying it would be introspective. Every cloud has a silver lining after all, and it's something I'm learning to work with. You know, there's a certain holy dragon in the Black Tower organization you might want to get in touch with...\"Jun realized she might be eating too many of the snacks and closed up the bag.\"You're easy to like once people get to know you, and you're a wonderful father. You're part of the reason why I'd like to have children someday... that is, if you don't think that's strange. It's one of those things I've always been insecure about. I never considered myself the most stable human being. But for someone like you, who has endured so much, to be able to settle down and have a family, it helps give oddities like myself hope, y'know?\"Once she was done rambling, her lips flattened and her face turned slightly pink. That was a lot of information she had just disclosed about herself....And then Kaylie came.\"Oh thank god.\" She muttered to herself before turning to the Marshall. \"Hey!\" The sun metal glinted in, well, the sun, and Jun grinned with Kaylie's palpable enthusiasm. \"They look beautiful. I'm sure they were well worth the effort. My name is Jun by the way.\" She held her hand out to the newcomer. \"And you must be Marshall Imrahil. Nice bow.\"Blackbean seemed to caw in agreement.", "1452638117000": "Just as Daemonlord Maelik struggled to not make a fool of himself, there would be a flash of blue light and Jun would appear a few feet above Maelik.\"MAELIK!\" She'd come crashing down on his back, glomping him furiously!\"How've you been?! Sorry I couldn't help myself I just haven't seen you in so long and- MASTER LUMMIE!\"There was another blinding flash of blue light and Jun would appear right in front of Lum'Valia and hug her too.She had spotted them from the air while searching for Lum'Valia.", "1452640670000": "\"Oh, I'm sorry Maelik, here, let me fix that.\" She quickly turned around and winked at Lum'Valia before turning back to the now decimated chocolate heart. She extended her hand at it. \"Vokrii!\"The splattered heart fragments would rise into the air and assemble themselves on a sort of light-construct matrix shaped like a heart. In just a few seconds the chocolate heart was reassembled into its original chocolate-y glory.She turned towards Arya, hopping in place excitedly like a kangaroo. \"Master Lummie taught me how to do that. Practically drove me insane while doing it. I'm Jun by the way.\"", "1452662012000": "Jun stopped hopping up and down as she was getting tired.\"Yah, Lummie was the one who taught me light magic in the first place. She was going to teach me holy magic right afterwards, but I decided to leave to go meet another dragon. It's a long story but, let's just say the two dragons weren't exactly friends, and there was a possibility he'd teach me something... not so holy. Fortunately that didn't happen.\"She was somewhat indignant that Lum'Valia had to \"touch up\" her work.\"So what's your story? How did you end up meeting Lum'Valia?\"", "1452714637000": "However Arya responded to her inquiry, Jun would whisper loudly and mischievously to Lum'Valia, not actually intending to be clandestine. \"GO FOR IT... FREE CHOCHOLATE...\"", "1452738876000": "\"You know, Maelik used to be friends with Princess Camilla Eremae of Medan, and me and him fought a wraith together. Not only that, but alignment does vary among demons. My crows are true neutral, for instance.\"She turned to Arya. \"Oh wow, you're probably the closest thing to a normal friend I've made in a while.\"", "1452751718000": "Jun grinned. \"Well, I doubt we'll turn out enemies or strangers, especially with Lummie teaching us holy magic. Might as well accept the inevitable.\"She turned to Maelik. \"When we're done maybe you can make us all a feast to celebrate. Me and Lummie can cook, but our abilities must pale in comparison to yours!\"She wondered if anyone would sense this \"suggestion\" of hers served the dual purpose of copping a free meal.", "1452802865000": "\"Arya, good and evil come in all shapes and sizes. Trust me, if Maelik is the first demon you've ever encountered, consider yourself lucky. I've seen entities far more evil that him...\"\"So, what's the plan then?\" She looked around at everyone, particularly Lum'Valia, for direction. \"Oh and that reminds me, where did Doobie du Shoobie go?!\"", "1452837835000": "\"Doobie! Link arms with us!\" She flicked her hair in Lum'Valia's direction. \"And Arya, part of being generous is understanding that we're all connected as people. So it's ok to take a handout once in a while as long as you repay the kindness, even if it's someone different in need.\"Of course Jun had no idea how malicious Maelik could be and that he may or may not be planning to do something unsavory to the food.She responded to Lum'Valia. \"Believe it or not, nothing evil. Fundor simply taught me how to absorb heat energy from my surroundings, including my own spells. He also taught me some draconic and how to use draconic to form wards.\"", "1584043014000": "With the city bathed in chaos, the assailants could be forgiven for missing the little things. What is the pinprick of an ant\u2019s minuscule jaws on your ankles to the biting blades of dozens of guardsmen? What is a creeping spider's web to the acrid haze of melting coins and burning tapestries? What is a mosquito\u2019s buzz to the wails of a charred corpse whose heart hadn\u2019t quite stopped? A crawling weed, a sea bird's wing beats, the clickety-clack of a stray dog\u2019s gallop, a single bur attached to a blue blood\u2019s slacks...In the city\u2019s death throes, they weren\u2019t even proper background noise.A blue blood berserker slips on an acorn. He gets up and continues his murder spree. Another one trips on a vine growing out of a sewer grate. A minor inconvenience. Doubtful Wrath would notice the caustic stickiness of an exploding termite\u2019s sacrifice on his heels.A brave red-bellied wren attempts to foul Sloth\u2019s bow.A blue blood clumsily tripping over itself once is a coincidence. But what about twice? What about three times? Exactly how many weeds lived in Isra\u2019s sewers? How many termites did it take to carpet the street and eat away Wrath\u2019s boots? How many ants and spiders could fit inside Sloth\u2019s pant legs?How many birds, insects, and bats did it take to blacken Isra\u2019s skies?The blue bloods lit up the magical landscape of Isra like a swarm of fireflies. It was easy to not notice nigh invisible specks of magical influence empowering the new wave of Isra\u2019s defenders. Only when the spell went from being nowhere to being everywhere would they notice it. The stray dogs were coordinating to distract the blue bloods from the innocent, and their bones and teeth were now strong as steel. The roaches were eating away at various victims' destroyed flesh, which strangely began to grow anew with every milligram of spittle the detritivores left in the wounds. The spurs were growing into strange, sticky sundews that were consuming the blue blood's malignant magic. Seagulls and ravens were circling, with some beginning to dive. The ant\u2019s jaws were infused with lightning. The termite's blood burned.Having crept up as quietly and patiently as a fog, the magical influence was now everywhere. A new champion had arrived. Now, what is a feller of nations to an extremely pissed-off farm girl hiding in the sewers? Time to find out.", "1586734109000": "A wave of righteous fury passed through the air like a thunderclap.By releasing a rather significant pulse of mana into the city, Jun risked giving away her position. Her injury made her particularly vulnerable in close-quarters combat, and she knew if she fell, the attackers would rebound and doom Isra for sure. But that was a risk she was willing to take. The epicenter of the phenomenon could be sensed by those of magical inclination as somewhere underground, at the bazaar's border adjacent to the city, slowly and steadily getting closer. Her exact position, however, would still be clouded by the thousands of small mana points being generated by the flora and fauna rebellion.A rainfall of whistles and shrieks blanketed the city as thousands of birds and bats began to dive. Golden embers of fire energy fell from their feathers and fur, strange ignition sources that burned those of evil intent while sparing the innocent and anything actually flammable. While perhaps not lethal, this spell served to compliment the beaks and claws of Isra's new avian allies, blinding their foes and distracting them with second-degree burns.Despite her best efforts, Isra really did look doomed.However, there was a glimmer of hope. Jun sensed that her anti-magic wasn't having the desired effect. This was, by itself, an important clue. There must have been more to the phenomenon than the blue blood body itself. And while she couldn't see the entire map of carnage, she could feel how the efforts of her living creatures were being distributed. This gave her a surprisingly accurate picture of the size and scope of the attack. Maybe the epicenter was the key...But she couldn't leave her position to deal with it herself. If she did, she'd lose focus on her massive area spell, which was the only major resistance the city had so far. She also wasn't sure if she was ready to face the orchestrators or even a swarm of blue bloods head-on, the shadow of her damaged arm looming over her psyche. Also, she was getting used to the scent of piss water. Go figure.She concentrated. There must be other people fighting back. Guards, heroes, elite warriors, cattle raisers, someone.Anyone.CAN ANYONE HEAR ME?Her magic once again flowed out into the city, once again putting her at risk of detection. But if Isra was to stand a chance, it needed more heroes.A few of the animals and plants would glow with purple eyes and leaves.YOU CAN TRUST THE ANIMALS!She strained. Who knew defending an entire city was so much work?An image of the approximate radius of the phenomenon would flash in people's minds.Her heart was beating irregularly.\u00a0Her eyes felt like they were going to explode.ANTI-MAGIC WON'T SAVE THEM!An image of a blue blood crumbling would flash in their minds.THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE! SOMETHING IN THE MIDDLE!She clenched her teeth. She wasn't going to lose.DO... NOT GIVE UP!", "1589860144000": "Jun desperately wished she could greet Vaelar, and only Vaelar through the maelstrom of activity. But there was so much to do and so little time, the best she could do was have a nearby guard dog give an affirming nod that he likely wouldn't notice. Jun smirked at Boscoe being Boscoe-She suddenly remembered Boscoe had human-like intelligence.Her mind continued to survey the battlefield, coordinating as much as she could. It was so difficult. So many magical energies intermingling, each customized to a different animal. It was like trying to make a stew by heating every droplet, trying to direct an army one fingernail at a time. Even Lum'Valia's mind split training hadn't prepared her for this. And yet, Boscoe had gotten the message. He was heading for the epicenter. Was Isra to be saved by a giant scorpion-lion-bat thing?Now, Jun had also noticed that her animal's holy flames weren't damaging the blue bloods. Tenacious bastards.And then she had a flashback.It seemed ages ago, when Jun, Alden, and Kaylie entered the forested keep, and Jun met the leader of the Set. She remembered she promised to refer to Gluttony as Gorilla Hips. She remembered taking a spear to the crotch and being turned into a pin cushion by light tracking arrows. It was not a very fun day. She remembered traps and sand golems. How did the sand golems work? Something about the Blue Bloods reminded her of them...That's IT! A POWER SOURCE! THERE'S A POWER SOURCE IN THE EPICENTER! SEARCH THE BUILDING IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL THI-Her telepathic message to Boscoe, Vaelar, and Megan was interrupted by a stone clink just above Jun's head. Horror dawned in her heart, so deep that the emotion would probably leech into her final message. From having worked with Kaylie, she could sense what explosive arrows were like.... Fuck you Slo-(Static)A substantial chunk of Jun's ambient magic suddenly dissipated like dust in the wind. In particular, it was the birds who were possessed by holy flames that lost their powers and started to fly off in a panic.\u00a0But there were still a lot of animals and plants fighting back. Roaches, sparrows, dogs, vines, and bats continued to oppose the Blue Bloods and the two members of the Set. But no, the ambient spell had definitely lost some potency. What had happened? Was Jun still alive? Or did the spell simply have a lot of staying power regardless of what happened to the caster?", "1594326493000": "The arrow's blast had left a large, concave dent in the earth. On one end was a large drop off that, when looking down, opened into a odorous sewer tunnel. At the other end was a slope composed entirely of jagged chunks of rock and debris.As Vaelar fought his way towards the rubble, the rocks would shiver and bulge. Then, a large black mass would burst out of the pile, with such force that chunks of rock would fly several meters in different directions.Blackbean's anguished cry would likely distract the Blue Bloods and grab Vaelar's attention, just enough for him to have the presence of mind to grab the object that Blackbean tossed towards Vaelar's feet with its beak. It was a small scroll with an inscription on it.The massive crow, whose cataphract armor tore away from it with bloody feathers and entangled into the rubble, then collapsed. Its head splashed into a small stream of piss water and it lay there, prone. Its chest heaved rapidly and its bulging eyes glimmered in the sun. More blood dripped from its wings and mixed into the water.Jun's magic continued to fade away. The dogs, still fighting back, were now doing so with enamel teeth and vulnerable bones. Most of the other animals, especially insects, were becoming lost and disoriented. Though one particularly brave hummingbird continued to hunt Sloth's eyeball with a passion.The scroll, pulsating with magic, seemed to beg Vaelar to open it immediately.Remember my sense of humor, loveVaelar was angry. Vaelar was anguished. Vaelar's blood was boiling. Jun's school of magic interpreted this as the sword of yin. Darkness was the defender of the self. It was not evil. In fact, Vaelar would need it now more than ever.Thick black vines coiled up from within the scroll. Yes, get angry. The city needs you to get angry. The vines darted up his arms like snakes, depositing a hot, red, vicious magic into him. Fight back. Fight with everything you've got. Tear the earth apart with your tears of anguish. Let your heart burn. Thick black orchids sprouted in the gaps of his armor. He'd feel his heart race and then steady, his senses sharpen, his strength increase, his muscles twitching like lightning.A harsh buzzing cascaded out from the sewer tunnel. A cloud of blackness floated up and towards him. With every furious breath Vaelar took, the cloud would expand and contract. Their wing beats deafened.In addition to his strength and speed increases, Vaelar was now lord of the flies. The tiny, but innumerable, allies were under his control, at least for now.While only a fraction of what Jun herself could offer, her final gift to Vaelar was not to be underestimated.SPOILER: Click to showMeanwhile, a dazed and mangled Jun hobbled through the back end of the sewer network, away from where the explosion had been. Emitting more blood than mana, she none-the-less struggled to find a path underground towards the epicenter. But the odds of her getting there before the heroes on the surface did were slim. And her magic was nearly unusable now, lest she risk a second strike from Sloth's bow. ", "1597863570000": "The concussive force of the mana explosion brought her to her knees. Half prostrated, hands covered in blood and sewer slime, she struggled to keep her breath steady.Then the water started soaking through the knees and shins of her padded armor, and she felt the wet cold creeping towards her thighs, threatening her undergarments.\"Ew ew ew!\" She jolted up and then collapsed against the significantly drier sidewall. \"Ugh, I'm going to get infected after this. Can't even heal.\"Seriously, f*ck Sloth.She lay there, thinking bitterly about the horrific nature of her enemies. They used addiction to prey on the vulnerable, who, in turn, destroyed the city. Of course, this must have been Pride's scheme. It was the scheme of a kidnapper and murderer of children, the one who made Alden a killing machine. How ironic that demons and dragons should be feared and reviled in a world where the evilest individuals always turned out to be human.\"Blackbean.\" She wept. \"Hang in there.\"She could vaguely sense Meghan's presence. The girl was immensely powerful. There was always a shred of solidarity to be found in a fellow female caster.Jun blinked. \"SON OF A BITCH!\" Her hand snapped to her side, and she drew out an azure blue longsword. Meghan was a spellcaster. If Sloth had another explosive arrow on him-No, she refused to let that happen. She needed to take a risk. It seemed like the Blue Bloods were defeated, so maybe she wouldn't be spotted. She grabbed a seed from a pouch on her gambeson and stuck it to Resonance like a little blob of chewing gum. The faintest bit of magic flowed from her body into the seed, and Resonance itself started to glow. \"Easy, wait until you get outside.\" She forced her hobbled legs towards the nearest sewer grate so she could toss the sword out into Isra's streets.It'd land with a clatter onto the stone. Jun shuffled away while trying to focus her will onto the sword remotely. After a few seconds, it would begin to shine like a beacon of mana, and hopefully serve as a sort of decoy in case Sloth was lurking for a priority target.Of course, the sword wouldn't remain idle. Some of the surrounding mana from the explosion would begin absorbing into the seed Jun had pasted onto it. Resonance itself would lend its power. And it would start sprouting.It felt awkward leaving an important weapon behind, but she knew she couldn't survive another explosive arrow blast, especially since Blackbean wasn't around to shield her. She cursed herself for not being at full strength. But then she reminded herself that Vaelar wouldn't want her to curse herself.Speaking of which,As Vaelar's empowered form tore through the maddened crowds, thick, ropey trails of flies escorted him. They latched onto eyeballs and thundered against eardrums, making it exceeding hard to steel oneself against Vaelar's strikes.When the Blue Bloods finally lost power, the flies, as if conscious of the change in the air, stopped attacking. Instead, they floated triumphantly around Vaelar like a menacing fog. There was a slight bulge to the shape they made around him, however, a sort of magnetic attraction. They were pointing in the direction of thundering footfalls and continued screaming. There was one last opponent left to face. And he was a wrathful one.", "1475257408000": "It was evening. Jun was dressed out of armor, instead wearing a simple grey sweaterdress and white cotton slacks. She was carrying a bottle of local fruit juice. Why fruit juice? Because in some ways Jun was still as ignorant of urban social norms as Alden and she wasn't sure if it was appropriate to bring wine to a household with children. She also brought some rolls of bread.She knocked on the door, waiting to see what Alden's household was like. As she gazed across the quaint wooden and brick structure, she senses the presence of wards. Logical, she thought to herself.", "1475263327000": "\"Oh.\" Jun grinned when she saw the little girl. Aw, how cu- she has cat eats.Nope, taking it for granted. Taking it for granted.\"Hi Juniper!\" She knelt down and said in a faux exaggerated nanny voice. \"My name is Jun. I'm one of daddy's friends.\" She hoped that Alden was in fact \"daddy\" and that Juniper wasn't over for a play date or something. That might be awkward. \"Is he home right now?\"", "1475287515000": "Jun beamed. Alden was a good father. When Alden was done she walked over to them and placed her gifts on the closest suitable flat surface. \"I'm sorry if I startled you Juniper.\" She said.\"They seem very well mannered. You're doing a good job raising them. Who is their mother?\"", "1475289565000": "\"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. At least they still have you, that and this Miss Higgs lady.\"They went up to his study, but not before Jun grabbed a bread roll.After they arrive at the study, Jun gratefully takes a seat. \"Well, I'm not sure I have a satisfactory answer for that. I guess hearing people's stories is just, important to me, especially since I became a holy mage. I like seeing more of what's outside myself. To me it's kind of like adventuring. But, it's also kind of a difficult thing to pursue. Not everyone is an open book about their lives. So I've refrained from asking people randomly. Actually this would probably be the first story I've heard in a while.\"Not sure what else to say, Jun started nibbling on the bread roll she had brought.", "1475293650000": "By the time Alden had finished his lengthy tale, most of Jun's bread roll had been largely untouched. The bit that she had chewed on at the beginning finally went down, about as easily as a hunk of pummice.With a voice like shattered glass, Jun said, \"Are there any others like you?\"", "1475295584000": "\"What bothers me the most,\" Jun said furiously, \"is that there are people out there who would do that to a child. I mean to anyone but you must have been, what not even a teenager! That's insane! That is absolutely insane.\"By the time Jun was done she found herself standing up right, with a crushed bread roll in one of her fists.\"Now it makes sense. Lady Naoki's human rights thing. It wasn't just Goraia, but also your story.\"Jun took a deep breath. \"I'm sorry. I'm sorry if my reaction bothered you in anyway. And I do appreciate your story.  I really do. It's just... I never imagined this world could be that cruel. I mean I heard some things happened in the Land-Tiller's Expanse during the civil war but I wasn't alive in those days so...\"Once she had calmed down a little bit she started picking at the bread roll, trying to restore it to its former shape. She was still standing.", "1475337700000": "Jun mulled over what Alden said. It was perfectly logical of course, but still. Her eyes floated around the room downcast and her lips were pressed upwards. She was embarrassed by her own reaction.\"I guess you're right. I know your right. Huh, what am I doing?\" As she was picking apart the crushed bread roll she realized she had somehow forgotten she was a holy mage. \"Vokrii.\" The bread roll returned to its pristine condition with a flash of light, albeit with a small bite taken out of it. Little sparks of residual energy floated away from the snack.\"I uh... I brought bread rolls.\" She pointed back downstairs with a sheepish grin. \"And juice. I uh, I was gonna bring some wine but I wasn't sure if that was appropriate to a household with kids in it.\"", "1475362631000": "\"Umm... I'll need some time to gather up my thoughts, but I'd like to stay and help out with dinner if you don't mind. I'm a pretty decent cook actually.\"Assuming Jun was welcome to stay, she'd head downstairs with Alden.In whatever activity followed Jun would eventually have a series of thoughts on what she had just heard. \"I'm curious, if it's not too much trouble, how were you able to recover from your ordeal? If we manage to find more people like you, or really anyone who was the victim of, well, anything comparable-\" She didn't want to use the word torture in earshot of the kids. \"-Your insight would probably be extremely valuable in helping them recover.\"", "1475365667000": "Jun rather enjoyed seeing the children play monster slayer. She offered to give them little \"power ups\" in the form of colorful mana sparkles to help slay Alden. But his sparkle power resistances proved much too high and he landed a tickle critical hit on one of the children.In response to Alden, Jun nodded. \"That makes sense. And I'm very happy for you. You probably know that I've had a few nasty experiences as an adult, but for the most part my life has been fairly blessed. All my near death experiences have been consensual, so to speak. I wish I could relate to your story somehow, maybe even help other people who have been through what you've been through.\"A part of her was a little disappointed that Ms. Higgs was gonna do all the work. Isranian\u00a0kitchens were generally more complex and intricate than those in the Expanse. It was fun cooking in them.", "1475369822000": "Jun decides she will ponder the whole ordeal a bit later. She realized that being lost in her thoughts would ruin her enjoyment of being around Alden and his family. Not to mention the fact that the stew was excellent. Jun tried to avoid eating messily. She took advantage of the bread to sop up every drop of stew that threatened to leave the confines of her bowl. She even tried to avoid making excessive slurping sounds.\"I might need to ask your advice someday if I ever decide to have kids. I don't wanna stop adventuring and learning about the world, even when I'm older. It'll be tough balancing that and raising young ones though. Speaking of which, I don't think we were properly introduced?\" Indeed she could only recall Juniper's name. \"How old are they anyways?\"Tonight her respect for the Sun Marshall leader had risen immeasurably. Not only was he the survivor of something horrific, but he was a single father, and a good one at that. The fact that he was a gardener was just icing on the cake.", "1475371970000": "I need to have kids someday.\"Well now! It's good to meet you all! I'm Jun. Hey, our names kinda sound the same huh?\" She looked at Juniper. She seemed like the smart one. The shy ones were usually pretty smart. Jun was a little surprised, but pleased, to see that Lady Naoki had taken an interest in Alden's family. She wasn't sure who this Moon person could be, although her name sounded familiar.\"I'm actually friends with Auntie Naoki. How is she? Is she nice to you?\" A thought occurred to her that perhaps Naoki took an interest in these children because, like her, they had feline characteristics. She then remembered that Naoki had adopted a vampire girl named Skarlet. It was odd, she didn't peg her as the motherly type. But then again she hadn't pegged Alden as the fatherly type. Clearly she was an awful judge of character. She would have to remember that in the future.", "1475376615000": "If Jun knew their family dynamics well enough she could probably relate to Juniper. She knew what it was like to constantly be overshadowed by a powerful family member after all. She did sort of sense that something was amiss. And so she beamed as soon as Alden picked her up. \"I don't know too many people with blue hair. It's very cool looking.\" She said. She was hoping this would make Juney feel a bit better about herself while relating to some of her siblings.\"Alden, is it alright if I get your kids something for their next birthday?\"As an aside, she was a bit surprised the kids seemed so advanced for 2 year olds. She figured it must have something to do with their feline blood.", "1475379025000": "\"Uh... Ok hang on, I need a quill or pencil or something. Umm...\" Jun would ask Alden for a writing utensil and paper. When she got one she'd start scribbling. \"Ok uh, each of you give me your favorite color, and a favorite hobby.\"", "1475435714000": "\"Owange... and... dwawing... pwetty... piwtuws. Got it.\" She finishes scribbling and saves the paper. \"Ok, I'll make sure to get each of you something related to what you like.\" The large flock of children amused her to know end. Her own desire to have children increased more and more.After finishing up dinner, Jun decides she needs to leave. \"Ok, I need to go guys. Be good to each other ok?\" She'd tell the little pointy-eared rascals, perhaps even daring to ruffle their hair a bit. She had fallen in love with Juniper a bit more than the others. There was just something about her that she found relatable. She'd also turn to Alden. \"You have a wonderful family. I'm really grateful to have met them. Maybe next time I can meet your new friend, yah? And I'm also grateful to have heard your story. I mean it. And I think it's more important than you give it credit.\"", "1476217143000": "Jun returned some time after getting Alden's approval to conduct their interview. It was evening again, and Jun was wearing the same sweater dress. She decided fruit juice had gone over well last time and to bring two jugs of it instead of one. She also brought some bread and sweets for the kids. But more importantly, she had a bag with some quills, a notebook, and her magical recording devices.As she walked up the door, she put one of the bags down so she could part a stray bang of hair from her eyes. She smirked bitterly. She had almost forgotten that the man she had befriended had left her a parting gift, in the form of a little scar just in front of her temple, during their last amicable excursion. She rolled her eyes and tried to dismiss thoughts of asking for a rematch just before knocking on the door.", "1476427762000": "Jun forgets all about a rematch when she is swarmed by small children. \"Hey guys! Ok ok ok ok hang on I don't wanna drop this stuff on your heads!\" Jun quickly and carefully trotted over to a nearby table and plopped down her things. She give a quick acknowledging nod to Thaelyn before rummaging through her bags. \"Oh dear, which bag was it? AH!\" She pulled out a bag filled with sweets. Mostly it was dried sugary fruit imported from her homeland. But unlike the average Isranian citizen she didn't have to buy it from a shop. She could go straight to the source! She unwrapped the package and revealed the contents. There were dozens of pieces of candies in a veritable rainbow of colors. There was an orange, pasty bit that would taste like dried mango, hard little yellow bits like banana chips, and purple, green, and red bits with difficult to describe analogues. There were even a few large brown orbs which would taste like medjool dates. But what they all had in common was that they were all carefully made and would, hopefully, taste delicious to the small children.(Unlike most candies these also had some minor nutritional value.)As they inevitably swarmed her, Jun would keep an eye out for little Juniper, who happened to be her favorite (though she'd never admit it). She wanted to see which kind was her favorite. \"You can each have one piece but it's better to save the rest for after dinner ok kids? I also brought more juice!\"Now that the decoy was in place she could finally properly greet the pair back. \"Hi Marshall Alden... Get it? Because you're also the high marshall and I'm also saying hi? Get it? Get- nevermind. Thaelyn!\" Jun walked over and tried to offer a hug. Regardless of whether or not she was successful she'd still smile. \"It's nice to meet the happy couple!\"At this point one of the kids might go through the bag containing the magical recording devices which she accidentally bunched with the gifts.\"Oh, Alden, did you tell Thaelyn about my idea? I think we had an appointment so we could do it tonight. Actually, Thaelyn, it would probably be great if you could join us and weigh in.\"", "1476475863000": "Jun grinned when she saw the little girl favoring the banana chips. Next time she'd bring a whole bag just for her (ostensibly for everyone however).Jun still can't get over the variety of crazy hair colors people had. She really wanted to try dyeing her hair at some point. She shook her head and answered Thaelyn's inquiry. \"I was, but now that I've gotten to know him better it doesn't surprise me much anymore. I think you guys are an amazing family.\"She gulped when she realized that Thaelyn wasn't aware of the entire story, even if she knew the majority of it. Oh dear. Hopefully her project wouldn't have any major consequences on their relationship.Jun heads upstairs with the others towards the familiar study. As they walked up the stairs, Jun says (moreso to Thaelyn), \"The more I think about this, the more I'm convinced this is a good idea, especially with everyone talking about the rights of sapients right now. But, I'm still kinda nervous. I fear I'm being somewhat naive about this whole thing. But the world needs to know that abuse and torture are a real problem. Who knows? Maybe when the Goraian refugees read about Alden's story more of them will come forward about what they've been through, and Goraia will be pressured to change...\"They entered the familiar study and Jun started to pull out the things she needed. She switched on a recording device and set it to Alden. \"Now I'm having trouble deciding which side is more important though, what you've been through or how you regained your humanity afterwards.\" The device was ready and so was the quill in Jun's hand.", "1476501642000": "By the end of the first half of the interview Jun had gone from taking notes to drawing strange doodles of an alien script on her parchment with her quill. The doodles meant nothing, but were just there to help her feel better as Alden went into graphic detail about having his limbs broken and being taught to worship a single potion bottle, day after day.By the time he got to the part of the merchant Jun had resorted to mindsplit training, having only a portion of her consciousness take the blow. She felt braver handling his story when she was being comforted by two other versions of herself.When Alden was finished, Jun nodded solemnly. \"Well, I'm not gonna pretend I'm excited about looking at meat right now but... I think we could all use a break ya?\" She and Alden seemed to have weathered the tale. But... \"Thaelyn, the recovery part is just as important. There is a second device. After dinner can I interview you too?\"", "1476550171000": "Jun sighed. Again, the interview hadn't bothered her nearly as much as she thought it would. But the details were still hard to listen to. Her initial reaction back at the office was rage. She could only imagine what Thaelyn was feeling.After a few moments Jun decided to follow Thaelyn into the bathroom and, when the opportunity presented itself, put a gentle hand on her shoulders. \"It's gonna be alright. Just remember, this story has a happy ending. And you're part of it.\" She sniffed and wiped her nose on her sleeve as if to signal to Thaelyn that she too was on the verge of tears.\"I think I smell brazed lamb. You know I don't think I've had lamb in a long time!\"", "1476569500000": "\"Uhh ok?!\" Jun says as she is corralled into the sitting room, desperately trying to cobble together a story for the children in her mind. Ok think think think. We knows lots of Land-Tiller stories right? Yah, right! Dad used to tell use stories all the time? ... Why am I having trouble remembering them? I'm blanking. We're blanking. They're starting to sit down. They're starting to sit down. And they are sitting. They are staring at us. Uh, uh...Oh!As she racked her brain, she eventually came across a tale concerning the founding of an ancient kingdom. Supposedly the story was true. She had read it in an old series of scrolls which were a part of Lady Naoki's collection. It wasn't actually a fairy tale, but it was close enough.Uh, well, that's technically a historical legend isn't it? So? We'll just throw in some unicorns or something.A part of her felt less nervous fighting against Alden.\"Uh, ok... Story, story... how about... the Fool who Founded a Republic? Ok, so it goes like this. Uh... once upon a time, in a far off land, there was a man. His name was, Lucius the Fool. He was a very nice man, actually very smart, and he liked to read lots of books. But he didn't like to talk, and he was clumsy, so everyone thought he was stupid. He lived in an ancient kingdom called the Land of Wolves. And this kingdom had a king named Lucius the Superb. But the king was mean, and so were his sons. They used to fight a lot, and Lucius the Superb would send armies to go conquer other kingdoms. The people didn't like them very much.\"Jun paused for a moment and rolled her eyes around her head as if looking for the next portion of the story on the ceiling. Apparently she found it, because she continued. \"Ok, now one day Lucius the Superb was about to go on a great campaign, and he wanted to find out how the battles were going to go. So he sent two advisors to visit a wise old oracle who could see into the future. The two advisors decided to bring Lucius the Fool along so he could carry their stuff. Lucius agreed, because he wanted to see the oracle and stuff. So, they traveled a long way, over big green plains and cold mountain ranges and even a stormy ocean, until they made it to an island. That's where the wise old oracle lived. The oracle looked at them and told them that the campaign would go well at first, but that something terrible would happen and the King would lose his kingdom. She said the next king of the Land of Wolves would be one of them, the man who kissed the world's greatest mother, first.\"Jun smiled at herself as the story came easier and easier. \"Now the advisors were excited. They figured all they had to do was go home and kiss their own mothers, because everyone thinks their own mother is the best mom in the world. Whoever did it first would be king, and the other would be made a great general. They decided they would figure out who would be who later and started to go home, and of course they made Lucius the Fool carry their stuff. But Lucius had another idea. Just before they made it to their boat, Lucius pretended to trip and fall. Splat!\" Jun clapped her hands together horizontally to simulate how Lucius fell. \"The advisors knew he was clumsy so they just waited for him to get up. But as soon as Lucius hit the ground, he kissed the dirt. Because he realized that the earth itself was the mother of all life, and therefore the biggest and best mom in the world. And then all three went home.\"\"Now the advisors told the king that the oracle said everything was going to be ok. And so Lucius the Superb went out and started conquering. At first everything was fine, and his sons, who were military leaders, won a bunch of battles. They came home and started celebrating. They took their armies and partied in the streets, in people's houses, in people's yards. They didn't care about anyone, and the people were unhappy. And then something happened. One of Lucius the Superb's sons went into a lady's house and-\" Oh crap. This part's not appropriate for children I forgot! Uh... it's ok, we can fix it. We can fix it! \"-erm, while the husband wasn't home. And he stole her... umm... favorite unicorn!\" I don't think I've ever heard it be called 'stealing the unicorn' before. Shut up me. \"And he ate the unicorn!\"Leaving the children aghast, Jun continued. \"And one of the first people to find out, was Lucius the Fool. That's when Lucius decided to stop pretending to be stupid. He ran out into the streets and he cried out, 'Everyone! The son of Lucius the Superb has done something terrible! He rape- wrap- reaped reaped Lady Lucy's favorite unicorn, and he ate it! Not only that, but his armies have been mean to our people. They don't share the spoils of war! They treat us like nothing. And the king doesn't care! I say we stand up to the king and make him say he's sorry for treating us so badly!' [Jun actually stood up and did a faux macho voice; she looked silly but hopefully the kids would laugh] And so Lucius the Fool lead everyone to march to the great big castle and start yelling at the king. There were so many people that even the army and Lucius' the Superb's personal guard were afraid to stop them. They didn't like him either by the way. And so after arguing and yelling all night, everyone in the castle decided to get rid of the king, and make Lucius the Fool their new king! \"Now the story gets better because, like I said, Lucius the Fool was a very nice man. He realized he didn't want to be a normal king. Instead he wanted to share power with the rest of the people, and stop any one person from becoming too greedy. And so, he created a special group of people called a parliament, which lets the King share power with people. Rich people, poor people, smart people, and yes even dumb people, would get to say what they thought. And he made the people promise to always stand up to a bad king, and only listen to a good king. And, well, that's the story of how Lucius the Fool beat Lucius the Superb and became king. And so the Land of Wolves lived happily ever after... well, for like 300 years, then another bad king showed up and took everything over again and they had to get rid of him too... Hmm...\" History sucks. \"But, yah, how was that? Was that a good story?\" Jun said wide eyed and expectantly.", "1476597039000": "Jun is relieved the story went over well. She rubs her forehead against her sleeve and takes a bow. She did give little Naoki a little sneer. \"Ya well my version is cuter.\"***When she was escorted to the door, she nodded and grinned. \"Of course. Thank you for agreeing to this.\" She would step outside and turn back to Alden. \"I uh... You know, you're pretty remarkable. You should be proud.\" Unlike with Thaelyn she didn't dare hug Alden this time. Not yet anyways. Instead she just looked into his eyes with an admiring twinkle. After a moment's pause she gestured behind her. \"I should go. Take care High Marshall. Oh! One more thing. After I've trained more, would you ever consider giving me a rematch?\" That twinkle turned into a fiery look. There might even be a hint of luminescence in her eyes.", "1476908077000": "(A few days later)Jun had returned, once again with magical recording devices, some notes, and a quill. She had also brought more candied fruit, and a special treat for both Alden and Juniper, dangling in a little bag.She was wearing a sky blue sundress underneath a black coat. There was a spring in her step. She was about to fulfill a promise she had made a while ago to Alden.Once again she knocked on the door and waited expectantly with a smile.", "1477069885000": "\"Oh dear. I didn't mean to wake you.\" Jun's voice was hushed even though it was too late to not wake up Alden. She tip-toed into the room (again, for no real reason) and deposited all her things on a nearby table, no doubt being swarmed by the kids. \"Same deal as before.\" She said as she opened up the bag of candied fruit. \"One piece now and the rest for later, ok?\"She then held up the second pouch and turned to Alden. \"When we met in the office the other day I said I'd bring you some special seeds for your garden. They are in this pouch. Maybe if we have time today I can show you and Juniper how to take care of them. Aside from that how are you guys feeling? Are you up for another interview?\"", "1477104808000": "\"... This is true.\" She said as she bit into a muffin.***By now Jun had pretty much resolved herself to withstanding the grisly, morbid tale that was the legendary Sun Marshall Alden. Every twenty minutes or so she tried to rotate from one mind to another using her mind-split training, dulling the effects of the gruesome tale every so slightly. But by the time it was over she was emotionally drained.\"... so, the knife went into the brachiocephalic artery, flew out from underneath the clavicular-\" She jotted down the details while muttering in a monotone voice. That's when Alden said that was enough for today. \"-Oh thank god.\" Her head promptly collapsed on the desk. \"You know?\" She raised a finger up. \"I will say this, I've learned more about anatomy and how to kill someone with a clothespin than I ever wanted to know.\"With that said, Jun decided to get up and stretch, and possibly fetch Thaelyn a paper bag to hyperventilate in. \"Yes, good news, good news would be good.\"", "1477203038000": "A gardening lesson was just the sort of thing Jun needed. Of course, this would be no ordinary gardening lesson!Jun took the kids, Alden, and Thaelyn if she would join them, out to their garden, and pulled out the special bag of seeds.A colorful assortment of objects was starting to become the general trend as Jun revealed the contents to the open air. These were special seeds which had been taken from the Va'nei magical flower field, the festival ground which had played host to the Grand Food Festival. These seeds needed to be planted like regular seeds. But unlike regular seeds, they would grow much, much faster, and have some rather unique and interesting properties.She picked some soft loamy soil and dug a little hole with her finger. The hole went down a precise depth, and she picked a blue seed and planted it. She then covered the seed and watered and fertilized it a precise amount. Then she instructed the children to do the same with the others. The various seeds needed slightly different treatments. Some needed to be placed further away from the others, and some needed a bit more water than the others, and some needed to be planted deeper. Jun kept a particularly close eye on Juniper and Little Naoki, half expecting them to be more proficient at their little project.It only took a few minutes before the seeds began to sprout. Yes, of course, they were magic seeds. The various colors represented different resulting flowery blooms. They ranged from a ferocious starburst of red and yellow to drooping, bell-like blues and purples. Every color of the rainbow was represented at least thrice over.The best part was their properties. Some of them were capable of magnifying the flavors of food greatly. Others were medicinal. And some had silly effects like cause people's mouths to glow chromatically when consumed.There was an unfortunate catch. The seeds were very resource heavy. It look a lot of energy to make the plants bloom in such a short amount of time. The soil in which they were used quickly dried and caked, and the blooms themselves were hot to the touch and needed time to cool off before they could be used. Of course, all it would take was some water and extra fertilizer or an infusion of earthworms to restore the soil.Jun then revealed that most of the seeds were actually small, hard rhizomes which could be harvested from the ground to make more seeds. Some of them were legitimate seeds of course, to be produced by the plant if left unattended for a few days inside peculiar fruiting bodies.With all that said and done, Jun decided to take a moment to extol the virtues of perfectly ordinary, non-magical seeds, for they were the progenitors of these magical seeds and the foundation of all life. Generally fruit that took a long time to grow was also much tastier. The sweet dates in the treats she'd brought, for instance, took many years to produce. Magical seeds were the result of the bond between sapient, magically inclined beings and the natural world as it was.The lecture probably went over the children's heads. But that was ok. Jun enjoyed herself. And it was easier than coming up with a story!", "1477284320000": "Jun and the kids would take care of most of the clean-up, so all that was left was to say her good-byes and be off into the sunset.When the children went of, Jun and Thaelyn were left alone in the yard. Now that it was all over, she decided she wanted to have a talk with Thaelyn. The air was starting to turn cold and Jun was very glad she had brought a jacket to cover her flimsy sundress. Gripping it tightly also helped her work up the courage to say what she was gonna say.\"Thaelyn,\" she said cautiously. \"Umm... I just want you to know... you're being very brave, and I really admire you for, well for all of this, and if there's anything I can do to make up for the strain my little project is putting on you...\" She stopped there, not sure what else to add.", "1477286991000": "Jun gave a demure smile as she reciprocated the hug. \"Thank you so much. I'll still make it up to you though. I've already starting researching new stories for the children. There's this really odd one about five sapient ponies and... well, I won't spoil it.\"As they walked back into the house, Jun looked around idly at their storybook home. \"You know, I think I definitely want to have children some day, when I'm done running around and between two kingdoms. I think I'd want, a boy and a girl, and a pet, other than my demon crow. He's not very kid friendly to be honest. Maybe something traditional like a dog or a gecko...\"(Lizards were traditional in the Expanse, prized for their habit of eating roaches.)", "1477365830000": "Jun's face suddenly ran cold when she remembered something.\"I've already been named a godmother actually, by a close friend of mine. I'm not gonna lie, it's fun to talk about, but it's also kinda scary... Although, I heard my grandma had to do my diapers for me because my mom needed time to get used to the poop smell. My dad was gentler than my mom too. I don't think she ever forgave me for not taking up archery instead of magic.\" She chuckled.She stared down at the ground. \"I hope I can at least be as good a mom as you someday. And Alden's a pretty good dad too.\" She grinned. \"You're a lot more mature than I am.\" She gently punched Thaelyn in the shoulder.", "1478565135000": "(A few days later...)Jun had returned one last time. Today was the big day. It was finally time to end the experiment and actually get to hear Alden's story of recovery. How he became a good person despite all the insanity he had been through in his young life.It felt like a special occasion, so she dressed somewhat professionally in her Isranian Black suit. She brought some more dried fruit candy and a few magical paper art toys she bought from a local magic shop. She wasn't sure if she was going to have the energy for story time after this.She knocked on the door. This was it.", "1478943006000": "The interview was the longest one to date. Jun had been taking careful notes the entire time, and tried to track all of Alden's emotional states from beginning to end. Love, forgiveness, and understand were recurring themes, but there was also a sense of diligence and purpose, both from Alden himself and the people who had helped him along the way. Alden likely would never have recovered without help from others, but his own efforts should not be discounted.Going over the logs from the other devices, Jun understood that the trauma never really went away. It wasn't magically healed or excised. The mind was a more complicated thing that the body, and there was no quick fix. But though thoughts of anger and hatred still permeated his soul in various recesses, with constant vigilance Alden was able to keep them in check and cultivate the good in him.By the time it was all over, Jun could only sigh and take a deep breath. It was a few moments before she could speak. \"You know it's amazing that no one else has researched this. All the magic and construction, the farming, alchemy, ecology, and yet we know so little about the sapient mind.\"Jun folded her arms; her facial expression could best be described as disappointment in humanity itself.\"You're one of a kind Alden. I swear, if you were a holy mage of the school of virtues, you would have won the diligence virtue twice over. Hearing your story is an honor. Really. And I hope together we can use to to help a lot of people.\"A closed-lipped smirk curled on her face. \"Permission to hug you, sir?\"", "1479344751000": "Jun's jaw dropped.She darted towards  one of the devices and switched it back on and waved it at Thaelyn with a playful grin, anxiously awaiting her answer. Her exhausted eyes were now sparkling with joy, envy, and anticipation. ", "1479666026000": "Jun gazed upon the happy couple with envy. Kids, marriage, proposal, it all seemed so romantic. Jun thought back to Vaelar and Ma'sum with a slight tear. If only things had been different...She blushed and looked away until they were done lip smacking each other.\"Uh... want me to spend some time with the kids while you two discuss things?\"", "1480189821000": "Jun grinned. \"I'll be right down. Just let me put this stuff in order so I don't forget anything when I leave.\" She allowed the newly engaged couple to go downstairs while she remained in the study a few extra seconds. During those seconds she indeed began to pack things up, the notes, the recording device, the quill. And as she did so she became distracted by thoughts of the two about to be married.She found herself contemplating the fact that Alden, a being so heavily influenced by darkness and despair had somehow become a father figure, a kind and caring man. It was as if light and darkness were malleable and ever changing within a human soul. The whole thing was fascinating. Life was fascinating. People were fascinating.She realized she hadn't made any entries in her own personal diary for a long time. She smirked when she thought about her grandmother's journal and how it contained so many entries about her experiences with light and darkness, and how she came to understand the world through those experiences. For all her magic and training, and the combat, Jun suddenly came to the realization that it was moments like this that Lynx would have been most proud of her granddaughter for observing. Alden and Thaelyn's engagement was a true miracle, and nourishment for the well of knowledge of the soul worth a thousand mastered spells.And best of all, Jun helped facilitate it.Jun shook her head and quickly reminded herself of dinner.***Alden and Thaelyn would be posed the ring question by little Naoki just as Jun slid down the staircase banister. She hopped off the post and skittered towards the two expectantly. \"Yah Thaelyn, what's that pretty ring about?\" She grinned and looked at the curious Naoki.", "1480433327000": "Jun chuckles when she sees the reaction of the children. So they knew the whole time, eh? It pleased her to see Alden have a slight cheeky side to him. No doubt the kids would learn it from him someday.Except Maybe mini Naoki. She seems like she'll be the eternally serious sort. But who knows? \"We should celebrate. How are those cookies coming along Thaelyn?\"", "1480642636000": "\"Come on Thaelyn. I'll go help you plate the cookies. Oh, meanwhile I got something for the kids while we eat.\" Jun disappeared in a bright flash of light, and then reappeared a few seconds later. \"Sometimes I forget I can do that. Here Alden, you guys should have no trouble figuring it out.\"Jun would escort Thaelyn to the kitchen, where with a girlish whisper ask \"How do you feel?\"Meanwhile what Jun had given Alden was a set of paper sheets, with little folding instructions in the form of numbers and arrows. They were simple enough for an adult (and Naoki) to comprehend immediately. The rest would pick it up soon enough. The end result would be various paper models, mostly animals, wagons, and the like. But they were hardly inanimate. Instead they would be enchanted to move around or even fly.", "1503285670000": "...I wonder if his kids will remember me.Jun had been away for a while, training with Va'nei the Earthwarden and helping the Land-Tillers deal with a labor shortage. Since the war with Goraia she'd mostly kept to herself, and her involvement with the Sun Marshalls had been minimal. In fact, most political news had managed to elude her, though she was aware that some upstart new nations had entered the world's fray and that her own people had strayed from public attention.Maybe that was for the best. They had been isolated for so long that this lack of a spotlight would help keep them centered in the old ways. While their xenophilia had brought them treasures, technology, and trade, it had also brought unwanted attention from raiders and large mythical beasts of destruction, as well as various controversies and cultural conflicts. Maybe it was better the Land-Tillers remain a mere Isranian protectorate, for now at least.The brick and mortar of RIverside Dr. looked exactly the same. She was looking for a noble house, the sort of thing only a legendary assassin and Naoki's head body guard could afford.7, 9, 11...As she walked, she noted how weird it was to be walking on solid stone again. She had gotten so used to dirt and grass, and cleaning the chlorophyll off the fringes of her pedestrian grey robes.Ah, here we are.Knock knock knock.Let me see, Naoki Jr, Rawr Rawr Rawr, Juniper, I think I got enough for everyone.She was holding a small sack of dried, candied fruits.", "1503365382000": "\"Hey, hey hey hey personal space, personal space!\" She said chuckling. She had never been swarmed by children before, and while it was a little awkward she decided there were worst ways to be invaded. Must be the feral blood, although regular kids would probably climb on grown-ups like that too if only they could. \"And as a matter fact I did bring candy.\" She quickly made eye contact with Alden and mouthed the words \"Don't worry it's quite healthy.\"Jun the human cat tree waddled over to the couch and deposited the sack onto the coffee table, where the children would find various candied fruits ranging from banana chips to papayas to a few unidentifiable confections. Hopefully these would serve as a decoy to get the tickling masses off of her.Meanwhile, Moonflower would stumble onto a somewhat worn hard cover book entitled A New Era in Human Rights by Jun of the Celadine. Jun looked at it somewhat red-faced and turned to Alden. \"It didn't sell nearly as well as I thought it would, but I managed to get a copy from the library. They say your first book is always terrible.\"The book was of course an attempt to link Alden's horrific past with the drafting of a human rights constitution, and explain why Empress Naoki's policy of international cooperation had the potential to make the world a better place. It had been published months after Jun had completed her series of interviews. Critical reception was mixed, with the most derisive reviews calling it blatant propaganda and an attempt to capitalize on the tale of a torture victim for political gain. On the opposite end were those who praised the author's attempt to inspire social change, but felt she had sabotaged herself with an excessive use of adverbs.Overall it had been completely overshadowed by Rowena Fletcher's latest cookbook.Jun sighed. \"Anyways, I'm sorry I've been so busy lately. I just, I decided to focus on home a bit more this last year. Plus I had found myself a new training partner. Guess it's a bit selfish of me but, you know, old habits.\" She said this while her eyes ran over all the children, the guilt just barely surfacing in her eyes. She also gave a little bemused smirk towards Rawr Rawr. \"What, you're not gonna try to attack me too?\"", "1503370725000": "Jun strained to not blurt out when I was your age I could blow up a barrel with fire magic what do you have to say to that huh huh huh?On the surface however, she took Naoki's criticism well enough. \"I appreciate that Naoki. You might make an excellent teacher someday.\" She smiled warmly and ruffled her hair a bit more firmly than was necessary.As for Alden's question, she answered, \"Well, more than anything I missed you guys, and I certainly owed you all a visit. I figured you all deserved to know I hadn't dropped off the face of the earth.\"She pulled out a handkerchief and started cleaning bits of fruit off the children's mouths.\"Honestly I'd feel bad if I only came to ask for a favor. Knowing me I'd probably visit first, pretend it's just being cordial and then ask for a favor on a second visit a few days later just so I don't seem like a jerk... That's... that's not what I'm doing by the way.\" Jun's eyes shifted slightly as it dawned on how much better than sounded in her head than out loud.\"Would you like a favor?\" She ask. Then her eyes shifted again when she realized that sounded even worse. \"Er I mean, how are you? How have you been? You look well.\"Oi. I really am back.", "1503425920000": "Jun glanced at Naoki's wagging tail. She half expected to be bitten and clawed at, but then remembered that Alden would never allow such a thing. As Juniper and Rawr curled up next to her, she leaned back and, somewhat hesitantly, put her arms on their shoulders. It was causing some confusion in her mind whether or not to treat them as children or felines.An evil grinned curled across Jun's face after Alden spoke. \"Big Naoki, huh?\" She paused as she tried to follow up her statement. The thought of the Empress dealing with children amused her to no end. \"I'm sure the children will have an excellent time with her. And well, Naoki will live. You kids will be good Auntie Naoki while your father's gone, right?\"She then asked Alden, \"What sort of trip? Will you be gone long?\"", "1503435005000": "\"Dangerous...\"Jun's silence is palpable.For next few seconds a rush of flashbacks to the interviews and the horrific testimony speed through her mind like angry, flocking birds.As the children start purring, Jun pets them behind the ears, not consciously but out of reflex.\"Do you think the past is repeating itself? Are you gonna be going alone or will you be taking Sun Marshalls with you?\"Jun suddenly notices she's petting the children behind the airs and withdraws her hands with an embarrassed, muted smirk.", "1503436645000": "Jun breathed a sigh of relief. She was afraid that Alden had found evidence that the so-called training methods that had forged him were still being practiced.\"So it's more a matter of closure. Well that's good. That's great actually. In fact I wouldn't mind lending a hand. If there's one thing I'm good at it's burning things-\" Jun paused, sighed exasperatedly at herself and rolled her eyes. She shook her head and looked back to Alden. \"I'm hopeless.\" She mouthed silently.She looked around quickly to see what the other kids were up to now.", "1503447951000": "Jun was surprised to see children sleeping so soundly when it wasn't bed time. Once again she figured it was the feral blood.No wonder Alden is still sane. That must come in handy.\"So when are you leaving?\" She asked. \"And would you mind if I volunteered?\"", "1503450551000": "\"Hmm, I haven't been in a combat situation in a while. I seem to remember wanting to pay you back for this.\"Jun pulled back some of her hair to reveal a small scar on the side of her widow's peak, where Alden had knocked her out in a duel. His speed and mobility proved too much for her magical prowess.\"I'm not as ornery as I used to be, and my style has changed. I'm trying think more like a traditional sorceress, with a greater emphasis on patience, strategy, and firepower as opposed to rushing into the frontlines. I've come to the conclusion that I don't need to be able to take on absolutely everyone and everything on this green earth to be effective. After all, that's what teamwork is for. Er, that of course, isn't to say I've gotten weaker since we last met.\" She said slyly.\"Anyways, what kind of threats do you anticipate? Booby traps? Anti-magic? Or... some people from your past? If the latter, how do you want them dealt with?\"Current law would suggest something along the lines of a fair trial and humane imprisonment. But in the end that was Alden's choice. There were no obvious answers when it came to this sort of thing.", "1503453271000": "Her scar prickled slightly at the mention of \"another warrior like how I used to be.\" He didn't need to elaborate on why that would be bad. Jun was no slouch when it came to combat and Alden defeated her rather handily, even though she had enough firepower to fight dragons. It was a bit of a rock, paper scissors situation, and the last thing she needed were more enemy scissors out there.\"Maybe we should talk in the kitchen.\" She looked around. She wasn't sure the children should be listening to some of these details. \"I could use a glass of water anyways if you don't mind.\"She would start to get up and head towards the kitchen. Assuming Alden followed, she'd lean against a shelf and fold her arms. \"I hate to say this, but maybe you should consider taking a group of marshals with you. This is more than personal you know? If there's a danger that this man is running around making more super assassins, then this not just about you. It's about the innocent people that he's torturing and turning into weapons. If there's a chance he's there, he cannot be allowed to escape.\"She raised a hand. \"I'm not trying to defy you of course. If you're sure you'd rather rely on a small group of volunteers, I understand.\"", "1503455576000": "Jun gratefully takes the water and takes a sip.\"Very well, although I don't agree with him not being a threat. He kidnaps people, tortures them, and turns them into weapons for sale. He might not be a threat to Isra per se, but he's a threat to human decency. And if I see him, I'm not sure I'll be able to hold back. If he's even remotely as strong as you, I probably shouldn't anyways.\"She sighed and puts the mug down carefully. \"But, it's like you said, there might just be books there. So I'll try not to get worked up.\"The flapping of a large bird would be heard just outside the window.", "1503524262000": "\"Yah, I'd rather face a hoard of assassins than hurt their feelings more than I have to.\" Jun smiled and started to walk back into the living room. \"Oh, do you think you can get me a more detailed report on the ruins and the surrounding terrain before we head there? I'd like to be prepared in case he tries to flee. Also you didn't answer my question about whether he's skilled in anti-magic.\"As they entered the living room, Jun grinned at all the sleeping little faces. \"Aww I hate leaving them so soon...\" She said hushed. She started to gently poke Juniper and Rawr Rawr awake.", "1503526954000": "\"I missed you guys too. I'll try to come back more often, maybe help give magic lessons if some of you are inclined.\" Jun gently ruffled their heads (except Naoki, who had probably had enough) and sat up.\"I think my Midnight Sun telepathy gem still works so, when you're ready contact me and I can be here soon.\" She taps the little gem on her collar and appears to concentrate on a spot on the wall.Alden would hear a sing-song voice. Hello hello hello hello.", "1503528138000": "Jun gives the kids a little salute as she steps out the door. The kids would see a ordinary looking black crow sitting on the balcony of another house across the road on the second floor. Its shiny black eyes peered at them intently. It gave a little caw.\"Take care guys!\" Jun walks off and starts to head down the road. The crow would fly down and join her as she puts her hood up.While the kids were bickering they might sense a brief flash of light like a distant storm through their curtains. If they checked outside they would see that the crow and Jun had vanished.", "1463810771000": "This structure was a recent construction indeed. Jun could still remember flying over Isra on Blackbean and seeing the warehouses looming beneath her. She always used to wonder what those warehouses once stored, if anything, and what secret meetings and mysteries were held within them currently. She kept meaning to visit the district, but it was too late now. Oh well.Jun was wearing a black silk blouse with a floral pattern on it, and black slacks and boots. She walked with a tad more confidence and sophistication now that she had finances and a few political accomplishments under her belt. Her chin was higher, her back was straighter, and the natural cunning of her eyes was less marred by insecurity, however endearing it could be sometimes.She felt... important. And it was a nice feeling.She walked up the stairs and passed the double doors, into the foyer. She nodded, impressed, sensing the magical wards everywhere. In some ways this impressed her more than the actual decor. Of course none of that was as impressive as the Sun Marshals. Some of these beings were quite powerful and intelligent, something she not only sensed but could read in their eyes. It was something she never talked about, but she was very good at spotting people who were as intelligent or more intelligent than her. Call it a gift brought on by years of insecurity and competition, which thankfully her master Lum'Valia helped cure her of... well, mostly.Finally she arrived at the entrance to the main tower, where supposedly Madam Naoki herself resided. A little out of breath, she questioned the guards.\"Uhh, greetings, my name is Jun, of the Land-Tiller's Expanse. I was asked to come here by Lady Naoki herself?\" She still couldn't get used to it. Lady Naoki... Lady Naoki... Didn't quite have the same ring to it as Madame.", "1463855054000": "Jun extended her hand out and shook his had. Immediately she felt more welcome than expected. After the rumors that the Sun Marshals trained their recruits until they either passed or die, could speak four language, and take on ten men in melee combat unarmed, the very phrase \"Nice to meet you\" came as an immense relief.Jun couldn't sense much magic coming from Alden's body per se, but he was covered in some intricately crafted magic runes. Also the man looked like he could shatter a jar of pickles with his forehead should the lid prove uncooperative.\"Nice to meet you too. I've heard things but it's nice to actually have a face to match the rumors.\" She did her best to not looking intimidated.", "1463885255000": "Jun was surprised to receive a Sun Marshall badge. She really wasn't given any details as to why her presence had been requested. She stared at the badge for a few seconds. \"Oh, wow... Ok... I mean, thank you. I appreciate it. I just wasn't expecting to receive a badge like this. I wasn't really told why I was invited.\" She mounted the badge onto her upper chest. \"Umm, reporting for duty, sir?\" She saluted with an awkward grin.\"As for questions, well, no, not really. I mean this organization is still in its fledgling stages so it makes sense that there will be quite a few unprecedented situations. I'll do my best to help as much as I can.\"", "1463945780000": "\"The queen huh? Hmm... I have an idea about that.\"Jun thought for a moment and then nodded and smiled. \"Consider it done. Good to be on board. It was good to meet with you and Takhana. Thank you for the honor to serve with you. Speaking of whom... What's her story? If you don't mind me asking. I know a little about you, but I don't know anything about her.\"", "1464031610000": "Jun blinked when she sensed Takhana's thoughts.\"Oh, wow, that was very brave of you... Huh... Oddly enough I've always wanted to meet a drow. My land is mostly human, though some elves watch over the land as well. And then there are the sodalites, who are... they're human... technically... sorta... well anyways I should get going. It was a pleasure to meet you. I'd shake your hand but... well, you know, telepathy, well actually...\"Jun's actually tries to imprint the thought of handshaking into Takhana's mind.With that done she turned to Alden.\"Well, Takhana answered my question for me. I'm heading out. Wish me luck, sir.\" She saluted again and left the facility.<Exits>", "1475182005000": "\"Seriously?!\"Jun was striking up a conversation with one of the Sun Marshall staff when it was let slip that Alden was dating. \"Who? Er, how?\" She meant no offense, but Alden had always seemed rather mechanical and closed off. Not that he wasn't a friendly person. In fact Jun found him most agreeable, especially when they first met. For some reason Jun had just always assumed that dating was more or less beneath the ultimate assassin.***The next day Jun would appear in Alden's office, holding a lumpy looking brown package. She'd knock on the door to see if the pickle-jar-breaking-capable-forehead man was available.\"Hello, Commander Alden, sir?\"", "1475184934000": "Jun carefully creaked open the door and popped her head in. \"Hello Alden.\" She said with a wave and a devilish grin.She stepped lightly into the office and smirked slightly at the mountain of paperwork that Alden had allowed to pile up, again. It was well known in the organization that Alden hated paperwork. She approached him and carefully held out the package in her arms.\"So, I know this is somewhat irregular, and perhaps even borderline inappropriate, but I heard you were dating someone and, well, in my culture it's not uncommon for young people to give each other presents of well-wishing. So, I got something for you.\" She held up the package.If he were to go ahead and open it, he would find an interesting assortment of colorful flowers, most of which were not native to Isra.\"The yellow one makes a good perfume when boiled. The white ones are cooking ingredients. A lot of times people will share each other's cooking or teach each other how to make things when dating someone, again at least in our culture. So, I just thought that might be useful. Uh, the red one is...\" Jun's face turned red slightly. \"Well it's a tea for uh...\" She strained. \"Er, you'll like it. Just make sure both of you drink it at the same time, in your spare time. The blue one makes a calming tea in case you guys get into arguments, you know, inevitable. Uh... I think that's about it. The smaller ones are just for good luck.\"", "1475186548000": "\"Oh, of course! I didn't even know you had a garden. If I did I would have brought you some seeds and things. How interesting. You don't seem the type.\"Jun wasn't even sure what she meant by that.\"I hope you're not offended by me saying that. I don't know much about you at all, not that I think about it.\" She nervously parted some strands of hair out of her line of sight. Alden intrigued her. He seemed almost like he was from another world. Everything from his runes to his general demeanor was unfamiliar to her, a another mystery waiting to be solved, just like all the other civilizations and people she had encountered. Just getting to know him better would qualify as an adventure to her.", "1475195508000": "Jun chuckled. \"I guess that's true.\" Alden continued to defy expectations in terms of friendliness. \"I'm glad you like the gift. When I get the chance I'll send you some seeds to experiment with.\"Jun uneffusively tapped the tips of her fingers together and looked around the room before continuing. \"Well, uh, if you have any spare time sometime I'd love to hear your story. Mine's probably on file somewhere. You probably know more about me than I do.\"She was suddenly conscious of her habit of gesticulating while speaking and clasped her hands behind her back.", "1475211539000": "He has kids too.Jun really had to try to conceal the fact that she had just been mentally floored. Literally every assumption she had made about him had been completely wrong. Alden wasn't a hard-hearted cold-blooded general-type figure at all. Aside from the fact that he could probably fight 20 people at once using martial arts, he wouldn't have been out of place living in an Isranian suburb surrounded by merchant-class families. She only nodded politely, as if Alden having children was as common knowledge as the sky being blue. \"Right, of course.\"But then his tone shifted. Not appreciate his story? After hearing about how he was a family man with a garden? How bad could his story be?\"Oh. Well, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't curious, by virtue of the fact that you just said that, but... It's fine, you don't have to tell me if you don't want to... I, I guess I should leave you to your paperwork. Uh, take care.\" She started to turn around to leave.", "1475256085000": "\"Oh! Well if you don't mind. Sure, I'd love to hear the story.\" She said slightly agape. She didn't expect to be invited to his home. \"I'll stop by tonight.\"She turned around to leave Alden to his beloved paperwork.<Exit>", "1475444857000": "<A few weeks later>Jun had returned to the Sun Marshall headquarters and once again made way for Alden's office. This time she was in uniform and carrying several books, as well as two unusual magical artifacts. They were shaped like wands, but bigger, and inscribed with various intricate runes. She also had a notebook filled with notes. Finally there was an odd document which, upon closer inspection, was a disclaimer form. Her face was quite grim.She knocked on Alden Marshal 's door.", "1475454021000": "Jun took a deep breath. She was nervous about this, but after days of hesitating, she decided this would be a worthwhile project. \"Well, I have a rather peculiar request I'd like to make.\" She set the items down and laid them out plainly on the table. \"I was doing some research in Isra's library, and I found very little research on the treatment of torture victims. The few books I did find were more concerned with administering torture and the history of torture than the recovery process. I thought for days about whether or not something could be done about this, and I came to a realization. I, and many others, don't know what it's like to experience something like what you've experienced. If more people did understand, I feel that atrocities like what you described would be less likely to happen. At the very least there would be more pressure to weed them out, and maybe more public support for Lady Naoki's human rights proclamation. To that end, I had the agent 'Grandma' of the Black Tower make these...\"She pointed to the two strange devices. \"These devices can be used to record the thoughts and feelings of someone with their consent.\"She bit her lower lip and gave Alden a hesitant look. \"You don't have to give away your identity, but, I think it would be great if more people knew about your story. So with your permission... I'd like to use your story to write about recovery and healing. I wanna write a book about human rights violations. The refugees from Goraia would benefit a great deal more from something like this rather than say, retribution against their government. Justice is important. But I wanna do something more. I wanna help people in a way no one-\" she gestured to the pile of books on Alden's desk \"-to my knowledge at least, has ever done...\"After the inevitable awkward pause Jun would say, \"This is a silly idea isn't it?\"", "1475601532000": "Jun nodded. \"That's the gist of it, yes. Of course it doesn't have to be now, or all in one day. I just wanted to show you the magic devices and make you aware of my idea. Remember, it's not just your story I'm interested in, but the process by which you've been recovering, regaining your identity, learning to have a normal healthy family life. That's the part I think will help people the most.\"Jun leaned closer against the table and, almost whispering, said squeamishly, \"Do you think this is a good idea? Like, the generally concept? I really wanna know you're opinion on the matter.\"", "1508382309000": "Suddenly Lady Naoki's mind would fog up, and she would hear a familiar voice echoing in between her ears that wasn't hers.Oh god my duodenum.Alden's face would briefly flash in her mind's eye. Once again Naoki would hear Jun's voice, but it would seem more distant and not directed at her. Instead, it was directed towards the ghostly Alden.Ugh, thanks.And then there would be darkness and a feeling of foreboding. If Naoki focused hard enough, she could make out the shape of a humanoid monstrosity, some sort of sand creature which towered over the ghostly forms of Jun, Alden, and another woman Naoki might not recognize. There were more voices as well.Alden: New plans?Jun: Well, my first instinct-Unknown: Holy shit.The daydream-like images might have engrossed Naoki further if they weren't suddenly interrupted by one last voice. This one, once again, belonged to Jun. But unlike the others, it was sharper, clearer, and definitely directed straight at Naoki's person.\"TALK LATER!\"With that, the visions would come to a screeching halt. Naoki would also find that her telepathic gem hand been in a state of full glow, and was now fading back into inertness.", "1462465338000": "<Enter from Black Tower>Jun and Blackbean were flying low through the streets of Isra. The pyromancy blasts had attracted her the most, but they seemed to have subsided. Was what was happening over there? Did the perpetrators surrender?That's when she it. There was a strange, winged creature flying over the center of the plaza.\"Shit, bank left!\" Jun cried out to Blackbean. The pair did not fly straight towards the being, but instead circled it. Now only were they hidden behind the buildings, but it was dark, so Jun hoped she wouldn't be immediately visible, between wearing black dragon armor and her crow also being black.She drew her sword, Resonance. Bolts of mana started to surge down her chains and the sword began to glow brightly. The surrounding air might start to feel slightly colder as the residual heat energy from the pyromancy blasts would start to subtly flow towards her. Again, she hoped she would not become visible until she was ready to cast her spells.Of course, if there was a peaceful way out of this... and who was Glavilidon?", "1462493481000": "Jun had circled around to the other side of the plaza. She would have trouble hiding her presence now, her sword was glowing rather violently. However, she did her best to remain hidden behind the buildings and out of the creature's line of sight. She saw that the creature was asking for the Isranian air guard to stand down, something which they apparently had no intention of doing. My god the thing had a set of lungs on it. She winced slightly but didn\u2019t lose her concentration.Wait a sec, where were the pyromancers? And frankly which was the greater threat?It was at this point that Jun felt Naoki's thoughts. \"Ok... I think I have just the thing.\"As the possibility of a peaceful resolution began to evaporate, Jun had the distinct impression that fire was going to be important in the next few moments.  The ruffians from before had used fire and the creature was bathed in a fiery aura. So she ceased charging Resonance (which continued to glow fairly brightly) and, assuming the air guard had the \u201cgod\u201d sufficiently distracted, had Blackbean land in an alleyway flanking the creature, where she could still clearly watch the battle. While in flight energy was already gathering in her off hand. Holding Resonance in her main hand, she\u2019d raise her other hand up in the air.\u201cLahspaan, lomok frin!\u201d Her hand would glow red and the heat that had been gathering around her would start to swirl around her in more concentrated air currents. Blackbean was used to heat (on account of being a demon crow), so he wouldn\u2019t mind. He would stay close and watch her blind spots.  If cast successfully, the effects of a ward would begin to propagate around her, extended several meters and rapidly growing in size and strength.(Resonance is charged 1 turn and does not charge this turn. Instead ward is charging this turn. Its effects begin next turn.)", "1462504641000": "Although Jun was just as gung-ho as everyone else about eliminating threats to Isra, she realized that although the creature was obviously not friendly, it wasn't fighting back.Jun couldn't believe she was about to do this. But again, she reminded herself that she was a holy mage in training.\"BEL NAHL KUN!\"Jun released the energy that had been gathering in Resonance. Two large light constructs shaped like isosceles triangles appeared in a bright flash. They were interlocked, so at first they looked like a large parallelogram floating in the middle of the air. They were placed right in between Glavilidom and the hail of arrows, which would bounce off of them harmlessly.That said, Jun didn't want to give the false impression that she had betrayed her allies, so with but a wave of her hands the constructs would separate and rapidly being circling the being's neck. They were saturated with holy energy and were razor sharp, so if the entity was evil and had any intention of so much as moving, it could expect to be decapitated.If successful, Jun would start to walk out. By this time her heat-absorbing ward would have covered quite a bit of the plaza and could only be growing stronger. Anyone who tried to use fire as an offensive weapon could expect to be struck with a nice healthy concussive blast of hot air enough to shatter bricks a few seconds later.\"HOLD YOUR FIRE! HOLD YOUR FIRE!\" Jun would cry out, and then turn to the creature. \"You know I could have cast those right on top of your head. My name is Jun, and I'm one of Isra's ambassadors. There is, absolutely, positively, no chance of your survival if you try to fight. Stand down and let's talk this out. The Dawn Riders will stand down too.\" (As much as she wanted to add on the words \"I hope\" to that last statement, she refrained from doing so.)Somewhat intimidated by the massive creature, she tacked on an adorable little, \"Please?\"", "1462551886000": "Lum'Valia would find a rather unfortunate and amusing sight.Glavilidom's spell was powerful, but Jun's armor possessed an exhaustible resistance to magic. An aura being cast from her helm prevented the spell from functioning as intended. Jun hadn't been successfully teleported, though the aura would now be gone.In her stead however, \"sitting\" in the chair, was a set of dragon armor and a helm.Jun was now standing there, in the middle of the plaza, in her underwear, a cloth wrapping around her chest and cloth briefs. The spell hadn't completely failed after all.\"... Hi, Master Lummie.\" She said as the pile of armor collapsed in the chair she was supposed to be sitting in. Incidentally her giant crow Blackbean had been successfully teleported and was now standing awkwardly next to the Isranian Dawn Riders and their Griffins. Paralysed with eembarrassment, she whimpered, \"Blackbean... could you...?\" The large crow nodded and began to pluck her bits of armor, one piece at a time, and pass them to Jun, whose expression was a mixture of humiliation, anger, and a desire to leap into the Central Plaza fountain and drown herself. Blackbean occasionally gave little caws of greeting and acknowledgement to his fellow over-sized winged beasts as he continued to hand Jun her armor. Jun proceeded to dress herself one piece at a time, all the while muttering something about how she was done and needed to draw a line in the sand.Her spells continued to remain active, but between maintaining multiple focal points and her public humiliation, Jun wasn't able to teleport the armor back on to her body. When she was nearly done she turned to Lum'Valia. \"Crazy Dragon God, meet Lum'Valia. Lum'Valia, meet crazy dragon god. Some pyromancers attacked Isra earlier and this gentlemen here I believe is trying to negotiate their escape. ALTHOUGH DISROBING AN AMBASSADOR IS NOT THE BEST WAY TO START NEGOTIATIONS!\" She screeched at Glavilidom with curled fists as she started to walk towards the table.(Attla, the Conniving  doesn't have to wait for Naoki or Artemis as of now.)", "1462945020000": "Jun's ward and light constructs continued to float around Glavilidom as she approached the table, fully dressed. She was surprised the creature could keep so calm, even laugh, at such a threat. Though she had to admit in retrospect she'd probably be very amused. After her little ordeal, she was far from hungry and refused to sit down, only making sure she was close enough to be able to speak to the creature comfortably.\"I'm going to assume that wasn't on purpose.\" She said coldly. Then she sighed.\"Aaaaanyways, talking peace is a fair assessment, yes. Lum'Valia was summoned as part of Isra's defense mechanisms against possible threats, in this case, you. I'd also direct your attention to the horizon.\" She gestured towards Isra's skyline behind her.The Black Tower loomed in the distance and was glowing violently. \"That... is not going to feel good when it hits you.\" She placed her hands on her hips. \"What were you and your people thinking?\" She would sound almost sympathetic and motherly at first. \"You must have known this was a bad idea. Literally the best you could hope for as of now is exile from Isra, for both yourself and these pyromancer friends of yours. There's no other option for you. I personally won't accept any bribes or private deals and I can't think of anyone who would. Isra's troops are everywhere, and you're completely surrounded. Thousands of innocent people have been terrorized.\"She folded her arms and her tone became more grave. \"So that's essentially my opening and final offer. You and your people pay restitution for the fear and damage you've caused. Gold, all your weapons, your clothes, magical reagents, I don't care. Whatever you have on you. And then you and all of your pyromancy buddies, under heavy escort, leave, forever. Next time you and anyone identified as one of the pyromancers who rioted tonight are spotted trying to enter Isra's borders, you'll either be either arrested or killed.\"Blackbean cawed in agreement, and Jun petted the top of his head. Jun shrugged. \"That's it. You have half an hour. Any questions? Or would you rather find out what me, the giant magical tower back there, and a six story tall holy dragon's seraphim seal can do when we all attack together?\"Jun raised one of her hands in the air. \"I'll give you 30 seconds to decide, during which time we'll all be happily building up more mana for our attacks.\" The glowing blades surrounding Glavilidom's neck would start to intensify, and the ward around her would also start to glow menacingly. Jun suddenly smirked sardonically. \"Feel free to consult your god... oh, wait you are your god.\"", "1463420171000": "Jun shook her head. \"This has nothing to do with being a god! This has to do with justice and doing the right thing. If these pyromancers are your worshipers, then you have to take some responsibility for their actions! They attacked Isra and Isra WILL round them up. But if you don't accept my offer then their fate will be entirely out of your hands. If you love your followers as any god should, you'll help round them up and take them out of Isra, for their sake.\"Jun's eyes suddenly widened when, via the Midnight Sun's telepathic link, she saw Alden hovering over the body of a seriously injured man, covered in burns and missing a hand.\"At least one of your followers in is dire need of medical attention already. He'll die soon if nothing is done. I implore you, do as I say so we can end this peacefully without further bloodshed. If you say you're a merciful god... then BE a merciful god.\" Although Jun's face was fearless, she was sincere. She only wanted peace in the end. \"... I...I can heal the injured myself if you want.\"", "1464134619000": "Jun sensed the ethereal form of Attla, but frankly she had no idea what was happening. One minute she was talking with Glavilidom, next Glavilidom's form seemed to be becoming unstable. She didn't want to attack with the light constructs because she simply couldn't understand what was happening.She could however sense a banishing spell. Was it being cast by the host? The dragon god seemed like it was starting to come around, but she knew absolutely nothing about Attla.Jun decided to take a chance. One of the light constructs suddenly flew down and, with its flat side, would whack the host's body with enough force to throw him off his feet. The holy light from the construct would hopefully strike Attla even if he was more on the side of a non-corporeal shadow. Hopefully this would interrupt the banishing spell and allow the dragon to continue speaking.", "1464541468000": "Jun was infuriated. What the hell was wrong with these people?! She wanted to negotiate with these people, but nooo... She didn't even care what was going on anymore. She just wanted this situation over with.Taken aback, she sputtered. \"I... the... WHAT?! No one said, I didn't say, what the... ALRIGHT THAT IS IT!\"Jun raised her hand in the air. The energy from the light constructs broke apart into a bunch of brightly glowing fragments, like shards of glass. Her ward concentrated all the energy it had gathered into a shining sphere of fire which appeared above her. With Resonance as the focal point, the fire ball attracted the shards of light, which began to orbit the sphere. The odd structure hummed loudly.\"No one said anything about killing anyone and no one is killing anyone! Isra will take care of what's left of the pyromancers. Just, get out of Isra! Leave! Both you and your host, out!\" She drew her sword back and entered an offensive stance. The floating structure hummed even louder.She whispered to her self. \"Fire Art... Resonant Holy...\"", "1464634900000": "Jun would send a quick telepathic message to Naoki. Don't fire the tower.\"I said, NO ONE IS KILLING ANYONE!\" Jun screeched. Enough was enough. \"Everyone get back!\" As soon as everyone was out of range, she swung her sword down and finished her incantation. \"-Fire ball!\"The fiery sphere glowed violently for a fraction of a second before darting towards the host. The sphere consisted of holy flames, capable of inflicting massive damage towards malevolent beings. The caveat was this particular type of attack wasn't capable of dealing a killing blow (except against certain creatures like undead). It could cause massive physical damage, third degree burns, could even shatter stone walls, but it would always stop short of ending the heartbeat of anyone caught in its area of effect, which in this case was focused on the host and the so-called god. It also had a tendency to \"burn away evil\", a strange sort of psychological effect that allowed the victim to see the truth behind their own intentions and how they were affecting others, without being influenced by their own psychological constructs, deceptions, or foreign negative influences. It was as though the flames would temporarily envelop a person's very soul and let them see reality as it truly was.The blast would crack Glavilidom's banquet table in half and send food flying everywhere. The burst of wind would send anyone too close off their feet. A short flash of light would illuminate the entire plaza, followed by rapidly propagating flames spread forward in a 90 degree cone a dozen meters or so. After that, everything would abruptly go dark and there would be an eerie silence. If it connected, it was extremely likely that Glavilidom and Attla's interactions would cease for the moment. If Attla wanted to consume the powers of a god, he'd have to do it on his own time.Whether it struck or not, there would probably be a nice little impact crater in the middle of the plaza, just behind what was left of the banquet table.", "1464802929000": "With the presence of the Seraphim's seal, Jun took several steps back and gathered up mana for a defensive spell, even though it probably wouldn't be necessary. The Seraphim's Seal was an incredibly powerful spell, arguably the most powerful holy spell in existence. And Lum'Valia was one of the most powerful holy mages in the world. Jun sincerely doubted that any harm could come to anyone as long as the seal was active.Still, it never hurt to be safe.Feeling much more calm and at peace, Jun took her place next to Lum'Valia. She marveled at the presence of the seal. \"Woah... I hope I can cast something like this someday.\"She leaned against Lum'Valia if permitted. God, what a day...As for Glavilidom, at this point there was nothing she could do. The seal prevented any other offensive magic. She still didn't know what was happening, but at least she knew no one would die.", "1464894831000": "Jun breathed a sigh of relief. \"Well... I guess that's over and done with.\" She gazes over the pitiable body of the enervated god, and then looks around at the scene that he had caused. Why? Who were these pyromancers and who was this guy?What a crazy world.Jun tapped her choker and reached out to, well, anyone who could hear her. He's down, but he's still alive. Someone should... take care of him I guess? Her thoughts were somewhat hesitant.\u00a0Ryden Greyiron?\u00a0Empress Naoki? Someone?", "1464937637000": "It just so happened that Jun had, in fact, been given basic lessons in draconic from Fundor, Eater of Sheep,\u00a0a long time ago in Cloud Spear. She also knew some from Lum'Valia  and from her own studies.But as the Dawn Riders brought Attla into custody, what strange spells had Attla, the Conniving   exposed her mind to? What esoteric knowledge did Glavilidom have privy to?\"Uh... yah... sure...\" She said. \"I was glad to help.\" She smiled politely.Once she was done receiving the knowledge, she would leave to brief Lady Naoki on everything that happened.She wasn't above keeping... certain things, to herself, of course, if they were dangerous enough.", "1476912983000": "She stared.The rooftop was drafty, and she was wearing a less than insulating black silk women's suit, an outfit she had grown oh so very fond of over the last few months. And what an adventure it had been, seeing so many places, meeting so many new people, watching herself and her people become stronger and stronger. In many ways Lady Naoki's speech seemed to be the culmination of thousands of events.She started to walk along the edge of the roof to get a better view of Lady Naoki's entourage.She remembered the first time she met Jill. Jun herself was little more than a decent mage with a fetish for power and the wanderlust of youth. Jill was a charming (and possibly psychotic) melee fighter who gave no indication of becoming a traitor, She was also her first teacher... Jun remembered Jarkoopi in that dark cave, her very first dragon encounter. Camilla was her very first employer and friend. She remembered the first time she had been to Isra, meeting the eccentric and lovable Demonlord Maelik, discovering the Black Tower, and being hit on by Madame Naoki back when she was still a sultry madame in a red dress.How did it ever come to this? What happened to the hiking, the crazy hi-jinks, the consensual near-death experiences? How did she reach the point of standing on a lonely rooftop watching her friend commit thousands of lives to their doom? The fact of the matter was, despite her anger towards Lord Zephidel and Goraia, she was psychologically wholly unprepared for war. War. The very word made no sense to her. Her grandmother had fought a war, yes. And she had read about plenty of wars. But for the first time in her life she was about to experience one first hand.Jun's hair flipped and flickered into the sad air. There may as well have been a great chasm in between herself and the cheers and Lady Naoki's booming voice below her. The shaking podium and stand from Naoki's overzealous frame did illicit a little chuckle from her. Jun glared at the pointy eared monster, the single deadliest being in all of the world, with her seductive swishing tail. She thought idly what would happen if she summoned a flaming ball of plasma and just tossed it straight into the podium. What would happen if she just ended the whole story then and there? No doubt Naoki's sudden conflagration would bring a dozen or so Sun Marshalls on her position and bring an end to her lengthy tale as well. All her adventures would disappear in that single act. But then so would a war.No, it wasn't worth it. It would accomplish nothing. The people were already galvanized. Jun would be ousted as a traitor and her entire nation would be put to shame. Luckily it was just an idle thought, no different than a peasant wondering what would happen if he stuck his private member in a garter snake's mouth. An amusing simulation to play in one's mind, but not one any reasonable person would act on.Jun sighed. She loved Lady Naoki like a sister. And she also loved Camilla. And deep down inside she knew this was the right thing to do. She would have to steel herself. No doubt the Elder's Council would remain as neutral as possible, committing troops to border defense and perhaps providing food and medical supplies. But after being a part of the militaristic Phoenix State, the Land-Tillers were done with being compelled to commit troops to other nations. The crisis in Aaedan was one thing. There was no moral quandary to be had there. Undead were killing people and the whole world was threatened. Goraia, despite the rumors, had taken no offensive action against her people, or really against anyone (other than themselves). But Jun was a Sun Marshall, an affiliate of the Black Tower, and Camilla's former Lady in Waiting. She did not have the luxury to be neutral. She had to take a stand, one way or the other.\"Sorry Jill, Sorry Jarkoopi...\" She sighed.After the speech was over, Jun raised her hand. A crow flew onto her shoulder. She walked away from the edge of the rooftop.", "1476915226000": "Jun was startled to see she wasn't alone. She swiveled around and saw the pale vampire. It took her a second to realize why she needed a parasol when the sun actually felt good to her in light of the cold air. \"Oh! Hi Skarlet!\"She thought about the question for a second, silently turning her head back towards Lady Naoki, Ryden, and the crowd.Well I did contemplate killing your mom for a brief second...\"Uh, I mean, Isra just declared war on Goraia so... yah, a little.\"", "1476916387000": "\"Friends? I don't know if they're friends anymore...\" Jun returned to the edge of the rooftop and sat down on the ledge. She shuttered slightly; the stone was cold. Her legs dangled over the open air. She wasn't scared though.\"I don't really know. On the one hand I trust your mom. She's a good person, and she's probably doing this for all the right reasons. But on the other hand, war is never a good thing. War is what happens with people don't care about each other's safety, when they are willing to slaughter each other because their needs and ideals are more important than the beating hearts of others. That's... that's just scary... I do think in the end this is for the best. My people are in love with that human rights declaration. They think it's the beginning of a golden age. I just hope they are right. War seems like a shitty way to start a golden age though. What about you? What do you think?\"Jun couldn't help but grin slightly. It was nice seeing Skarlet out of uniform. She was growing too accustomed to seeing her in bunny ears.", "1476918453000": "\"It must be nice being able to live that long and see the big picture.\" Skarlet's words, despite being cold and logical, did make Jun feel a little better.\"I still don't really know what I'm gonna do. I guess as a holy mage I should be aiming to save as many people as possible. On the other hand... I've definitely got a score to settle with Jill...\" She pumped her fists together, and there was faint red glow in her eyes. But then the energy went right out of her. She hung her head and sighed. \"You know, I like fighting. I like showing off my spells and abilities. I don't actually like killing though. It's too bad the world isn't just a big game, huh?\"", "1476928202000": "Jun patted Skarlet on the shoulder from behind. \"It's not going to happen any time soon, but when it does I'm sure you're gonna be very brave.\" She sat back down to hug her.\"You know who you might wanna meet someday? Va'nei the Earthwarden. She's ten thousand years old and has seen plenty of people live and die, and she still remains a compassionate and benevolent being. You might also want to meet Lum'Valia, my teacher. Not quite as old, but same idea. Heh, that's funny. Someday your best friends are gonna be dragons, since they live longer than anyone.\"After a few moments, she added, \"I'm not particularly afraid of death. Most of my people believe in reincarnation anyways. My biggest fear is what my parents will feel if I die before them.\"...Now they were both sobbing slightly.", "1476929749000": "Jun chuckled. \"You guys should start an immortal club. I've heard some interesting rumors about Grandma...\"Jun suddenly grinned. \"I'll tell you what. If reincarnation is a thing, and I do come back after I die, I'll see if I can find you. I can't promise I'll remember you, but at some point we'll meet up and become friends. Or maybe rivals. Or hell maybe I'll be a short tryst of yours, or even your boyfriend. I've always wondered what it's like to have... you know what, nevermind.\" Jun's arm around Skarlet's shoulders gripped tighter and she rubbed up and down. \"Don't be scared of making friends. Make lots of friends. If they really care about you they'll probably visit you even after their gone, either in spirit form or as reincarnated people. Maybe one day, a thousand years into the future, you'll be one of the most well-liked people in an entire village. And you won't even know why. It'll just be true. And then you'll realize that we're all watching you.\"She winked. \"Maybe that'll help motivate you to be a fair ruler, yah?\"", "1476931812000": "Jun blinked, blinked some more, and just gave the biggest shrug she could muster. It was so much of a shrug that her shoulders threatened to dislocate.\"Well, look on the bright side. At least you have all the time in the world. My lover is unfortunately on mercenary missions all the time. I never get to see him anymore! That's the worst right there.\"Jun looked onward at the crowd. \"This might be the last time we get to have a conversation like this for a while...\"", "1476934583000": "\"Oh yah? Hee.\" Jun parts her hair slightly to reveal a new scar just in front of her left temple. \"I got a new one, fighting the leader of the Sun Marshalls in a duel at Land-Tiller's new arena. I'm weirdly proud of it even though he kicked my butt. But I'll get him next time. I forgot, how did you lose your arm again?\"", "1476937039000": "\"Ah. Sounds fun.\"...\"I don't think I've ever been dismembered before. I should probably avoid that.\"Jun would continue to sit next to Skarlet in silence for the next few minutes, watching the rally unfold. She was an interesting person, and rather sweet, especially for a vampire. At some point she smirked and thought to herself that it was probably for the best that she didn't incinerate Naoki and Greyiron when she had the chance. Otherwise they wouldn't have had this memorable conversation.But alas, Jun realized she had a lot of work to do. As soon as the rally ended, she gave Skarlet one last hug and wished her luck finding a lover before heading off. She needed to intercept someone important and find out just what the heck was about to happen next.<Exit>", "1545782921000": "It started with a subtle breeze, whose gentle strength made the flames of the Yuletide log bow lazily.Then, from the north, a long stripe of color, as long as the horizon itself, materialized. It was a\u00a0long band of stars, like a galaxy's arm, with little glittering forms easing their way through the air towards the revelers. As it came closer, the single band broke apart and spread across the sky. The lights drifted down into the city like snowflakes, their true form brought into focus.They were seeds, maple-like with helicopter wings spinning through the air. Each seed was imbued with a magical luminescence that was easy on the eyes but bright enough illuminate a patch of snow, stone, or earth, depending on where they eventually landed. The seeds were so numerous that they rain down across the entire city. From a distance, it would seem like a great mist of color was blanketing Isra.While the crowd was distracted, a howl and a screech split open the air.\u00a0Quite without warning, Vaelar Black and Jun of the Celadine, each mounted upon their legendary beasts, sailed down through the cloud, and brought with them a remarkable array of charges. They were birds, hundreds of them, following the pair in thick streams. As soon as Boscoe the Manticore and Blackbean the Giant Crow gave their\u00a0respective signals, the birds ignited, giving off golden flames that did not singe a single feather on their tails, but instead brought gentle warmth and comfort to the beholders. As Jun and Vaelar approached the airspace above the log, they split apart and flew in opposite directions, each covering their own half of the city. A thick trail of birds followed the both of them, so that from the distance which the seeds appeared as a mist, the yule log would seem to extend a warm, fiery embrace out to its beloved city.The performance was meant to be a demonstration of both incredible magical prowess and gentle compassion. Jun had coordinated the entire performance with Vaelar's lack of magical ability in mind. The seeds were ordinary seeds, and the birds were ordinary birds. But through Jun's tutelage and power, they were able to work together to bathe Isra in holy light.In a way this was meant to be a metaphor. While Isra was the head of a mighty empire, it was not merely a destructive force. It was a home for people to be safe from the ravages of the overworld.\u00a0At least, that was the idea in Jun's mind.Once the entire city beheld the great contrails of fire, Jun and Vaelar would arc back towards each other, their\u00a0fleet of avian sky painters carving out a massive golden heart only fully appreciable from high above the city.The seeds, meanwhile glided slowly and in such great numbers that the air would be filled with color for many minutes. The seeds, like everything else, would not be burned by the strange golden flames.", "1452909257000": "Unfortunately Jun was rather broke, and wasn't sure if she needed anything. Her armor was perfect-looking and she was still attached to her purple Verri uniform. But then again... she thought about her argument with herself during Lum'Valia's training, and insecurities about her appearance began to stir. Maybe she did need a new outfit. Something sexy and stylish.She looked around curiously. \"Huh, I sense a faint magic in this store...\"", "1453051112000": "\"I'm not much of a fashion expert.\" Jun looked around sadly. \"Though I kinda wish I was. Something tells me holy dragons don't concern themselves with things like attractiveness.\" She took a piece of chocolate while looking at some of the... less modest outfits. \"You know, I think sometimes I dress a little too conserv-\";Suddenly Jun sensed a strange presence in the room. Fundor's training had greatly increased her awareness of ambient magic. Jun looked towards the mannequin in front of the store.\"Uh... Lummie... am I crazy or are we... not alone?\"", "1453228297000": "\"Wait, hang on, I think I found something.\"She had been so fixated on searching for something that would satisfy her that she hadn't really paid attention to the imp's antics. Although once again Maelik's... zeal caught her a little off guard. She shook the feeling off and instead focused on a dress which seemed to be calling to her.\"Huh...\" It was hanging on an inconspicuous hook, a dress among many, but for some reason this dress had a magnetic attraction to her (figuratively, not literally, however amusing that would have been). She felt like it wanted to be purchased.What another mage would look like wearing it.It looked like some sort of sun dress, with short shorts and knee socks and a loose fitting gown. There were also optional sleeves covered in a floral pattern that billowed out towards the bottom. Jun was surprised in that it showed plenty of skin but at the same time didn't seem all that... provocative. It was exactly what she had been searching for, bold, daring, but not crazy.How was she able to find it so quickly? Unless...Jun whispered under her breath. \"Lahspaan, fahmey lu.\"A very faint ward appeared around her, and with it she could feel the magic that permeated the store even more. In fact, it was everywhere! Each individual item had some sort of spell weaved into it, and each spell was unique. The spell was subtle and sophisticated. It was as though each dress had a psionic algorithm which connected itself to a customer. But rather than manipulate the customer, it adapted itself to the customer's desires and somehow modified the article of clothing to best suit their needs. For instance, the dress she was holding had \"read\" her desire to be less prudish and reached out to her knowing it met the criteria. It then manipulated the threads themselves. This dress in particular lent itself easily to enchantment, and was highly compatible with magical energy.At least, that was her theory. There were other elements to the magic that she didn't quite understand. She could have sworn she sensed a faint temporal magic in the air too. If she didn't know any better, she'd guess the dresses were fated to meet with their customers.But that was silly... wasn't it? Huh.\"Hey, Lummie, leave an extra gold coin.\"She decided to take it. She had some ideas about what to do with the dress.\"I'm ready to go... But we really need to meet the owner of this shop someday. They're very... skilled.\"", "1460523939000": "<Time skip after helping Lum'Valia>Now that Jun had returned from her diversion, she decided to follow up on Naoki's offer. The petite girl was dressed in her purple Verri outfit so as to look formal, but unintimidating. At least that was the vibe she was going for. Her weapons were checked in at the door (although Resonance would appear by her side if something went wrong, though it was unlikely).In her mind she wondered what exactly Naoki wanted with her? Did it have something to do with Maelik, or Lum'Valia? Did Naoki have her own plans for Goraia? She brought the file on Goraia just in case.Perhaps Naoki wanted her to join? She did mention she was unfathomably rich...Jun shook her head of these thoughts as she entered the confines of the Moonlight Eclipse. That's when she saw it:At first she raised an eyebrow. \"No that can't be right.\" She walked in closer.\"Is that...?\" Her pace quickened as she continued to approach the painting.At the last stretch, she practically ran up to the painting. \"Calico!?\"Jun's face flushed into a bright red.", "1460525274000": "\"EEK!\" Jun is completely paralyzed when she hears that familiar chirping. A montage of flying feathers and multiple orgasms flashes before her eyes.In a single motion, she swivels to face Calico, her mouth opening and closing like a dying fish as she struggles to find words.\"C-Calico!\" Flapping her hands out once and forcing a friendly smile on her face, she continues to struggle to find the right words. Finally she realizes she is being ridiculous. \"What am I doing?\" She mutters to herself and goes in for a hug. \"I'm sorry. I was just caught off guard. I'm really glad to see a familiar face.\"As they would separate, she would ask a string of questions. \"How've you been? How's the underwater tour business going? How long have you known Madame Naoki? I don't happen to have the equivalent of 20,000 Gauldinian gold in my Carmela bank account do I?\"", "1460530949000": "Jun thought for a moment and started to count the fingers on her hand. He would probably regret asking...\"Uh... well... Let's see. Since I left Carmela I've... returned to Medan, which was traumatizing because one of the towns was destroyed, found out my grandmother had been reanimated by my grandfather who may or may not have been temporarily evil, and that they died killing a giant dragon... so, that was a thing. Then I learned light magic from a holy dragon, bought a tiny cottage in Medan, bought some new armor, almost went insane, helped fix Stonevale after it was attacked by another dragon, learned how to absorb heat energy, speak some draconic, and cast wards from another dragon, umm, I almost died in a volcanic cavern, got reunited with my demon friend, visited a magic boutique, OH I met the twins I don't know if you've met them, they hang out the Midnight Sun, met a holy paladin, climbed a big mountain... umm, almost died again, almost went insane again, visited the celestial realm, almost died again, discovered a superpowerful magic sword, OH I DID FIGHT A DRAGON! Um, lost my demon powers but gained holy powers in exchange, made a new contract with a friendly demon, met a bunch of orcs, um, helped resurrect a spirit ghost child thingy from another dimension, met a time mage, umm...\"At this point Jun turned red again. This part of the story involved Vaelar. \"UMM, MADE A MER- *cough* mercenary friend, fought a bunch of gnolls, got reunited with my mom, OH I SENT A LETTER TO MY FAMILY, like you suggested, umm, found out Medan was taken over by an evil dictator whom I kinda sorta wanna kill, learned some melee fighting, killed a bunch of evil orcs, spend some time in Gauldin-\" Jun was still careful to avoid mentioning that Camilla was alive. Incidentally, she had run out of fingers a lot time ago and had started counting them from the beginning again. \"-Um, visited the Black Tower branch there, met Madam Naoki RANDOMLY-\" Jun had almost forgotten she was keeping two secrets now. \"-helped my holy dragon friend regain her powers... and... yep... yep that's pretty much it. Now I'm here.\"Jun was proud of herself for remembering her entire life story. Then her face turned grave. \"I have no idea why I'm still alive... Hey, can I borrow 20,000 Gauldinian gold from you? If you ever go back to Carmela you can take it from my account.\"As if things couldn't get any weirder, Jun started to blink rapidly and stare at a random spot on the floor as the reality of her insane life style continued to sink in.", "1460572990000": "Jun cocked her head a bit. \"Yah, let's go somewhere and relax while we wait for Naoki.\"She walked over to one of the easy chairs where Calico originally was, and collapsed. She looked like she was about to fall asleep, in an aggravated way. \"Medan is doing terribly. They've got a new dictatorship and some old citizens aren't even being allowed in. I heard the Fletchers actually had to break in through the walls just to get to their house. My people were on the brink of war with them even. So yah, it's a mess.\"Jun curled up into a little fetal ball and tried squish herself into the easy chair. Finding this to be too awkward she laid back again instead.\"It wasn't a real dragon. Some kind of guardian spirit for the new sword I got. Resonance. It's really cool. It's like, alive, and very powerful.\" She yawned. The chairs were comfy.", "1460612232000": "Jun, of course, complied. As the passed through the Alcove and into the hallway, Jun felt special, being privy to the secret innards of such an establishment, or any establishment really. It was like a child's curiosity of what was behind every office door of daddy's workplace, even if ninety percent of the time the answer was either more cubicles or brooms. Upon seeing all the locked doors, another thought occurred to her. The Moonlight Eclipse must serve many more functions than dining or entertainment, functions beyond the scope of public knowledge. Then again, Naoki was the secret leader of a magical paramilitary organization. Who knew what else she was hiding?Finally they arrived at their destination, and immediately Jun felt out of place. Her purple tunic and black slacks were in stark contrast to the overtly feminine charms of Madam Naoki and her bodyguard. \"Ugh, forever a tomboy.\" She muttered to herself, although most likely her words were just barely audible, a realization that brought out a capitulation smile. Without even waiting to be beckoned to sit, she stepped forward and cautiously placed herself on the couch. She then clasped her hands together, and leaned back against the most pearlescent pillow she could find.\"It's good to see you again Madam Naoki. Nice dresses.\"", "1460679825000": "Jun looked around and took in all the cool colors. \"It's relaxing, kind of like I'm underwater, but in a good way.\" Suppressing a slight blush from thinking about Calico, she turned to the two women's dresses. \"I think it also helps you stand out more when you're wearing powerful colors, like red and yellow, am I right? Oh, I'm Jun by the way.\" She extended a hand out to shake Artemis'.\u00a0Suddenly a low rumble emanated from Jun's stomach. Embarrassed, she said, \"I don't suppose we can talk and eat?\"", "1460754110000": "\"Thank you so much.\" Jun unapologetically began slurping up the soup. Half of it was gone in just a few seconds.She stared insecurely at the wine. Unfortunately she was not good with alcohol. After a few moments' hesitation, she went ahead and took a little sip.\"You guys are really kind... Soo... What is it that you need from me?\" Her smirked had a touch of mischief as she deduced the general purpose of the meeting and wanted to get to the point.", "1460785141000": "Jun folded her arms and became pensive. Given how often she portrayed herself as a country bumpkin and a fidgety goofball, her contemplative look was surprisingly severe and still. She was like this for a good minute, at times only moving her eyes like some sort of haunted painting.Suddenly her stance was broken with a slight snigger. \"I've been bitching about the fact that I want 20,000 gold so I can take advanced courses in Gauldin. I could also use an enchanted buckler to compliment what little swordplay I have. That'd be enough to make some sort of contract with me... I could go slay some monster for you or broker a peace between some angry elves and kobolds. But...\"She wanted to carefully word this, so she thought for a few moments. \"My most important adventure thus far has been becoming a holy mage, because it completely changed my perspective on who and what I am. I sought power, jealously, so I could live up to a figure head who in the end, just wanted me to be myself. My self, deep down inside, is a peace maker who only wants to make friends and do the right thing. My fundamental nature is almost child-like in that sense. Naoki, you once told me that you supported the philosophy of one doing whatever they please in defiance of the shortness of life. I shared my love of people's stories and why I consider them sacred. I believe, our philosophies can work well together... What I want are more opportunities to help others. I want more opportunities to broker peace, to protect the innocent, to prevent evil from spreading. I want to pursue THAT story, and live it to its full potential, because that is how I want to spend my brief time on this earth. That is the story I choose in defiance of the futility of life.\"Jun fixed her gaze back at Naoki. \"Do you understand?\"", "1460790529000": "This was a big moment for her. Not since she had first joined Medan and entered Princess Camilla's entourage had she truly felt like a part of something greater.\"... I think we have a deal.\" Jun's tense posture relaxed, and once again she was back to her old self. She reached out to shake Naoki's hand.\"I wonder if your smith is as good as Imud Habrua's. He was a master smith who lived in what used to be Medan. He could masterfully craft dragon parts. He made me a full set of armor and everything... I'd love to know if he was ok.\" Jun sulked and rubbed her face. \"Gah, I'm so mad about Lord Zephidel! I read your report. I'm glad there are survivors and refugees... but the fact that they even exist is just as disheartening. And the anti-siege weapon is even more terrible than I thought...\"It was only at that point that she realized she was standing, and that her heart was beating much faster than normal. \"I... I'm sorry. I didn't mean to spoil our negotiations with my temper. I get very emotional about things some times. You're clearly not that sort so I hope you won't judge me for it.\" She said sheepishly.", "1460794340000": "\"I did. I had a small cottage there, with some personal effects and a garden. My grandmother's original rig was locked away in a chest there. Knowing Goraia, they've probably confiscated it. Luckily I have a new one of superior design but, you know, sentimental reasons.\" She huffed. \"Why do you ask?\"", "1460827355000": "\"Heh, Lummie and Maelik huh? You know they were starting to develop a romance... oh god I probably shouldn't have mentioned that OH HEY!\" More food. Jun gave a slight head bow to the elf and of course dug in.\"You're very generous. Of course I'll accept. Quick travel between the Nokari moutains, Isra, and Gauldin...\"\" She spoke in between mouthfuls, and it was during those mouthfuls that Naoki's offer really sank in. \"Oooh, you know I've never actually properly decorated a home before. My old cottage was just a table, work bench and cot. OH, could I set up my own laboratory and study?\"Suddenly she thought of Vaelar Black. \"Umm... can I bring... romantic guests... over?\"", "1460846586000": "Jun would assume Naoki meant the lab, although Naoki might not be aware that Jun assumed that Naoki meant the lab. \"Sure, if you stay clean and don't put odd things in there.\"After a brief awkward silence, Jun took a sip of the red wine. It tasted like what it was, fermented grape juice. \"I think... we're good, for now. I think we should enjoy the last of our meal while filling out paperwork. As for Isra... it says in your report that the Land-Tillers are beginning to rise as a political power. I'll have to ask my dad about it, but I'm pretty sure I'm still considered a citizen by the tribal council.\"Jun started to drink more of the wine. \"Huh, this stuff's not too bad. *hiccup*\"", "1460870480000": "\"Well, at the time our government wasn't even on the map, so dual citizenship wasn't even an issue. Now that it's over, I prefer to identify with my own people. I'll always be loyal to them. Besides, to my knowledge we are still allies.\" She smiled the whole time. She rather liked being called cute earlier. Also the minuscule bit of wine she had was starting to take affect.Jun was pleased with the delineation of their arrangement. She was especially looking forward to the pay and new shield. Agreeing to the terms, she signed. She was now a member of the Midnight Sun.Jun blushed at the mentioning of Calico. She certainly blushed a lot today. Though she was less embarrassed because of the wine, her faces was redder than usual... because of the wine. \"Ah, well, we umm, to be frank, we had umm, a romantic encounter in Carmela and, well... I... may or may not have... rocked his world... several times... in an hour... *HICCUP!*\"", "1460877802000": "Jun laughed a bit louder than she should have at Calico's lack of stamina. \"HAH, well, to be perfectly honest, sometimes a girl wants a good sprint instead of a boring marathon, know what I'm SAYING?! *HICCUP* UGH, but seriously thouuuugh, Calico is a sweetheart, and he help me start my own *HICCUP* business... y'know? Unffffoortunately it's all the way in Carmella and well...\"There was one thing that Naoki didn't count on. A small subset of the Celadine women had a notorious genetic trait. They could not hold their liquor, at all, period.Before Naoki could complete her advances, she'd notice a distinct lack of reciprocation... then a very soft snoring. Then Jun would unceremoniously slump forward and to the side and rest, spread eagle, on the couch.", "1460918184000": "While this was happening, Resonance was stirring in a small cubbie at the reception desk, its consciousness somewhat impatient in waiting for his master to finish negotiations. Jun's pet crow, Blackbean, was waiting outside, being doted on by unsuspecting passers by and children. They were unaware of its true nature as a demon crow. Jun wanted to bring him inside, but the possible presence of anti-magic fields at the negotiation would have some nasty side effects.", "1460940131000": "Jun suddenly sits up with blinding speed. \"Leaping codswallop that smells! Oh...\" She looks around and sees Calico and Naoki staring down at her form. She rubs her eyes with one hand. \"Sorry, I should have mentioned my lack of an iron stomach. Ugh... *sniff sniff* Oh... wow, nice candles... yah, those are perfect.\" The scent was exceeding relaxing and Jun was tempted to lean back and go to sleep again, but she figured that would be rude. \"Hey Calico, guess what? I'm one of Naoki's associates now!\"", "1460998894000": "Jun's cheeks went from being a tanned rose color to a pearly white in a matter of seconds. Her countenance would be best described as a humorless mannequin with such a deep and profound apathy for life that being manhandled, dismembered and undismembered, groped and undressed while on public display, all meant absolutely nothing to her. Her face was so remarkably still that every single blink, every bat of an eyelash, had the gravity of a guillotine drop.A few seconds later Jun's frozen visage slowly rotated towards Naoki and gazed upon her swiveling tail. Her head cocked slightly and there was a distinct pop in her neck. She took a deep breath, leaned forward slightly, and carefully placed the tips of her fingers together while staring at the table in front of her like it was suddenly the most fascinating table she had ever seen in her life.Meanwhile, within the depths of her consciousness:Jun?No.... Jun?NO!... Jun, we should totally go for it....Jun?... How did I get here? What is this? What is my life? I'm being solicited for sex by a cat girl, and her body guard, and a bird man.... Jun?WHAT?... You have to admit, that's a really cute tail.Back in reality Jun's cement head would swivel slightly and gaze at the tail before returning to the table.Come on they are both really fucking cute! You already had sex with one of them!...You come from a clan of diplomats! You're supposed to be respectful of other cultures! What would father think if you-DON'T BRING MY DAD INTO THIS WHAT THE HELL IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?... All I'm saying, is there is nothing wrong with casual sex.And what about Vaelar? Hmm? HIS culture is monogamous. HE would not want me boinking three animal people.Two.... I'll bet Artemis is hiding, like, a shark fin somewhere, or something.At this point, should anyone attempt to interrupt Jun's inner dialogue, they'd be met by a swift and stern single dainty index finger, pointed straight up in the air, facing right at them, a tacit but no less harsh edict of silence.Oh, hey wassup.What, where did you come from?Hey other me, Jun is about to participate in an orgy.Sweet.NO I'M NOT!... It'll be good life experieeeence. *sing-song voice*Hey, I fought a titan, I have all the life experience I'll ever need.Jun, sweetheart, there is nothing wrong with breaking out of your shell, seeing the world and living life-I FOUGHT A FUCKING TITAN!Although Jun's face still hadn't changed in the last few seconds, assuming there were no anti-magic fields currently active, a small crack would appear in a nearby glass, to which Jun would idly gaze at before returning her attention to this most captivating of tables.Jun, Jun Jun all I'm saying is that you should be more open minded. Non-judgmental... I'll bet Lum'Valia would want you to do it.... I... cannot... even begin... to describe to you... what is wrong with that statement.Look... honestly, if your loyalty to Vaelar is that important, then I think you should follow your heart. Do what you want, or in this case, don't do what you don't want.Really? You mean that? What if it's bad for negotiations?It doesn't matter. You have every right to say no. That is a fact.... Ok, thank you....But, but... that tail though?! Think of the possibilities! The foreplay!...Suddenly, like a dead animal returning to life by means of mild electrical stimulation, Jun's face began to stir. Only a few seconds had elapsed since she had gone cold, and yet her deep sighing breath would imply an effort comparable to an hour-long diatribe about conservative values with a stubborn old man. However, it wasn't quite over yet. \"Madam Naoki, I... I..., would you excuse me for just... one second? Just a quick second... that's all.\"Assuming she were permitted to step outside the door, she would make her trek towards the door. Grave, ponderous strides would bring her past the fancy upholstery, past the gauzy blue fabric of the curtains, past the warm lamp lights, right to the door. She would step outside, close the door half way behind her, and then poke her head, accompanied by a raised index finger, back inside the door. \"Just one second. I promise.\" Finally she completed the action of actually stepping outside the door and closing it.Things would be relatively silent inside Naoki's room. A few more seconds would elapse until muffled, barely audible yelling and shouting would begin just outside.\"No, I'm fucking done. I'm fucking done. This is bullshit. This is, fucking bullshit... WHAT IS THIS?! WHAT IIIS THIIIS? *odd hybrid of laughter and sobbing* WHAT IS MY LIIIIIFE?! I can't do it. I can't! Grandma, I can't fucking do this.\" As if someone had given her words of comfort (though nothing else would be heard), Jun would then continue. \"I appreciate it... But look what we're dealing with here! You gotta draw the line somewhere. YOU GOTTA DRAW A FUCKING LINE IN THE SAND! We gotta make a statement. You gotta look inside yourself and say, 'what am I willing to put up with today?' NOT, FUCKING THIS!\"A few more seconds would go by before Jun once again re-entered the room. Her face seemed oddly serene. Once again, with ponderous footsteps, she walked past the warm lights, past the blue gauze curtain, past the fancy upholstery, and once again took her original place on the couch facing her beloved table.\"Madam Naoki... Calico, umm, well, first of all I think you guys are... amazing people, and... well I love you both. I absolutely am forever grateful at the chance to meeting with you two and, well, I really do look forward to working with you both. But, umm... Welp, I have a boyfriend. I met him recently, his name is Vaelar, and he's a mercenary with a fairy substantial, well-endowed... army of soldiers NOW, I'm not afraid of him. He is a sweetheart and a true gentleman. And, and and you should know this, there is nothing in my culture that forbids, umm, casual...\" Jun rolled her open hands around each other as she struggled to find the right word for what she wanted to say. \"-encounters. But... he, comes... from a monogamous culture and, should I engaged in said venture with you lot, umm, I, well, I... It would hurt his feelings, immensely. And to be frank, although I'm sure this, this would just remain between us I umm, I don't think I can morally justify engaging in this... last bit of our treaty. So umm... I can appreciate that you, are um, that you are very forward, and open minded, and HONEST, those are, um excellent qualities which I cherish in a friend... But, I... will, have to... respectfully, decline your offer.\"Jun pried her eyes away from the venerable table and looked towards Naoki with a guilty smile and glimmering eyes. \"We can still be friends, right?\"", "1461034580000": "Jun gave a polite little nod and got up. She scampered towards the door, but then paused.She quickly turned around, grabbed her plate where some bits of food remained, and re-scampered back outside the door.Right before she closed the door, she poked her head back inside. \"Have fun.\" She smiled.She would leave Naoki alone with Calico and Artemis for a few minutes. Hopefully that would be enough...", "1461097115000": "Jun would be in the main dining hall, relaxing on a couch, listening to some amateur poetry which was actually not bad, if a bit angsty and repetitive.She was nodding off, but still awake.", "1461132379000": "Jun suddenly started. \"W what? Oh, yah of course. Yah I umm, I took care of my own needs after I left the room.\"...\"So, I've noticed you are suspiciously concealing something behind your back? Don't suppose it's a gift for me is it?\"", "1461177568000": "\"You know, this is cool, but I don't think I'll ever get used to this.\" Jun obediently removes her ring and carefully clasps the the choker on her neck. She picks up a nearby mirror and examines it. Frankly it looks rather fetching on her.She taps the choker's gem. She started thinking very hard.Hello? Hello? Naoki? Is this thing on? Testing, one two three. Testing one two three... Huh... ECHO ECHO ECHO!Shadows of her earlier thoughts might come through in the form of white noise.I wonder if Naoki's species affects her libido. How's Resonance doing? I haven't played with its consciousness in a while. If Calico's form is some sort of enchantment, would it transfer over to his children? Would his female children lay eggs? Wait, he was born from a human mother right? My god that beak must have hurt passing through...", "1461190575000": "Jun nodded at each point that Naoki made. She was fascinated by how important Naoki's actual role was in international politics.When she got to the part about the sea monster, Naoki's mind might suddenly be flooded by all sorts of rapid calculations.Her + wrath + harm = guardian + possibly sentient, supported by lore; diplomacy possible option, picking sea routes that minimize ecological damage, offer some sort of service, Naoki's affect on economy to minimize fishing, export Land-Tiller multi-tropic aquaculture to Gauldin and Isra?\u00a0Chance entity isn't sentient and only acting on instinct, may be necessary to try to relocate, capture, or even kill...\u00a0Light construct cage, offensive spell mostly fire, pausibly ineffective against sea creatures, coordinate defenses, electrical magic, use of physical weapons in case of magic resistance, logistics of hiring soldiers, handled by Naoki?Naoki's assumption was correct. Jun was in fact rather intelligent, if perhaps a little unstable. \"Oh, I'm sorry.\" Jun concentrated for a moment. The stream of thoughts in Naoki's mind would cease.When she was done, Jun would finish thinking. \"Ok, well, there are a few ways this could play out. You make it sound like the creature might be intelligent. I might be able to reason with it, if as an ambassador you could meet some of its demands. Guardians of nature are... fussy. They're actually kinda like my homeland in that we care about the balance of nature. So it could be something like, using certain sea routes at certain times of the year and avoiding others, minimizing fishing in certain areas, that sort of thing.However, it's possible the creature is just a big animal acting on instinct. I could help develop magical defenses for your ships, or... well I guess I could try to find it and either relocate it somehow or kill it. I might need some of your resources, various reagents, scroll paper, stuff like that. Is there any military presence on Carmella I could coordinate with just in case?I guess my overall point is I want us to be prepared for anything.\"", "1461205650000": "\"Ok, you have my word.\" Jun gave a little salute. \"Just let me know when the papers are ready and I'll be on my way.\" She yawned. \"I don't suppose I can sleep here tonight? It's been a long day.\"After a brief pause she said, \"By the way, I'm kinda surprised you don't already have loads of sea men at your disposal. I'm sure you'd be a hell of a sea man recruiter. Why I'll bet you could... you know what I'll just stop there. Sometimes it's best to just swallow your pride. You would know right?\" She giggled.", "1461394922000": "Jun appeared rather alarmed at Naoki's use of big words. She knew what the words meant of course, but people tended to pull out their strongest vocabulary when upset.\"No, I think that will be all. You know what? I think I will head over to the Sun. I'd like to requisition a simple but high quality buckler to add to my gear from the smith. And I'll make a list of possible items I'll need to deal with a sea monster. Have the papers sent there.\"Jun got up and headed towards where she was briefed the teleportation room was located. \"Oh, one more thing...\" She reached out and rubbed Naoki's shoulder with firm, yet delicate hands. She leaned in close and, with a concupiscent susurration to accompany her caress\u00a0said, \"You always have Calico.\" She winked before cordially leaving Naoki's presence.", "1461396548000": "Jun, Blackbean, and Resonance were climbing downstairs after disembarking the teleportation pad.CAWK!Jun nodded in agreement at Blackbean. \"Yah, that takes getting used to for sure.\" Shaking her head, Jun and her little entourage asked the staff for directions. They had found someone to requisition the basic items they wanted for their quest to find the sea guardian, but they also wanted to see if the blacksmith have a custom buckler made to match their current weapons and armor. Jun never really thought about it, but she had some of the best equipment in the Overworld. Resonance, the fourth dimensional sword. Dragon scale armor and helm, and a legendary class magical rig. It seemed like a shame to be stuck with a second rate steel shield to go with it.She was told that a new smith had set up shop somewhere close by and went looking for him. Of course, she didn't know it was\u00a0Imud Habrua , yet.", "1512273268000": "She was wearing her favorite formal outfit, one of the first truly formal things she had ever purchased, and in Isra no less. It was a black silk suit and slacks, with a floral pattern running down the side of her top. She walked in a bit gingerly, looking around at the both familiar and alien decor. The silver doorknobs, the tapestries, the paintings, they all still seemed a bit excessive after having spent a year training in the wilderness. It was odd. She didn't recall feeling this blind-sighted when she went to see Alden, or when she visited the Enclave.Lady Naoki's face was a welcoming one, and she felt she could use a friend. Although the last few days had its ups and its perks, the mission in the forested keep still weighed heavily on her mind. She waved her funny little hand wave and made her way over, careful not to bump into anyone.When she slid her butt into the booth, the first thing she said was, \"Do they still serve Darkdew Chocolate Cake?\"", "1512363889000": "\"... I'll... just have coffee to drink.\" Jun said slightly red-faced. Her intolerance for alcohol was legendary by now. \"Oh! You know what? I'll take a Dynamite Sandwich to boot, if that's alright.\" She turned to Lady Naoki. \"I'm hungrier than I thought.\"Actually, getting to sit down in a luxurious restaurant, far removed from the horrors of the forested keep, and in gracious company, were all contributing to a steady return to happiness, which correlated with an improved appetite. \"It's nice to meet you.\" She said to the waiter. Then she chuckled lightly, wondering why she had chosen to say that to the waiter. Perhaps a subconscious attempt at flirtiness?When he was done taking their orders, Jun folded arms on the table and looked at a spot on the table just in front of Naoki. She wore a demure sort of half smile. \"I'm sorry I've been indisposed the last couple of days. I'm sure by now you've heard of Alden's mission and how it relates to his past. I found the whole experience rather... well, I just needed time to rest afterward. I did have a bit of a diversion with a new apprentice. Very interesting fellow. I think teaching him helped restore my sanity somewhat. Heh.\"Jun's insides seem to warm up enough to where she could lean back comfortably in the booth. She looked around a bit. \"It feels good to be back in a place like this.\" Indeed, all the aesthetic excess was becoming increasingly appreciated.", "1512510507000": "\"Well, we don't call it Yuletide, but we do like to have a sort of, mellow Winter Festival period. For about a week we all pitch in crops from different parts of the expanse into one big feast for everyone. We serve all kinds of warm, meaty and starchy dishes, and spicy dishes. We also use earth magic to prepare festival houses, with fire magic to keep it warm, and there people play games and sing songs and stuff. It's an option for people who don't want to stay hunkered down in their own cabins or towers, or for the Acacia Tribe who don't feel like making igloos. They prefer to live in tents in the fields, so they have some trouble in the winter time. Oh, oh, there are some clans that specialize in winter season farming, so you'll see competitions for growing the biggest winter peas or fire cabbages.\"Jun smiled as all the fond memories started to flow into her heart. \"Yah, I remember my grandmother use to make these dancing fire elementals like deer and stuff. They would dance through the air and everything. Oh, there was a board game I used to love playing with my friends when I was little. It's kind of like chess, with these little elemental pieces.\"Jun suddenly frowned as she was confused by something. \"Uh, you know what? Oddly enough, we don't give gifts. I mean, as a people we give gifts, like during weddings and the making of contracts, oh and birthdays. But not during the winter festival. Huh... Wait, do I need to get gifts for everyone?!\"", "1512624596000": "Jun nodded politely at the waiter and admired the fine porcelain of the coffee cup. It almost seemed like a shame to use it as a drinking apparatus. But the coffee smells too good to pass up. She takes a sip. \"Mmm... Oh, I could definitely see you spoiling the kids rotten. Actually, if any family deserves gifts it's Alden's. I think I'll follow suit. I wanna get something for Alden himself, too. I just hope he'll accept it without feeling too much guilt. You know how he can be sometimes.\"Jun tried not to let the details of their previous mission infect her happy place.\"Hmm, there are a few things from the expanse I'd like to get them. And maybe you too if you don't mind. It's supposed to be a secret what we're getting though, right?\"Jun gazed slightly jealously at the Red Blizzard. \"Neat.\" She said with a jealous, demure smirk and a single point of the pinky finger of the very hand she used to sip coffee with, which she did right afterwards to remind herself that her drink was perfectly adequate.", "1512800364000": "Jun smirked. \"My coffee just tastes like coffee. It's very good coffee though. My compliments.\" She toasts back and takes another sip.\"Mmmmm, yah.\" The cup clinked lightly as she set the cup down. \"I think I'll be visiting your friend then. Thank you for letting me know about him. I haven't been to the Eclipse in a long time, actually...\" There was a slight pause as Jun looked off to the side while fiddling with the coffee cup handle.She cleared her throat.\"Anyways, you said the Yuletide Festival was a revived old tradition. That sounds exciting. What kinds of things do you have planned? Any games? Special food? Do you...\" She raised a single finger from the hand which held the cup handle and swirled it around. The steam given off by her coffee coalesced into a visible swirling cloud in between them.\"-need a bit of magical help?\"", "1512887430000": "\"Ah, yes, the big log.\"Of course, Jun had seen the big log. Who hasn't seen the big log? Oddly, Jun's time spent learning druidic magic with the Earthwarden had given her an odd sort of sympathy with the log. But it wasn't enough to interfere with the conversation.Poor log.But Jun's invitation to bring some of her culture into Isra was more than enough to put that out of her mind. \"Oh! Absolutely. In fact I could have the Land-Tillers set up shop all over Isra. They'd be happy too. They could also bring some of those giant winter peas, although the fire cabbages are a bit of an acquired taste... maybe shouldn't bring those. As for light show, I mean I'm no chromomancer but I think I could put something together. Fireworks are easy for me. I think I can make giant snowflakes using light constructs. Oh, but I can't make more than three or four at a time, but I can make then really really big. I can probably make magical plants that glow in the dark. Oh oh oh, if I had some assistance, I could probably fill most of the city with sparkles. I wonder if I can get my dad to help me with fire elementals-\"Jun suddenly paused and chuckled, a little embarrassed. \"You're gonna have to keep me focused unless you want me to go crazy. But, long story short, I'd be happy to help.\"", "1514151252000": "\"Has it really already been a few years? Wow. Time sure flies. Yes, I do remember. Though I recall being busy with something at thr time, can't remember what. Hmm... Was I in Aozora? Or that place with the winged people? Uh... Hmm... I suppose it doesn't matter.\"Jun took another sip of her coffee.\"Maybe it's the coffee talking but that sounds excellent. And lord knows Isra could always use more opportunities to scout out some talent.\" To which she added with bitter muttering, \"Never know when some nation destroying psychopathic super soldier who tortures children is going to come along and try to pick a fight.\"She shook her head. \"But yes, I'd love to participate. When are you planning to hold the next tournament?\"", "1514626356000": "Jun's jaw drops.\"Thaaaank yoooou.\" She whispered to the waiter. \"I needed this... I needed this more than I realized... I'm actually a little turned on right now. Also can I get some more coffee?\" She asked the waiter. At the same time she took a cake knife and started slicing sizable wedges for both herself and Lady Naoki.After she was done, she stared at her slice greedily. \"I should eat the sandwich first. Better for digestion.\"After taking a bite of the Dynamite, she decided it was more than alright.\"So who else were you planning on, er, exhibitioning?\"", "1476936114000": "After finishing up her chat with Skarlet, Jun decided she needed to face the reality of the situation head on. She figured Lady Naoki would be heading for the Citadel soon and she had every intention of meeting her there. She was flying atop Blackbean; from there she could see the reaction to Naoki's speech propagating among the populace. They were mixed to say the least.That's when she saw a familiar head of silvery white hair bobbing below her among the people. \"Arya?\" She said to herself.There was a bright flash of blue light. Jun would appear right next to Arya in her black silk suit. \"Arya?! Is that you?!\" She was somewhat elated to meet another familiar face. \"Are you headed for the Citadel too?\"Blackblean shrank down to standard crow size and fluttered down onto Jun's shoulder.", "1476941168000": "Jun accepted the hug all too readily. She needed a friend now more than ever, although she didn't really appreciate being smothered by holy paladin cleavage. \"I know right! It's good to see you! As a matter of fact, I was headed to the Citadel too, just to figure out what was Isra's plans are... You want to start a neutral corps of healers, huh?\"Jun bit her lip.\"Do you... need some help?\" Jun was going to mention that she wasn't sure if she was going to be able to stay neutral. But then she decided not too. It occurred to her that Arya didn't have any attachments to Camilla, which meant she didn't have anything personal against Goraia. Arya was a fellow student of Lum'Valia's, a holy warrior. Jun felt ashamed that she felt compelled to take a side, when compared to Arya here. What kind of holy mage was she, to put Isranian lives over Goraian lives?Joining Arya would help absolve her of her decision, at least at first. The very existence of a neutral healing corp might serve as an example to Goraia and help shorten the war. But deep down inside she knew it was only a matter of time before she would be forced to ensure that Isra won the war.\"I can heal too you know, and I'll bet I can get the support of the Land-Tillers. I'm pretty sure they're going to be neutral during the war too.\"", "1477008622000": "Jun had followed Arya along and suddenly remembered she too had one of those psionic comm dealies from Empress Naoki. She tapped the choker.\u00a0Er, what she said... Not that I know exactly what she said but I'm assume I'm in general concordance with whatever it is she said... Hi.Jun also made a point to wave at the guards. \"Hi.\"", "1493401603000": "High up in the sky, a certain giant crow with a certain mage riding it observed the convoy as it left. She had been instructed to follow, and serve as insurance against the enemy's potential duplicity.They would get Arya alive one way or another.", "1519419107000": "The Empress' Eye wasn't Jun's favorite name for a scrying facility. It elicited a sensation of living in a quasi-dystopian police state, if such a concept could be intellectually manifested in their world. Jun constantly struggled to make peace with Isra's power and vast magical resources. It was a basic fact that Naoki had the power, and had every right to leverage it for what she considered to be the greater good. She tried to think of it as a bluff, an imperial motiff that kept citizens in line. Naoki wasn't exactly interested in spying on people doing their laundry or eating pastries...Right?As she and Keph approached the structure, she doubted very much that any of this was weighing on Keph's mind. He was probably more concerned with meeting the mysterious \"Grandma\" and listening to her speculations on what Rara was and how to work with him. Keph was an assertive sort, even more so after her training him in dark magic. She didn't expect him to take Grandma's word as law, but she hoped he would at least give her a chance and not be too offended by a stranger's consultation.\"So... how was dinner the other night?\" She asked with a smile. She was wearing nondescript pale blue robes and once again was accompanied by Blackbean, who was sitting on her shoulder.", "1503614848000": "It was a bizarre happenstance that Jun had never actually visited the Enclave before. The renowned gathering place of all of Isra's great mages should have drawn her like a magnet. But it seemed like she just never had the time, or was too busy training under specific masters, or nearly getting herself killed.But that was all about to change, all thanks to Blackbean.\"Yah, it's just like walking a dog. They need to get out and stretch once in a while.\" Dressed in plain grey robes, Jun was informing some nearby wizards and witches why she was allowing a crow the size of a horse to fly circles around the Enclave like some ominous herald of misfortune. \"No, he doesn't eat people. He likes mutton and whole stripped chickens. Yes, he's from the demon realm, but he's a permanent resident in this world thanks to a friend of mine. I think he's at least 50 years old. No, he doesn't eat people stop asking me that.\"I probably should have picked a better place to do this.", "1503617448000": "Jun swivels around, looks back at the crowd and then points at herself. \"Me. Oh.\" She doesn't hesitate to take his hand, figuring that the Enclave was not the safest place to attack or kidnap her.Likewise she senses an immense amount of power coming from the tall, floating enigma. She doesn't act alarmed, but smiles politeiy.\"Huh, I feel like we've met before, but I can't remember where. But I take it your someone important. It's my first time here. I was taking my uh, 'dog' out for a walk.\" She points up at the large crow just as it casts its silhouette over the pair. The creature sees the strange person and starts alter its flight path so that it is will start circling them instead.", "1503619476000": "\"I see. That's-\"Uh oh.Jun backed up slightly. She started to remember where she had heard of Vigil.\"Vigil, I have an odd question for you. Have you had any desire to, oh I dunno, go on a murderous rampage or... actually, here's a better question. Have you undergone a binding ritual recently?\"She recalled her adventure in the Ethereal Realm, where she had met his father. He told her that Vigil had been taken away from home and needed to undergo a special ritual in order to be a fully functional, non-rampaging adult.", "1503623992000": "Jun grinned pridefully. \"Well, you mentioned earlier few people have been to the ethereal realm before, and even fewer had made it back alive. It just so happens I'm one of the few. Your father was concerned about you and wanted me to convince you to go home in case I ever saw you. But I guess that's no longer necessary. Wow, you're all grown up now.\" She looked Vigil up and down.\"If you don't mind me asking, how have you been keeping tabs on me? Aside from occasional trips to Isra I've been rather reclusive. Is it just word of mouth or should I look around more carefully the next time I bathe?\"", "1503631483000": "\"Oh, yes, I remember Levi... You know his death still kinda hurts. Strange as it sounds I'm still not that used to seeing people die. I shouldn't be so concerned about it. I've actually seen a glimpse of heaven once. Long story.\" She chuckled. \"Well, I suppose one should never get used to death exactly. Fear of death, not just yourself but of your teammates, is the best motivator to strive for excellence in battle. Or so I've always speculated.\"Jun quickly checks up on the crow, who seems to have gone back to orbiting the tower.\"So, you were the archmage for a while. Are your, uh, species all gifted in magic? I was rather ornery and... uh-\" Jun remembered the substance that Zaltos had given her to help her relax during their sojourn into the Realm. It was of a very recreational nature.\"Well, let's just say I didn't have a mind to ask the right questions when I was in the Ether Realm. I was too busy trying to see straight and not laugh uncontrollably at bacon.\" Somehow she said this with a straight face. \"But there's supposed to be some kind of connection between the magic of this world and the magic of yours, right?\"", "1503637924000": "\"Right, I remember now. There are areas where it isn't safe to use large amounts of magic. Sure, I wouldn't mind knowing where it is, or how to sense more of them.\"Blackbean was starting to descend towards them. It seemed it was almost done with his \"walk.\"\"So, if you don't mind me asking... just how strong are you anyways?\" She asked with a grin. It was obvious that she was feeling a little competitive.", "1503680170000": "\"The Black Tower. Oooh, yah.\" Jun grimaced. \"You must mean Grandma. I've met her too. Yah, I wouldn't go messing with that. Well, I wouldn't mind a friendly spar. I haven't really fought anyone in almost a year so, I hope you don't mind if I'm a little rusty. I have however been training. I've also made some upgrades to my equipment.\"Jun closed her eyes and flicked out her wrists. There would be a bright flash of blue light, followed by her body being encased in something like liquid sky, swirling and pulsating about. A second later, the substance would disappear, and the grey-robed Jun would be gone.In her place was a petite, but formidable looking warrior. She was wearing not plate armor, but rather what looked like a heavy, pine colored silk suit. There were many layers of cloth, each several millimeters thick. Covering her torso, shoulders, and thighs were a lamellar style brigandine, pauldrons, and tassets which seemed to be made of emerald dragon scales. Covering Jun's head was a brass-like barbuta helmet with a Y-shaped opening. Finally, Jun had acquired a brass-looking buckler with a sapphire sphere in the middle, and a chrome blue looking short sword.Her hair was completely concealed by a dark green coif, and the bulky armor concealed her feminine form, so at first it would be hard to tell that this was the same person, except-\"Achoo!\"Jun's sneeze sounded distinctly like a small female's. When she sneezed there was a faint jangling, like chains, that seemed to come from her flared out sleeves.\"-Snort- Sorry. This might sound weird but, this armor still has some pollen in it. Long story. -Snort-\" Her voice sounded a bit muffled underneath the helmet.The large black crow meanwhile fluttered down to the grown to meet the pair. The enclave observers would finally see how large the creature was. Blackbean cocked his head slightly so that a single, vast black eye peered at Vigil's head. ", "1503693368000": "Jun hobbled along in her very warm armor until they made it to the safe chamber. She decided to have Blackbean shrink down to his regular form and wait outside while she and Vigil both measured each of their non-existent sexual members.\"I agree to those terms. Good luck.\" She took a defensive stance with her buckler held forward in her left hand, knees bent, left foot forward and right hand wavering her sword in anticipation.Not a second would go by before Vigil would suddenly feel a massive pull of both life and heat energy from all around the room towards a single point of light about a meter above her head. If Vigil could sense energy he would also sense the room's life force intermingling with her own mana pool, like thin streams flowing from her body upwards. The light was rapidly becoming brighter and brighter.", "1503697738000": "Vigil's attack was well-timed. Had it come a second later Jun would have had enough energy for something quite nasty. As it was the staff would connect against either her brigandine or helmet. It wouldn't do much damage, but it'd annoy and distract her. She'd stumble forward and then turn sideways to try to keep both the portal and Vigil in view. The light would start to expand like a glowing white balloon, but its luminosity would decrease as she lost focus on it.", "1503700042000": "\"Believe me, you definitely slowed me down. But not for long!\" As she said this the balloon of light would suddenly shift positions and leap onto her body like a second suit of armor. Something was beginning to take shape around her, a silhouette made of light. She kept her defensive stance in case Vigil was able to fire something off before her spell was complete, but with the spare energy from her failed attack it wouldn't take very long to cast. She kept an eye on both the portal and Vigil as she muttered a short three syllable phrase.", "1503702680000": "Jun braces herself to accept the magical missiles with her buckler, purposely delaying her spell by a fraction of a second so that when it completes the final product is at full health.There's a loud clang as the missiles strike the sun metal buckler. Jun's arm is thrust painfully against her chest, wrenching her shoulder. She slides back and seems like she's going to fall over, but during a flash of light she's able to extend her other \"hand\" to the ground to steady herself.Except it wasn't quite her hand that touched the ground. Instead it was a great, glowing hand of quartz with crystalline stones for phalanges. She was now encased inside a large translucent creature. Her body, in a fetal position, is just barely visible inside a great shimmering white sphere. The creature's body is humanoid, and its arms and legs appear to be large elongated glowing boulders. The creature doesn't have a head. It is a light construct, an extension of Jun's will that is also protecting her.Its body vibrates, causing it to emit a screech not unlike nails scratching a blackboard. After its battle-cry it starts to rush towards Vigil. Its footstep are thunks like stone on marble, but rather than act heavy the creature is surprisingly fast.", "1503782635000": "The creature's reaction to Vigil's flank is immediate. It swivels around one of its massive arms, expecting to collide with Vigil. Instead it would strike against his battlestaff, and like two heavy, powerful objects colliding, they would likely send each other stumbling apart with a sound like a great marble block splitting in two. The creature would quickly regain its balance and assume a defensive stance.During the collision, tiny flecks of light would spray out from the battlestaff's point of impact, and a small crack would form on the creature's arm. The crack would slowly reseal if left unchecked.", "1503857759000": "Oooh crap crap crap crap crap-Jun realizes she's in trouble the moment the orb passes through the first pillar. She instantly recognizes that this attack would be difficult to dodge and inflict damage on her if she didn't.The only way to deal with it that she sees is to sacrifice her construct.As quickly as they can, the limbs of the construct detach themselves from the main body, leaving its torso floating like a great white ping pong ball ball. There's a dull thud as the limbs all swivel to the back and strike the torso from the rear, sending it sliding forward but diagonally, just grazing Vigil's attack. The limbs would disappear as they are struck by Vigil's orb.As Jun slid along the side of the pillar area, the torso of the former guardian would start to fade away, and Jun's silhouette would become increasingly visible. It would be apparent that she was holding up her buckler, which was emitting a bright blue light.", "1503867667000": "As the light faded, Jun was holding up her shield above her head. The bright blue light was coming from a small glowing sphere, which was being cast from the gem in the buckler.\"You're a lot more mobile than I thought you'd be.\"Suddenly the sphere of light exploded into what looked like a sea urchin of dark metallic blue. The odd structure's spines gradually became lighter blue and more transparent towards the tips. It hovered and rotated over Jun menacingly.Then there would be a rushing sound, like intense wind or a waterfall, as the \"spines\" elongated by a factor of ten, then thirty, then a hundred. As they stretched out they would become clear and transparent, like glass. They would also curve away from Jun and spread out all over their corner of the battlefield. They would whip and flail about, and some of them would head towards Vigil. Jun's immediate vicinity would start to seem foggy, and the ground around her feet would become increasingly wet. It was water, and lots of it.", "1503934671000": "As soon as the water tendrils struck Vigil they would wrap around his body and attempt to lift him up. Then they would slam him on the ground, onto platforms, nearby pillars, and anything else that would let them inflict damage.The remaining tendrils would move to intercept the floating particles. But these particles seemed to be able to pass right through matter, so the tendrils would do nothing.Once again Jun had to figure out a creative way to escape. She closed her eyes and focused. Instead of trying to block the orbs, the water would rush back towards her and grab her by the arms and legs. Then it would raise her up into the air and away from the particles.Doing so would cause the tendrils grabbing Vigil to weaken their grip.", "1504025926000": "Thanks to her tendrils, Jun was able to dodge the initial blast easily. But then the portal activated and she was sucked in, then spit out, then sucked in, then spit out again. The source of the water tendrils was also sucked in and spit out and danced and swiveled around her as they both fell through the same space over and over again..\"You have got to be kidding me what the heck is this bull- oh god I'm going to be sick- *gurgle gurgle*\"Finally Jun was able to stabilize herself by having her water source expand in diameter. It took on the shape of a giant water bubble with short, stubbly water tentacles sprouting out of it. The water stopped up the portal like clay clogging a sink. Jun herself had been submerged into the bubble for a second but quickly floated to the top (the water was programmed to protect her and would not allow her to drown in it). She looked up at the ceiling for a moment, distracted by the appearance of her own body floating above her in water.This was easily the weirdest, and one of the most creative attacks, she had ever fell victim to.Red-faced, nauseous, and annoyed, Jun reached into one of her armor pockets and pulled out a little brown bag. The bag contained lots and lots of seeds. Some of the water, along with streams of Jun's mana, began to flow into the seeds, and the bag was surrounded by a neon green spherical aura.Some water tendrils would try to attack Vigil, but with Jun so distracted they would be much weaker and easier to avoid, no more dangerous than debilitated snakes flopping around.", "1504029521000": "Jun continued to float in her giant bean bag chair made of water. She noticed that the top portal no longer showed her image. This caused her some concern. She realized she needed to hurry. Then she heard Vigil's warning, and just couldn't help grin.\"Funny...\"The bag of seeds erupted into dozens of small vines. They tore apart the sack and started to flail around like the water tendrils. Some of them dipped into the water and started to rapidly absorb it. And some start to wrap themselves around Jun's armor. Underneath her helmet Jun's eyes also started to glow neon green.\"I was going to say the same thing.\"", "1504146771000": "\"Druidic Art: Avatar of Life!\"The air shifted in a manner similar to when Jun first created a ball of light. The arena grew colder and all the ambient mana would come rushing towards her body. Just as Vigil came down on top of her, Jun's armor, which now resembled something like a throbbing green leaf pile, twisted towards it. One of Jun's arms stretched unnaturally and would grasp the base of his staff. As she turned, she revealed that the back of her armor was bursting with roots and flowering plants, and the leaves and petals glowed violently with life force energy. She would grip the battle staff with insane strength. Meanwhile the flowers would rise up and turn towards Vigil, emitting nightmarish, shrieking sounds.And then it would all stop.As quickly as the spectacle began, everything would seem to fall apart. The water bubble would explode outward like a burst above ground swimming pool, and Jun would hit the floor with a thud. The vines and flowers would start to shrivel up and die, leaving behind ordinary looking cloth armor. Her buckler would hit the ground with a clatter. She'd quickly reach up to grab her helmet and pull it off, revealing her face to be pale and her hair soaking wet. She started coughing.\"... I give! I give I give I give.\" She coughed some more.", "1504149002000": "Jun gladly accepts his hand. She catches her breath. \"Yah, you too. Good fight.\" After a few seconds she smiled.\"I ran out of power. That last spell requires not just a lot of mana, but lots of ambient energy. This arena, beautiful as it is, doesn't have enough. It's gotta be somewhere outdoors, somewhere with lots of life, like grass or trees, or even the ocean. Since there wasn't enough life energy here, it ended up sucking me dry.\"Indeed, Vigil would notice that Jun had lost a lot of magical power, though it was slowly starting to recover.She snapped her fingers and pointed at his staff. \"That portal thing is very cool.\"", "1504222275000": "\"Nah... you caught me off guard with that double portal trick. If you had attacked me a little sooner, you might have won either way... well, might have.\" Jun smirked. Despite being trained to be humble, she couldn't help but add a qualifier to that statement. After all this time, she still hated losing.When Vigil changes and returns, he finds Jun wearing plain grey robes, and a regular sized crow sitting on her shoulder, eating a bit of bacon.\"Sure. I plan on visiting this place more often. It's wonderful... Oh, before I forget, who is the current archmage of Isra if it isn't you?\"", "1504294583000": "\"Heh... I appreciate that.\" She extended her hand in friendship. \"You seem like a good person. That's the other thing the world will need more of. It was a pleasure to meet you. Say hi to your father for me.\"As Jun waved him off, she decided to get one last good look at the Enclave before heading back to Isra. She realized how lucky she was to be living in a world of such overwhelming mystery. Where else could you go take your magic crow for a walk and then get into a magical spar with a 7 foot tall energy alien from another dimension? Something about this was very motivating.As she walked away with Blackbean on her shoulder, she wore a satisfied smile. Losing didn't bother her nearly as much as it would have 2 years ago.", "1511911506000": "\"Wrrah.\"\"Wrrah.\"...\"Wrrah.\"\"Wrrah.\"Exhausted and drained, Jun was lying down horizontally on one of the stone steps leading up to the great tower. She kept to the shadows, not wanting to interact with anyone but at the same time still feeling the need to be surrounded by her fellow mages. She was dressed in plain grey robes, for although the day was reasonably temperate, she still felt cold.\"Wrrah.\"\"Wrrah.\"Her giant crow, Blackbean, was in his full form, watching over her sympathetically, like a great, feathery sentinel. He was trying to cheer her up, periodically nuzzling her head with his massive beak.\"Wrrah.\"\"Wrrah.\"Every time he let out a probing caw, she cawed back. The act was amusing them both somewhat, and some of the nearby mages were touched enough to smirk, smile, or outright giggle at them. With each caw she felt a little bit better, as if their little ritual was keeping her sense of humor on life support.\"Wrrah.\"\"Wrrah.\"She cracked a weak smile.", "1511916155000": "Jun had been staring at an inchworm walking along in front of her nose when she heard some poor chap struggling up the steps. It suddenly occurred to her that there were two kinds of magically oriented people in this world: adventurers who got plenty of exercise, and recluses who stayed indoors reading books. There really wasn't much of a between. She lifted up her head just enough so she could turn it to the figure who had poked her, where she got an eye-full of obvious-fact-stating.Ironically this was something of a relief, as at the moment she would rather interact with a book than a human. Sadly, there was, in fact, a human behind the book that she needed to interact with.She groaned and sat up, her eyes lazy and unfocused as if she had just woken up. Meanwhile, Blackbean (its name was Blackbean) hopped back slightly to give her oxygen.\"So... do I talk with the journal or the person behind it? I know that probably came out sarcastically but I'm asking sincerely. You get all kinds here. Ever fight a crystal energy being wrapped in bandages before? It's fun but nauseating.\" She yawned and stretched. \"...Sorry, what were we talking about?\"", "1511918995000": "Her eyes followed the tip of his finger. A part of her was tempted to snap at him (literally bite his finger), but the young man had innocent, child-like eyes and she couldn't help play along, bobbing her head in the opposite direction he poked and then slowly bobbing it back into place. Jun the bobble-head doll eyed the journal again, somewhat lamenting the first impression she was giving him. She started speculating the boy had some sort of anxiety disorder, and the journal was an avatar for him to voice his thoughts without speaking.She sighed. \"No, she's just very tired. She got back from a difficult mission which, well it could have gone better.\"She gave another heavy sigh, slapped her knees, and forced herself to stand up. Then she extended a hand out for him to shake. \"Her name is Jun, Jun of the Celadine Clan but you can just call her Jun. And this is her friend, Blackbean.\" She pointed her opposite thumb up at the giant crow, who examined Keph with one big black beady eye at a time, as crows sometimes do. \"What can she do for you?\" She asked with a soft smile.", "1511920986000": "She sighed and stared blankly back, then reached out a finger and poked his forehead back while grinning mischievously. \"Maybe a little bit.\"It was then that Jun noticed something odd about the boy (besides the obvious). She could usually sense if a person was highly proficient in magic, or if she was in the presence of a powerful, magically inclined being. At the moment, this was not the case (something she would resist the urge to say out loud). But there was a very faint something in him that she normally associated with powerful beings. What was it? It was a presence whose relationship with the natural energies of the earth was both strained and respected, a relationship with a sort of foreign ambassador, something that didn't belong-Jun suddenly realized she had been staring at him suspiciously for a good six seconds. Oops.\"Uh, sorry, but do you happen to know someone who goes by Xel'rath, or a very powerful sorceress who goes by the nickname, Grandma?\"", "1511928100000": "Jun had retracted her finger just in time. She smirked and thought to herself, Huh, guess we have a little in common. This was right before she stared at him suspiciously.She squinted to read the new letters. \"Hmm.\" Her mouth squirmed. \"I do. And unfortunately, that's not the last of the odd questions. Umm, how do I asked this without being rude?\" She scratched her head. \"Are you... or are you in any way affiliated with... something, something not from this realm? Something dark and spooky maybe? Like, maybe something that likes to eat matter out of existence or hide in shadows... Hmm, maybe a drawing would help.\"Jun backed up and slightly and bowed her head slightly as a little \"excuse me\". She raised her hand lazily to the side, which apparently triggered a crackle and a snap, along with a flash of lightning. (Blackbean did not react to this and chose this time to start preening.)\u00a0Next to her on the step appeared a traveler's sack filled with scrolls of parchment paper. She sat down next to the sack, pulled out a roll and an ink and quill, and started drawing.Her artistic skills with a quill and ink were nothing to be proud of.When she was done, she held up the scroll to both Keph and the journal. \"Something like this?\"", "1511974737000": "\"Rara, eh?\"Jun could feel herself wanting to take a strong academic interest in void creatures. They seemed to come in all shapes and sizes. Xel'rath was a frightening spectral sort, and Grandma was an aristocratic, well-mannered old woman. (On a side note, Jun had always wondered if they were related, if perhaps Xel'rath was the larval stage of whatever the hell Grandma was, and if perhaps she was his mother or something. But she never dared ask.) And now there was Rara, the ink blob.She looked over the boy again. He seemed healthy, not suffering from any ill effects of the ink-blob (minus the possible psychological ones; after all, he seemed to think her drawing was actually quite good!). Then again she wasn't a doctor, and her magical sense could only tell her so much. At the very least, she knew Rara and Keph were two separate beings. So that was progress.She gave a tight-lipped smirk and rolled up the scroll (the ink dried almost instantly). Then her smirk broke into a grin and she handed the scroll to him. \"Keepsake... So anyways, what's your relationship with Rara? Is it your friend? Enemy? Are you working with it? Do you want to remove it? Is it symbiotic? Is it a parasite? I assume that's why you've come to the Enclave, to get some kind of help with it.\"", "1512013176000": "A salacious little grin curled on Jun's face.\"I don't mean to be forward but...\" Her eyes batted flirtatiously. \"Would you mind giving me a demonstration of what you and Rara can do?\" She put a hand on her hip and raised her opposite hand's index finger up in the air. A little flame appeared on top of it. \"Maybe a duel?\"Blackbean's beak moved forward and pecked the flame out, giving Jun a face-full of neck feathers. \"Ack, stop stop stop I'm not on fire this time.\"", "1512017120000": "Once Jun got the feathers out of her face, she immediately noticed the hesitation in Keph. She suddenly felt a little guilty, and it showed with an apologetic expression. Why had she been so eager to duel a child? Perhaps it was the stress getting to her from that mission...While rubbing Blackbean's feathers just behind the neck, in that one spot that birds can't reach, she explained, \"Oh, well, if you want, it doesn't have to be a serious confrontation. We can treat it more like an examination, where I give you some spells to deal with. Or we could do something a bit more creative, like play a game. But for that, I need a better idea of what you and Rara can do. Of course, out of fairness, I'll tell you what I can do too.\" She smiled warmly. \"So what will it be?\"", "1512020434000": "\"OH! OKAY! UH!\" Jun backed up and looked around frantically. There was also a loud caw as Blackbean hopped next to Jun and extended his wings, making himself appear bigger.Perhaps she should have mentioned that she intended for the demonstration to take place in a sort of training room within the Enclave!To any nearby mages who suddenly beheld the creature, Jun would turn to them and yell, \"It's ok! Don't panic! It's a friend of mine!\"Although her initial reaction was fright, she quickly calmed down and started to examine the bizarre beast, its inky blackness, its bizarre ocular structure, the way it seemed to feed on the magic around it. Yes, she could sense a pull, but it wasn't a malicious pull. The creature didn't angrily hoard the magic around it. Instead, the pull was slow and steady, almost like a feeding animal. The entity seemed to need ambient magical energy in order to sustain itself. By extension, this meant that the creature wasn't as adapted to living in this realm as the other two void entities she had met, Xel'rath (who only ate things when it felt like it) and Grandma (who could actually produce magic on par with the greatest of sorceresses). Perhaps this creature, as far as void creatures go, was relatively young? A sort of void child? Maybe even an infant? Is that why it was willing to form a genuine friendship with a young boy from another realm?She assessed and hypothesized all this this quickly while taking a step to the side, tilting her head to get a better look at the entity from a different angle. Her hands were raised reassuringly.\"So, you're Rara... Hi. My name is Jun... I'm not gonna hurt you... Although I'll kindly ask that you don't hurt me either. Heh.\"", "1512024081000": "Jun maintained a calm, appeasing tone. \"Ok, ok, I see. You want to go there. Umm, ok, but I need you to do me a favor. Hold on.\" Jun reached into her bag of scrolls once again and pulled out another scroll. This scroll contained a very complex, concentric sigil which was far more skillfully executed than the crude drawing she had made earlier. Rara would sense a vast source of magical energy in that scroll. She rolled it out on the stone step and, with her quill, started writing some sort of rune formula around it.If Rara got a little too excited and lunged forward, Jun would throw her hand up at it and say \"Wait! Wait now!\" with the tone of a stern parent.\"Ok, if I try to bring you into the Enclave, some people might get scared, especially if they feel you sucking the magic out of everything. So I'm gonna give you a little something to chew on.\"Jun took something else from her pack, a small pouch of seeds. She took some of the seeds and placed them in various spots around the glyph. Their exact purpose was a mystery. But the seeds seem to cling to the paper as if by static.\"Ok, done.\" She put her ink and quill away and held the scroll up in the air in front of Rara. Then she let go. Oddly, the scroll didn't fall to the ground. Instead, it hovered in the air. Rara would now sense a thin, but steady, stream of magic being released into the air. \"You can feed on that for now,\" Jun said warmly, feeling like she had just prepared a bottle of warm milk for a babe.\"Ok, follow me. And uh...\" Jun looked around at all the tentacles. \"Try not to knock anything over.\" Jun would start walking up the steps, looking back at the void entity to see if it followed. The scroll floated just between then, the glyph glowing a soft blue and the seeds still clinging on.As for Blackbean, he sensed that they were going into a place with doors, and so his form shrunk down to that of a regular crow, which fluttered over to Jun's shoulder and sat. He sat backwards though, so he could continue watching the void creature, which he'd need time to get used to.", "1512093937000": "As Jun led the strange creature into the Enclave, she felt very much like she was visiting a library with a large dog in tow, something you generally weren't supposed to do.And in a lot of ways, this was precisely what she was doing as they passed through the great doors and gained a view of the rotunda. Jun hoped the floating scroll she had given Rara was enough to distract him from the massive amounts of magical energy it would be surrounded by, mostly in the form of dozens of mages walking back and forth between the various hallways. In addition to the mages (who came in all shapes, sizes, and races, though mostly human), there were many, many bookshelves spread out along the outer edge of the rotunda in rows, with random intervals to walk through.Before they could actually enter said rotunda, Jun showed her Sun Marshall badge to the guards at the gate.\"...\"\"I know. I'm its chaperone. It's something of a dignitary. It won't be in our realm for too long, I promise. I take full responsibility for him.\"\"...\"\"Don't stare. Its kind considers that very rude.\"\"...\"When they finally entered the rotunda, Jun looked around, excited. \"I don't come here often enough. This place is actually very interesting.\" Blackbean squawked in agreement. \"This room is filled with magical books, mostly reference materials and such. There are also some apparatus to help with magic studies. Below us are Isra's archives. Most of the tower above is filled with magical rooms for research, experimentation, and training. We should probably take the semi-magic elevators. I don't like stairs any more than Keph does and you might make the teleporting platforms malfunction.\" Jun lead them through a straight path between some of the bookshelves, where Rara would get a better look at some of the objects. Indeed, it wasn't just books, but scrolls, strange crystals, glyphs carved in stone, and about a dozen other types of fascinating, esoteric things. \"You can't see it from here, but sections of these bookshelves form a sort of maze. If you can sense magic it's much easier to navigate. An ordinary person might get stuck for a few minutes though. I think it's a sort of security feature.\" At the end of the path was a doorway with a brass covering, that led to a very tiny room lined with glyphs. The room was just small enough for Jun and Rara to fit in (along with a very confused and frightened little witch who magically disappeared inside her hat upon seeing the creature). \"She'll come out eventually. Anyways...\" She seemed to look up at nowhere in particular. \"Training Room B please.\"The brass gate closed, and the floor they were on lurched as they started moving up further into the tower. Their front view was mostly filled with stone, but periodically opened up into a hallways with various wizards and witches walking about. Finally they came to the last hallway, where they were released. The hallway had various labeled rooms. The mages walking up and down here were far more intimidating looking than the others; many of them had complex looking armor and adorned ornate staffs.\"Hat lady will be fine. Come on.\" Jun would lead them down the hallway, nodding politely to the mages who made eye contact. The mages nodded back and did not seem interested in crossing the two (Jun had a reputation among them). They stopped at Training Room B. She opened the door.\"Welp, here we are. Feel free to float around a bit.\" The room was large, about the size of a basketball court. The lower half of the walls, as well as the floors, were padded with a bouncy white material, like a gym. The lighting from various crystals on the upper walls had a strong purple hue. Near the entrance was a variety of complex looking glyphs which glowed a brilliant blue. Rara would sense there was magic everywhere, but of a subtle kind.", "1512099893000": "\"Alright big guy. So let's see... So, I wasn't clear on what exactly you can do. So how about this? I'll give you some tasks, and we'll see what you make of them. And don't feel bad if you can't do any of them. The fact that you're a giant blob monster that eats magic is kind of impressive enough as it is.\"Jun stretched out her hand to the glyphs behind her. They light up a brilliant blue. Arcane energy swirled into the room, forming pools of energy all around them. When the energy faded away, there were several objects scattered about on the padded floor.\"A burning log. Try to put the flames out without touching them. A small stone pillar. Try to shatter it without using physical strength. A bucket of water. Take the water out without touching the bucket. A broken vase. Try to fix it in less than five seconds. A healthy flower. Kill the flower without touching it. A dying flower. Try to make it healthy again. A thin wire. Burn it, but without fire.\"Jun smirked. \"Not to be competitive but, I can do all of them. Hehe.\"", "1512105590000": "Jun's jaw dropped as the creature unleashed the Eldritch beam of doom. The beam did indeed cut into the wall, revealing a layer of glowing rock underneath the padding. But interestingly, the padding began to regenerate, bubbling up like milk before solidifying once again.When Rara was done, Jun looked back at the glowing eye, slightly unnerved. \"That... was... SO COOL!\" Jun jumped up and down like a gitty school girl. \"And I mean, echem, you know, five out of seven ain't bad.\" She grinned. \"And I mean, that definitely gives me an idea of what you can do. Oh, here, I did say I was gonna show you what I can do.\"Jun once again raised her hands towards the glyphs behind her, and the same objects appeared once again, as if they had never been vaporized.\"It's not as entertaining as your method but...\" First she raised her hand towards the bucket of water. The water started to levitate out of the bucket as an amorphous, clear mass. She released it over the fiery log, which was doused with a hiss. Then, with a flick of her wrist, the stone pillar simply shattered on its own. Her hand sparked and crackled, and the wire too started to crackle and spark until it glowed a bright orange. A few seconds later it gave a brilliant white flash and turned to ashes. She faced her palm towards the vase. \"Vokrii.\" She said. The vase came together in a flash of light, good as new. She then raised her palm towards the healthy flower. An odd sort of green ether flowed out of it, and then entered the dying flower. The healthy flower dried up into a husk, and the dying flower's leaves and petals gained the same brilliant hues as the previous flower.\"Just so you don't lose respect for me.\" She winked. \"I wanna try one more thing. Can you fire that beam again? Uh, raise one tentacle up for yes, two for no. If you can I'd like to see how strong it is with a special target. If not, I'd like to talk to Keph again.\"", "1512109702000": "Jun grinned. \"Alright tough guy. Let's see if you can crack this.\"She raised her both her hands in the air. Her hands emanated a great glow of light. At the other end of the training room began to materialize something big. It started with a matrix of light bars, clearly outlining a flat, octahedral gem. It was at least ten meters tall and wide, and about five meters thick. As Jun continued to pour light magic into it, the structure filled itself with an ethereal light. The more light she poured into it, the more defined the structure became until finally it resembled a solid, quartz rock with a bright, clean white glow. The object hummed violently, as did Jun's aura. It was clear she was beginning to show some of her true power!\"Give it everything you've got. I promise you won't hurt my feelings if you can break it. But that's a big if.\" She gestured her hand, towards it, welcoming her to take a crack at it.", "1512161131000": "Jun would be lying if she said she didn't take some pride in her spell's ability to deflect the beam. But then the creature started eating the octohedron.\"Uh, should I be stopping this?\"Rara barely made a dent.\"I don't know if I should be stopping this.\"Rara actually makes a dent and starts to grow bigger.\"I feel like I should be stopping this.\"Rara is halfway done and is the size of a large elephant.\"I probably should have stopped this.\"Rara finishes eating the spell and is now the size of a small dragon.Jun stood staring for a few seconds, expecting a loud burping sound. When the burp didn't come, she stepped forward to get a better look at the creature from the side. I'm beginning to think this thing isn't an infant.She put her hands on her hips. \"Well, now there's that too... Keph won't mind that you put on some weight, will he? Where is he anyway? Can I talk to him?\"", "1512183114000": "\"Guess that takes a lot out of you, huh?\" Jun grimaced sympathetically. She reached into her bag and pulled out a flask of water for Keph to drink. \"It's just water.\" She added. Blackbean landed on Keph's shoulder.\"Where did you go exactly? Are you possessed by Rara or do you two swap places? Because, I dunno. I might be able to figure out a way to make the transition easier on you.\"", "1512189799000": "\"Hmm...\"Jun sat down next to Keph. She stared at the end of the wall, thinking.\"This is tricky... I've never seen an ability quite like yours. Hmm...\"Jun slapped her knees. \"Story time.\" She said enthusiastically. \"I used to know how to access a different dimension. It was a dimension kinda like the void but... different. There were creatures there that, arguably, didn't belong in this world. It was a very nasty realm, with some mostly nasty, but a few pleasant, creatures. About a year and a half ago, I made an important decision to shy away from those powers and follow a different path.\"Jun turned to Keph. \"Don't misunderstand me. I'm not saying your friendship with Rara is wrong, by no means. Actually, that crow on your shoulder isn't an ordinary crow. He's from that realm I was telling you about. He was a friend I couldn't bear part with from that realm, and he felt the same way. So I enlisted the help of a... a friend, to allow him to stay here.\"Jun turned back to the wall. \"Magic exists on a spectrum, with certain energies more closely related to each other. For example, water and ice, fire and lightning, earth and water to druid, and so on. There's a type of magical energy that is closely related to that dimension I was talking about. And I suspect that you could benefit from learning about this sort of energy, because it might help you better understand the creatures from that world. I still know quite a bit about it even though I don't use it as much anymore. Actually, I tend to favor the magic at the very opposite of the spectrum. Still...\"She turned back to Keph. \"Would you be willing to learn about dark magic from me?\"", "1512196264000": "Jun would have treated Keph's stomach pain with a bit of light magic before proceeding to have their conversation. But it wouldn't have changed the flow of conversation much either way, other than reinforcing the notion that swapping planes of existance was taking a toll on his body, and that her offer of tutelage was definitely a good move.Then came the hug, which of course Jun reciprocated. \"Uh, aww, alright. I can do hugs.\"When they let go, Jun also said, \"I can try to teach you about light magic too. It might improve your vitality a bit and help you deal with with the strain. What are you doing the rest of today? Or would you like to put off your lessons for another time?\"", "1512263108000": "\"Alright. Then the first thing we shall do... is get something to eat. I haven't eaten all day and it looks like you could use a meal. We can talk along the way.\"Jun got up, and then extended a hand to help up Keph too. If he agreed she would lead him out of the room and back into the hallway. As they walked towards the elevator, Jun started putting her thoughts together.\"So, I think the most important thing to remember about dark magic, is that it isn't evil. It has a lot of users that are evil, but it isn't evil in and of itself. Hold on.\"They approached the brass covering. Jun slid it open and had them enter the room. \"Culinary research room, please.\" The brass cover slid back into place, and once again they began moving. \"So... this part's a little complicated. You see, light and dark energy resonate with certain feelings and psychological states. All elements do. Darkness isn't about evil, or even malicious thoughts. It has more to do with your connection to your internal self. Introversion, introspection, self-centeredness, selfishness. These are things that are natural to everyone, and aren't evil. They're just a part of life. Light energy is more extroverted, more closely related to your connection to the outside world, to other people and other things.\"The elevator stopped, and the gate opened. Here was another hallway with more casual mages and sorcerers. The people here had an easy vibe to them. They wore less armor, used simpler staves, and weren't as stern looking. Many of them were gathered around one particular room. There were too many tall people for Keph to get a clear view inside yet, but there was a warm, pleasant spell emanated from this room. \"You'll like it here. But it's a bit of a line. Anyways, darkness is closely related a person's sense of identity, a person's uniqueness. And it's that same sense of self that drives people to find and befriend things that are, well, different, like Rara or Blackbean. It's what makes you want to be a non-comformist, you could say, to reject the natural order of things. And like I said, these are natural feelings that everyone experiences to a point. That's why learning some degree of dark magic might, I dunno... lubricate your passage into the void, for lack of a better descriptive term.\"", "1512269527000": "Jun's face turned slightly red. \"Yah yah I could have said that better.\" She said with a sigh.When the room finally opened up, it was revealed to be a hybrid cafeteria and magical laboratory. There were lots of varnished wooden tables and benches spread throughout the large room. Many of these had a pit in the middle with a glowing purple light, giving off arcane energy. Over the top of these pits were metal grills upon which the local mages had placed various magical implements. These ranged from mundane but shiny looking pots and pans to bizarre tanks and large beakers filled with an unknown liquid.Jun led Keph past most of these and straight to the back, where there was a long table filled with bizarre, but (mostly) delicious, looking plates of food. A very conspicuous sign hovered over the top. It said \"Successful Experiments: Safe to Eat!\" It appeared this was where most of the mages in line were headed, although a few brave souls walked over to the experimental tables to see what wonders and horrors were being produced.\"Try these if you want something sweet. They were made using fruit grown in my tribe.\" She pointed to a platter stacked with colorful cubes. These cubes were mostly translucent. Some of them glowed, and some had swirling, opaque patterns within them, like a lava lamp. No two looked alike; they were all as unique as an expensive marble collection.\"Or maybe this if you want something healthier.\" She pointed to a rather mundane looking platter of what looked like pickled, chopped up cabbage, carrots, onions, and other vegetables, next to some pork cubes.\"I haven't tried those yet. Those look interesting.\" All there was to this last platter was a pile of black, porous-looking balls. They looked like they could either be some sort of dry cookie or perhaps black pumice stone. They didn't very look edible at all.", "1512277458000": "Jun, for her part, took a bit out of all three trays. When she saw what Keph had taken, she went wide-eyed. \"I've... definitely never seen that before.\"This was odd considering it looked like a perfectly ordinary hamburger. Perhaps Jun could sense something that Keph couldn't?She led Keph to an experiment free table so they could sit down and talk once again. The first thing she took a bite of was the bits of pork and pickled cabbage. \"Mmmm...\"Then she inexplicably started chuckling while staring off at nowhere in particular. \"Oh my god that's so cute!\" There was was nothing cute where she was looking. \"Echem, sorry.\" She turned back to Keph.\"Anyways, The first thing we should do is figure out your affinity, if you have one, towards any of the elements. If it's dark, then the next steps will be easier. If it's something else, we'll have to build our way there. The hardest is if your affinity is light, but it's still doable. After that it's a lot of meditating, some exercises, and a few... well, some interesting tasks. You could call them games, I suppose. But, generally speaking, you have to learn to look within yourself and explore your deepest emotions and desires, your inner world, and then resonate that tendency with the energy around you. I think our end goal should be to get you be able to surround yourself with a dark aura, just enough to help you slip into the void, and back out.\"Jun next took a bite out of the colorful cubes. She seemed distracted for a moment. \"What is this? Huh... Do I know what this...\" She shook her head again. \"Sorry. Anyways, there's an added bonus. Doing this sort of training might help you talk to Rara more easily.\"Assuming Keph had started eating his hamburger, this is about where his circulatory system would appear through his skin in brilliant, rainbow colors. His eyes would also glow, the colors ebbing and flowing through the spectrum of known colors. Interestingly he would not feel much of anything aside from a very mild and easily restrainable desire to dance.\"Huh, neat.\" Jun said flatly, entranced by the pulsating color flowing up and down Keph's carotid arteries.", "1512366963000": "Since her main meal was that of the pork and pickled cabbage, this is likely what Keph would swipe.Its effect was rather benevolent actually. The first thing Keph would feel was a strange sense of deja vu. Suddenly everything would feel familiar to him, as if the dining hall had been his childhood home. Next, he would start to envision himself frolicking in a field. That sense of deja vu, it wasn't related to the dining hall anymore, but rather to this bizarre vision. There he was, frolicking in a field, surrounded by... rabbits?There were dozens, perhaps a hundred of them! And they were all hopping around, chasing his toes with their little paws, and frolicking about as they waited for the fistfuls of stale bread which Keph was about to feed them.As soon as Keph swallowed, the vision would end.\"Neat huh?\" Jun grinned as she took another bite. \"What it does is it lets the diner experience the happiest memory of the chef. I think he grew up somewhere in Tawakoshi, on an island where lots of fuzzy bunnies live.\"", "1512506174000": "Jun shook her head and chuckled. She ate her meal patiently while waiting for Keph to stop looking like an acid trip.At Keph's new message, Jun nodded. \"That's fine. And it's good that you're asserting that Rara is unique. That's the sort of attitude you need to learn dark magic. It's a very, me me me sort of element. You'll probably become rather conceited by the time I'm done with you. On the flip side, I've found that charity work and helping others strengthens your bond with light energy. I can teach you that too, but maybe some other time.\"When both sides were done, Jun stood up and waved her hands at the plates. They began to levitate into the air, and then they sailed on their own towards the nearby busboy, who nodded in appreciation as the dishes landed on the cart. \"Let's head back to the training room.\" Jun said.As they got up and started to head back, Jun turned to Keph. \"So tell me, have you ever had any sort of experience with magic?\"", "1512515709000": "Jun brought Keph back to the training room, past the battle-hardened mages. A few of them recognized Jun but didn't know where the strange boy had come from. They raised their eyebrows a bit as Jun lead Keph back into the chamber. She started rummaging through her things until she pulled out a scroll, a big one which unfurled into a large, concentric seal on the floor.\"Do me a favor. Stand on that would you?\"", "1512545523000": "As soon as he stepped onto the paper, two of the eight symbols began to glow. This wouldn't mean anything to Keph.But apparently, it meant a lot to Jun. For when she saw the symbols glowing, her eyebrows furrowed and she stared.\"Huh... that's interesting. It says you have an affinity for both light and dark. Either that or... no it couldn't be.\"After a few seconds, Jun folded her arms sort of stared at Keph's chest, in thought. Then, as if snapping out of a very serious sort of trance, she seemed to perk up a bit. \"Have you ever heard of chaos energy before?\"", "1512622018000": "\"Hmm...\" Jun scratched her head, folded her arms, and continued to stare at the scroll for a few seconds. \"Hmm...\"Jun then turned to Keph's actual face, with a sympathetic smile. \"Sorry, I don't mean to be rude. It's just that, I guess it's time for another story. Oh, where to begin...\"Jun reached out a hand, palm face up, towards Keph. A spherical cloud of sparkling lights appeared and danced around the center of her palm. Then she held out her second hand. Jun seemed to strain. She strained very hard. Finally, she closed her first hand into an angry fist, extinguishing the lights. In her other hand appeared something like a flame, but pitch black. The flame also gave off no heat.\"Light and dark energy are equal opposites. They're special, at least in my tribe. A person who can use both light and dark magic simultaneously is only born once every few hundred years. They're known as a chaos mage, because the level of control they have over the elements is, well, chaotic. They are also usually instigators of great change, which adds to their namesake since change is more closely aligned with chaos, and stability with steadiness, or stagnation depending on your point of view. A chaos mage's magic has a unique energy that can touch all the spectrum of elements. All magic is kind of the same to them. It has something to do with a chaos mage's sense of self too. They're usually... um... very enlightened people. It's how they can talk to all the elements, if that makes sense.\" She pointed to the scroll. \"The tell-tale sign of a young chaos mage is having an affinity for light and dark simultaneously, which is otherwise very rare.\"She put her hands down. \"My grandmother was the last chaos mage. So I know quite a bit about them.\" She raised her hand and grinned. \"Don't get ahead of yourself. You're not a chaos mage. If you were you'd have a strong affinity for magic from a young age. You'd probably be throwing fireballs just out of instinct. You'd probably be even stronger than me already. But, your friend Rara seems to... how do I explain it? It eats all magic, and that weird beam it fired, it didn't seem to have any particular affinity. So I think Rara might be related to chaos energy. It's sort of a... a universal affinity. I think Rara is causing you to have this alignment.\"", "1512793967000": "Jun was rather self-absorbed during her recounting of some of the Land-Tiller's lore. Her frustration came from the shadows of a once raging jealousy Jun once had towards her grandmother, a jealousy which might have taken her down a very dark path. All she needed to do, a simple thing yet totally out of her reach, was create a pool of light and a pool of darkness, one in each hand. If she could do this, she could cast some of the most powerful spells the world had ever seen.But she couldn't, and she never would. And for an overachiever like herself, this took a great deal of effort to come to turns with.She suddenly became aware of Keph's feelings when she saw his determined look and thumbs up. She suddenly realized how brave Keph was, so much so that it actually made her a little wide-eyed. Everything she was dumping on him, all the pressure, and all concerning a mysterious and powerful abomination from another world, and there he was, determined and adorable-looking.\"Keph...\" Jun reached out and put a hand on his shoulder. \"You're a brave young man, and not the stupid reckless kind of brave that I am... well except when you're eating you human drug trip you.\" She chuckled and pulled the hand away. \"I'll be honest. I don't know if I'm the most qualified person to help you and Rara. Magic is one of the most mysterious forces in the world, and even I know only a fraction of all there is to know out there. So, I'm not gonna make you do anything you don't wanna do. And I'm not gonna pretend I'm the most qualified person to do this.\"She grinned. \"But if you'll let me try to help, I can promise I'll try really, really hard not to screw up.\"", "1512889136000": "\"Ok... Alright then.\"Jun punched her palm with her fist. \"I won't let you down.\" She said with renewed resolve.\"Now, first thing's first- oh. Mind if I...\" She bent down and tugged at the scroll that Keph was standing on. \"Nyeh, nyeh... thank you.\" After Keph got off, she rolled up the scroll and put it away.\"Alright. I think I'd like to, first of all, test my theory about dark magic helping you make the transition into the void. That means you're going to have to learn some dark magic. And that means, first and foremost-\"Jun extended her hand to the panel of glyphs. And so the lights in the room began to dim, and dim, and dim some more. \"-is teach you to embrace the dark.\"It wasn't long before the entire room was now pitch black. Keph would hear Jun taking several footsteps back.\"Stay calm.\"Keph would suddenly feel the intense desire to not stay calm. He would suddenly feel a strange feeling of anxiety wash over him. There was clearly a peculiar energy coming from Jun.\"If you wanna stop, let me know. Believe it or not, I can see your notebook just fine.\"", "1512970731000": "\"Good. Good.\" Jun's voice said through the darkness. \"But I need you to keep your eyes open. I need to stay calm, regardless of the things you may or may not see. And above all, remember that nothing here is going to hurt you, and we can stop whenever you want...\"Keph would start to feel faint sensations brushing by him, soft gentle breezes, hairs perhaps?He would start to see faint outlines of menacing, bulbous red eyes off in the distance. But they were so faint. Were they even real?\"Fear is not wrong. Fear is normal. Focus on functioning regardless of the fear.\"He would hear soft growling, or maybe purring. He'd have no way to be sure.\"Keph... tell us about yourself. What kinds of things do you like? Favorite books? Childhood stories? Music? Anything really.\" Jun's voice was smooth as silk. \"We wanna know more about you.\"", "1512974966000": "\"Good... good...\"The phantasms seemed to circle around Keph now. The eyes were a bit more real. The growls were definitely growling and not purring. The ethereal visions seemed almost... upset, annoyed.\"Think about the things that make you, you. Think about what makes you special. Now tell me, what are your favorite things? What are your favorite things in the world? What do you care about the most?\"Keph would start to pick up heavy breathing from somewhere in the distance, as if he was being hunted by a hungry animal. Or perhaps there were two or three.", "1513102174000": "\"So... hunting, fishing, exploring, eating... Good. Focus on those. Focus on who you are.\" Jun's voice cooed through the darkness.You're lying.\"Remember what makes you, you.\"Liar! You don't care about those things. You don't care about anything!Although Jun's voice was reassuring, there was another voice calling through the darkness. It was as if Jun's echo had developed its own will and a malicious turn.\"Remember who you are. Stand up for yourself. Get mad if you have to.\"You're nothing. You're just a freak. Freaks don't have likes. Freaks don't have interests. You're a waste of time and space. Fishing? Hah! I'll bet you couldn't catch a cold! Exploring? You'd get lost in a bathroom stall. Anyone can eat you fool, and you have awful taste.\"Don't close your eyes. Don't cover your ears. Use your words. They can see your journal. They can see how strong you are.\"Only an idiot would make friends with an abomination like Rara.Your journal is stupid.Your hair is ugly.\"Be strong, Keph. Use your words to fight back.\"The phantasms continued to circle and growl with increasing ferocity.", "1513112406000": "Through the darkness, Keph would hear Jun snort.\"You're a natural Keph.\"No you're not! Shut up!\"You shut up.\"No, you shut up!The phantasms seemed to back away from Keph, the faint red outlines of their bulbous eyes lining up in a row in front of Jun's presumed position. Keph would notice that their appearance was slightly clearer. He would just barely make out a sharp talon here and some curly horns there.\"Learning to control darkness is a lot like standing up to a bully. It's about making your sense of self bigger than anything anyone can throw at you. When my grandmother trained me like this, I reacted by saying I was bigger and better than the darkness. And when they said I was small, when they called me out on it, I insisted that one day I would become bigger and badder and stronger, that nothing would stop me from beating them up... I was a cute little kid, really. Anyways, I digress. You'd be surprised how much some people struggle with this.\"She snorted again. \"Bathroom stall. Haha.\"She cleared her throat. \"I'm gonna hold your hand through this next part. You're not strong enough to manipulate dark energy yet, but at least you've earned its respect. Now I'm gonna give you some energy to play with.\"Keph would start to feel something in front of him. It was like a warm, noxious mist. It had a musky smell to it, and it burned slightly. Most of all, it would increase Keph's sense of fear and anxiety.\"The more you focus on your sense of self, the less painful being in its presence will be. After a while it'll actually start to feel good, like a sort of coffee buzz. But that's several sessions away I think, even for you. Just hang tough. Now... using your hands and your thoughts, try making something out of it, maybe something scary that'll stand up to my friends here.\"Keph would still have trouble seeing Jun's silhouette, as the room was still pitch black, but it was clear she was referring to the mysterious phantasms in between them.", "1513388740000": "It seemed like Jun was watching in the darknesses. Her voice periodically made faint exclamations like \"ah huh\", \"oh I see\", \"oooh,\" and \"yah that's it\". And when the mini-Rara was finished, Jun made a little clapping noise. \"Nice. Alright. I'm gonna give you another little loan. I think it's about time you saw what you were up against. Again, don't be alarmed.\"Keph would start to feel something warm and uncomfortable crawling on his face. For a brief moment, it would seem like his visage was being mounted by multitudes of ants. Then the musky smell and sense of anxiety would increase, until finally the sensation would reach his eyes. The experience would be suffocating, except he could breathe just fine.And now, he could see. It was as if the darkness had been ameliorated somehow, but not with actual light. The sensation would also vanish, and his eyeballs would feel pleasantly warm.His mini-Rara was being stared down on by three horrific, disgusting creatures. They were a mishmash of predatory traits from every child's worse nightmares, combined with scaly skin and muscular limbs. At least one of the monsters seemed to have a mouth inside another mouth. They all had either horns\u00a0or other various spikey parts to make up for horns. They also all had great, bulbous, cave-dweller-esque\u00a0red eyes.Jun herself stood behind them. She still looked like a young brunette with grey robes. But her skin was pallid, and her eyes were the same candy-apple red glow shared among her scaly peers. She was also surrounded by what looked like black flames that did not consume.She gave a sinister grin and raised her hand, waggling her ghostly fingers at Keph. \"Hello.\"The creature on the far left raised its clawed and mimicked Jun's reserved greeting. Hopefully, Keph would see the humor in this.\"Now then. Have your mini-Rara fight one of the creatures. Use your willpower. The stronger it is, the better your friend will do. Also try to remember that it isn't the real Rara. So you know, don't feel too bad if your first attempt isn't very... er, successful.\"", "1514100237000": "Keph was surprising her more and more. Not only were her dark forms amusing him, but he also seemed to be resisting the idea that the dark form he had created wasn't Rara.It was actually a little annoying. Being in this state of darkness, Jun's ego was just as inflated as anyone else's, and the fact that Keph was overcoming the training with such relative easy was almost insulting to her.Almost.Maybe she was wrong. Maybe this creature, Rara, was,\u00a0in fact, helping him somehow. Could it be they maintained some sort of link which was helping him with the training? Could the mini-Rara actually have a bit of the real Rara inside it?There was only one way to find out. As the mini-Rara attacked, Jun decided to make raise the difficulty of the challenge, just a little bit.As the mini-Rara charged forward, inky strands of blackness suddenly extended from the flanking creatures and attached themselves to the center creature like webs. As they did so, the flanking creatures shrank slightly, and the center creature grew. And then it brought its claws down on top of mini-Rara with enough force to send it crashing into the training room floor-BOOM!... Imagine her surprise when mini-Rara survived! \"Incredible...\" She said softly as the two creatures wrestled with each other, surprisingly evenly matched!", "1514624921000": "Jun had to resist not entering extreme try-hard mode.But actually she was having a lot of fun. Keph was foolishly brave, individualist, and irreverent, all perfect qualities for learning dark magic. And the dark energy responded well to him.More importantly Jun got the impression that Keph wasn't a bad guy at all. He wasn't evil, and was unlikely to use anything he learned fot nepharious deeds.... It was biting. It could bite. When did it get teeth?!Jun made a face. She felt like she needed to remind Mini Rara who was in charge.Her beast would grab Mini Rara and try to suplex it into submission.", "1515035495000": "Jun would have preferred that Keph stuck to the plan. But paradoxically his strong will and defiance only accelerated his grasp of dark magic.As Keph struck, he would find that his mini Rara was getting back up, and starting to grow a bit bigger. As Keph's blade struck, it would release something that looked like violet embers.Of course that didn't stop Jun's monster from catching the blade and casually throwing it back!\"What... That all you got?\" Jun taunted, hoping to goad Keph on. The monster sneered, bearing ethereal violet teeth.", "1515312523000": "Keph hadn't noticed that the darkness was manifesting on his end more and more. His sword had an aura to it. Mini Rara was getting stronger. Even his arrow heads burned with purple flames.The beast held its own, its long sinewy arms grappling with the octopus-like creature's tentacles as if it planned to turn it into sashimi! But it wasn't expecting the arrows, and its shoulder recoiled and it began stumbling back. The Keph Rara duo was starting to get the upper hand.Jun did notice Keph's connection to the darkness getting stronger, and was both pleased and concerned. Maybe they were taking things too quickly?She noticed he was flanking the beast, and in doing so seemed to be getting closer to her.Uh oh, she thought. But she didn't react just yet.", "1515557644000": "Jun had partially expected something like this, but didn't quite have the presence of mind to do something about it. Her concentration had been split, and so when Keph came-\"OOF!\"She felt the impact in her gut and was knocked off her feet. Her eyes grew wide with surprise, though they closed briefly as her back impacted the training room floor.Then it all went away. In that split second everything seemed to become mundane and normal. The lights went back on, the sickly warmth would disappear from Keph's head, and most importantly mini-Rara and Jun's monster all disappeared in a cloud of smoke. Everything was back to normal. Jun was no longer a glowy-eyed specter in the back of a phantasmagorically black room. Nope, it was a training room again. Lesson over, for the moment.Jun blinked up at Keph, her lips flattened disapprovingly, though it was obvious she was suppressing a grin.", "1515565970000": "Jun rolled her eyes and allowed more of the grin to come through. She gently smacked Keph on the forehead. \"I'll live.\" She sat up and rubbed her diaphragm, her face squirming slightly. \"My fault for pushing you too hard. We should probably take a break.\"She sat up and waved her hand at the nearby panel. Two couches appeared nearby made of pure light energy. They were ethereal and fluffy looking, and Jun leaped onto one, bouncing gently up and down on it.\"You were doing really well.\" She said while still bobbing up and down slightly. \"But you shouldn't get carried away, especially if you wanna learn light magic down the line. Dark magic is very self-centered and focuses on your identity, but light magic requires you to look outside yourself. That reminds me, did any of that darkness feel icky towards the end or did you get used to it?\"By now Jun was no longer bobbing, just gently floating on the light. She gestured Keph to join her on the second couch.", "1515708535000": "Jun cocked her head at his thumbs up. He did hear her right?\"Um... yaaaaay. Ok, alright. So...\" As she spoke, she placed her hand on her couch, which seemed to cause it to levitate slightly and glide over to a spot near Keph's feet. The other couch followed and joined Jun's couch together, forming a big couch mattress. If Keph didn't want it, she wasn't going to let such a wonderous thing go to waste! She started playfully bouncing up and down on the great couch fort. \"...Since you clearly... have a... talent for... dark magic... once you've... rested a bit... see if... you can... manifest... your own... aura... of darkness... I'll show you... the steps... It doesn't have to... be very strong... even a little bit... will test my... theory... that dark magic... will help... luuuube you into the void...\"She stopped bouncing up and down the twin couches. She was a little out of breath.", "1515810046000": "Jun sighed exasperatedly at Keph. She flipped over and laid back on the double couches. \"Teenagers.\"Then she started mouthing the words \"lube you into the void\" silently over and over again.There was a loud snorting sound from the double couches. Jun had apparently caught the immaturity bug. It started as a titter and then erupted into a full-on\u00a0chortle.She would join Keph in his immaturity for a good minute, or until Keph stopped, whichever came first.", "1516072161000": "It wasn't lost on her that Keph had the maturity of a teenage boy, which was logical because he was, of course, a teenage boy.Lying on her stomach, chin resting on the top of her interlocking fingers, she just sort of stared at Keph idly, still a bit amused, waiting for him to stop.\"I wonder if this is what it's like having a goofy little brother.\" She said this audibly.\"You are quite welcome, Keph. To tell you the truth, I needed something like this to take my mind off of the last mission I went on.\" She sighed and rolled facing upwards. \"People your age should be able to have some fun. They should be allowed to have childhoods, to be immature once in a while. It's important to be responsible, but there's a, a certain natural order to things...\"She realized it would be better if she didn't discuss the mission with him. It would ruin the moment, and it was her burden to bare, not his.She rolled back to face Keph again. \"When you're ready to try, sit up straight with your knees crossed, and focus on your breathing and diaphragm. Focus on your inner-most self. Focus on that deep black part of you, the deepest part, the part of you that's willing to confront all the things that make you you, both good and bad. And then, kinda get it to reach out like a big hand, and feel for something outside of you, hidden in the air. In my tribe, magic is a bit like forming a bond with the natural energy in the air. It's like forming a friendship. And different elements are able to form bonds with different aspects of yourself. And when you feel that connection, ask it to cover you up. Does all that make sense?\"", "1516221279000": "\"That's good. Now reach out for that weird, caustic feeling, that darkness I lent you. The energy is all around you, it's a part of the air. Breath it into you, and let it form a blanket around you.\"If he was successful, he would start to feel wrapped up in an odd, warm blanket, a feeling that his internal self had somehow manifested outside of himself.\"It should feel like, there's more of you around you, like your soul is too big for your body and is sticking out, if that makes sense. The feeling will feel like a quiet anger, a tempered rage. Don't treat it as foreign. Treat it as part of yourself.\"If it worked, he would start to manifest a dark aura around him, like soft, violet flames.\"And when you feel it's stable, you can open your eyes. You should see yourself covered in this energy.\"Jun would watch this progress carefully, eyeing everything Keph did with a mixture of anticipation and concern for his well-being. She was ready to step in in case something went wrong, though she doubted anything would. The risk to Keph should have been minimal. It didn't stop her from gulping nervously though.", "1516252979000": "\"Uh, Keph?\"The energy that appeared around Keph wasn't what she was looking for.\"Oh... Huh...\"She sat up suddenly and sat on the edge of the twin couches. She gazed deep into the aura and noticed how... empty it felt. It wasn't a energy, but a bizarre lack of ener-\"Ok, not quite what I was expecting. Although I guess it does confirm my theory that dark magic training would-\" She paused in mid-sentence. Now wasn't the best time. \"Uh, Rara, is that you? Are you in there?\" She wanted to touch Keph's shoulder, but she was afraid that the presence might suck her mana dry, and she very much needed that in case Keph was in trouble. She quickly got up and started towards her bag to retrieve the seeds she had gathered before.\"Alright, Rara, Keph, one of you better talk to me.\" She said as she was rummaging for the seeds. \"Ah, there we go.\" She grabbed them and watched Keph's body to see if he responded at all. This was just in time to see the puddle of inkiness collapse on the floor.Forget anti-magic. Maybe I should have been looking for a mop.", "1516326631000": "Jun leered at the pool of darkness on the floor. \"Look, Rara, I don't know if that's you or not, but please don't take this the wrong way. I'm just gonna need you to go back home.\"She tossed the seeds in the air, then quickly held her hand out. The seeds floated in midair and started to descend all around Keph in a ring shape. Once they were in position, Jun began funneling energy into the seeds. Their hard little brown shells split open, releasing rapidly growing vines. Each vine, in turn, released little off-shoots coated in a sticky, mucous-like substance.He did say anti-magic was the thing to use, right?The sticky sundew-like vines sprung to life all over Keph, and they started writhing and pulsing. It seemed like they were feeding off of something in the air and from the very floor itself. What they were doing was consuming all the magical energy in the area and shunting it to the cores contained within their pods. The plants would generate more vines and off-shoots and some of them would start feeding directly off the dark pool on the ground. Some latched right onto Keph's body and wrapped around him, sucking away.Any magical effects in the vicinity of the vines would lose power and fade away. In theory, this meant only a perfectly normal Keph, lacking any aura of any kind, would remain.", "1516336142000": "\"Oh thank the gods.\" Jun rushed over to Keph and bent down next to him. \"You ok? Do you know what happened?\" She put his hand on his forehead and checked his pulse on his wrist. Then she started picking the anti-magic vines off him. She was being awfully fussy and motherly. She even checked his forehead a second time, as if she had forgotten she already did that.The vines, as if sensing their job was done, started retracting back into their pods. They were still a bit sticky though and would occasionally get caught on Keph's cloak. Jun had an especially hard time getting them out of his hair.Her temples were sweating slightly.", "1516394088000": "\"Eh- I got it. I got it.\" She batted back. \"Look, these vines know me a lot better than they know you.\"She rolled her eyes as he blushed.After cleaning up all the vines and taking his pulse for the third time, Jun nodded at his suggestion that he had enough. \"Oh boy, yah, I agree. Phew.\"  She wiped her head clean of sweat and picked up the seeds, whose vines had retracted into their pods and sealed up. She put them back in her bag and, once again, leaped onto her twin light couches.\"Bleh...\" She sprawled out and stared at the ceiling. The couches jiggled slightly. Keph might notice some swiss cheese-like holes along the bottom half of the couch, where some of her anti-magic vines had eaten their way through the structure.\"I'm sorry if I pushed you too hard.\" She said quietly. \"I got excited. And honestly, I'm not really sure if my theory panned out.\" She flipped over to look at Keph. \"It looked like Rara was trying to come through. I think he sensed the energy building up around you and wanted a piece of it. Or something like that.\"", "1516509473000": "The last words Keph would hear before blacking out were, \"Keph? Keph!\"...Jun had no way of knowing precisely when he'd wake up, but when he did, the first thing he'd smell is mustard.He would awaken in a very green room. As his eyes regained their focus, he'd feel a warmth like he'd been napping in a park. Eventually he'd realize that the room he was in was filled with plants. Long vines crisscrossed the ceiling. The walls were coated in climbing ferns and moss. The source of the warmth was a floating ball of yellow light, not unlike a tiny sun. It danced around, shining its warmth on where ever it deemed necessary. And as he felt around, Keph would realize he was resting on a big leaf.\"Hello guy.\"Jun was sitting close by. Her attire had changed. She was wearing a strapped gown which, while mundane enough from the top, would flare out in thick leaf-like structures towards her calves. It might take a second for Keph to realize that her dress was, in fact, made of layered leaves.The floating ball of light would pause somewhere around Keph's shoulder, suddenly shine a bright, almost blinding purple, and then quickly return to its usual yellow and fly off somewhere else.\"I'm sorry to use you as a guinea pig for so much stuff. This is an experimental healing room which uses druidic magic. How are you feeling?\"Keph would find his notebook sitting next to him.", "1516641395000": "Jun gave Keph a tight-lipped smile and stood up, revealing that she had been sitting on a chair-shaped tree stump. She snapped her fingers.A bolt of lightning enveloped her, and she was back in her grey robes.She then walked up to Keph, leaned in, with slightly narrow eyes, and gently bopped him on the forehead with her palm.She backed up and folded her arms. \"You're welcome for helping you. And for your information, that dress powers up druidic magic and makes this room more effective. I was taught how to make one by an old friend of mind.\" With that out of the way, she shook his shoulder with one hand. \"So come on, tell me, how are you feeling? If you don't tell me I'm not gonna get you a snack.\"The floating ball of sunlight continued to dance around the room. A second ball, this one made of floating water, would now be noticed by the increasingly lucid Keph. The ball occasionally spritzed at the base of the plants along the walls and floor. If he got a chance to look down at the floor, he'd see it was made of some kind of moss. The mustardy smell seemed to be coming from the leaf he was on.", "1516829000000": "Jun grinned. \"Yes, Keph can have a snack. We'll go together, maybe get some more mundane food.\" She waved a hand towards the wall opposite Keph's, and several leaves shivered to life and then slowly unfurled, revealing a vast space outside where some other mages were walking around. She'd reach a hand out to help Keph up. \"As for how long, you were out for about 8 hours. It's nightfall outside. And no, I was not watching you sleep, not most of the time anyways.\"She would help him out of the room, where it would be revealed that the room they were in was actually a small pod in an even bigger hall, filled with various experiments that seemed to be based on healing and medicine. There were experiments with crystals, platforms for magical surgery, and lots of medicinal herbs being grown in pots, among other strange things with no immediate discernable purpose. The few mages that were still around were mostly night owlish types, with thick-rimmed glasses and unkempt robes, milling about with cups of coffee. All the \"normal\" people were likely on their way to bed.\"I spent some of the time here with you, and some of the time maintaining the pod. You know I only started visiting the enclave recently? They barely had any druidic magic research going. Hehe.\" The \"pod\", the room that Keph was in, was like a giant seed pod whose internal environment was verdant green. The outside was a hard brown outer shell, a bit like a giant apple seed.", "1517553031000": "\"Well, I didn't think it would be for me either until I spent a year learning it from a ten story tall green dragon.\"Jun would walk Keph out of the room and into a hallway, back towards the magical elevator.\"You know, I have no right to ask this of you, but you and Rara have some very interesting abilities. You might be able to do a lot of good in this world, help out a lot of people. It's up to you of course. It's just... it would be nice if more people with gifts and talents used their gifts in a benevolent fashion. Not everyone does.\"Keph might perceive a slight widening of her eyes, just a brief second where her thoughts were possessed by the things she saw in the forested keep. But it was just a flash. Keph might even miss it.When they reached the brass grate protecting the elevator, Jun pulled it back and let Keph enter first. Then she followed and instructed the elevator to take them to the ground floor.\"So what are you in the mood for? Sandwiches? Fancy dinner? Chocolate? My treat.\" She smiled.", "1522811074000": "Just outside the door was a flash of light.Jun trotted into the room. Barely acknowledging any of the other guests, her eyes went straight for the virtual map. She bent down and inspected it, as if any errant spec of dust on it was unacceptable. What she really wanted to do of course was make sure that her homeland was still intact and that reinforcements were on the way.When she was satisfied, only then did she stand upright again and glance at Daedalus and Alden. \"Hi.\" She said. But her expression hadn't changed from when she was dissecting the map, regardless of the friendly faces.Ugh... not again. She thought.", "1523327059000": "Jun stares at the figures on the map, half listening to Freyja's explanation of what the Wyld actually was, along with Alden's reply, and half visualizing what horrors her friends and family might be enduring at the hands of a cruel demigod. Her hands fiddled with her robe and her temples beaded with sweat as she over-empathized with the little magical figures maneuvering on the table.When Naoki and Alden finished, she pulled out of her trance. \"Then in 200 years we'll just have to be stronger than ever. I'm sick of demigods thinking they have the right to alter the destinies of mortals.\"She swiveled to Daedalus. \"I'm coming with you. I have friends and family on the battle field. Besides, Alden can handle it. And the more lives we can save the more people we'll have to celebrate when we beat this thing.\"She smirked. She was trying to cheer herself up more than anyone.\"But wait a second.\" She turned to Freyja. \" Why would this entity choose the Expanse? My people have struggled to live harmoniously with nature longer than anyone. There is a ton of life energy there. Even the old Earthwarden gave it her blessing. Doesn't that count for anything? Are we a disease too?\"", "1523680214000": "Jun's demeanor stiffened as she bitterly accepted Freyja's explanation. She also nodded gratefully at Alden and Aia.\"Sapience is a natural aspect of the evolution of nature. This entity doesn't know the first thing about nature. It's just a jealous, greedy piece of...\"She sighed. \"Thanks for the explanation.\" She bowed slightly and turned back to Daedalus. \"I'll do whatever you want as long as we get to the front lines quickly. I wanna teach this thing that sapient life isn't to be trifled with.\"With that Jun would be off to help assemble a team and plan with Daedalus. He'd find that teleportation into the Expanse was relatively easy proposition as the Land-Tillers were not a xenophobic people. A scrying network would detect their presence, but would likely identify them as friendlies. The Land-Tiller's TERRA defense network had begun its assault on the Wyld, though at best it was only slowing it down.", "1477156647000": "\"Huh, I've never been in here before.\" She smiled at Arya before darting forward.Jun makes a flying leap onto one of the couches and, after bouncing up and down, swivels upwards and stares up at the ceiling. The stunt had messed up her hair and ruffled her clothes. In fact, a bit of her midriff had been exposed by the bunched up silk cloth underneath her back. But she didn't really care. She sighed and tried half-heartedly to blow the strands of hair covering her mouth out of the way. \"This couch would be a lot more fun if a bunch of people weren't about to die.\" She said despondently.She raised a hand in the air and, with a flash of light, summoned two light constructs above her. The glowing, quartz like objects were models of a wooden sword and shield. With a finger wave she directed the two floating objects to bash into each other playfully, all the while making little \"pew\", \"woosh\", and \"pachow\" noises with her mouth. Despite this, her face was was visibly depressed.", "1477519120000": "Jun's light constructs disappeared. The results of which construct won were inconclusive.She didn't sit up instantaneously. There was a flash of intensity in her eyes. However, it was very brief and there was little resulting change in the rest of her countenance. She lazily got up and sat straight, and folded her arms.\"I'm alright. Arya has a proposition for you and I'd like to join her with it.\"That was all she said. She didn't feel like saying anything else. Instead she just looked at Arya expectantly with a face lacking any warmth.", "1478041120000": "Well that was fast.Jun surmised that High Lady Naoki, practical as she was, would successfully talk Arya out of anything that didn't fit into her master plan. Of course, Naoki wasn't wrong. If the Isranian forces did as Naoki said they would, then siding with her own medical corp was the logical choice. With that however, Jun's hopes of even pretending to be neutral were dashed to pieces.She listened carefully to Naoki, counting the seconds until Arya changed her mind. She sighed. She was still a little disappointed. \"I am not gonna lie. I was really looking forward to being a part of a humanitarian organization. I'm positive I could have convinced my government to lend Arya the support she would need. However, you brought up a lot of good points. The best way to save lives is to make sure the war progresses as quickly and smoothly as possible. And the truth is, I can't pretend to be neutral. Lady Camilla is my friend, and she and her people deserve justice. Lady Naoki, I've known you long enough to know you already have a position in mind for me. I want to help end this war as quickly as possible with minimum lives lost. Is there any way I can be part of the final attack on their government?\"Her voice was solemn, not fiery at all. She sounded like she was asking to help with the logistics of a funeral.", "1478463357000": "Jun stood up and glared at Lady Naoki. \"I'm not neutral! My feelings are just... complicated...\" Her voice trailed off as her eyes settled on the octopus-like creature emerging from Naoki's cleavage. She immediately sensed a peculiar, but familiar energy, which reminded her of an old friend.Sensing its trepidation, she waved back and smiled gently. \"Uh, it's ok... we're not going to hurt you... Are you an associate of the Demonlord Maelik?\"", "1478935784000": "Jun's gaze blankly shifted towards Naoki. \"Yah... we'll leave it at that.\"Truthfully Jun was happy to put the tension behind them. She smirked and folded her arms.\"Of course Lady Naoki would be associated with the Demonlady of Lust.\" This absolutely did not surprise her in the least. She stepped forward and, with considerable amusement, reached precariously close to Naoki's cleavage to shake the little creature's front tentacle. \"My name is Jun. I'm a friend of Lady Naoki's. Don't be scared. I know you can sense holy energy around me but I'm not gonna hurt you. In fact, I earned my virtue of kindness by showing compassion towards Lord Maelik. One of my best friends is a giant crow from the demon realm.\"Jun's hand slipped and she gave a very odd look to both Fornilan and Naoki. It was a mix of trepidation, kindness, and audacity, an almost stupid, gaping grin if not for a certain purposefulness to it.\"My uh... ability to show kindness to those I'm supposed to hate is a point of pride... actually.\"", "1479789127000": "\"I see.\" Jun said sympathetically concerning Artemis. Even though they had only briefly met in the past, Jun understood the bond between the pair. Indeed, she hoped Artemis would recover from whatever was ailing her.That was assuming what Naoki had said about her was accurate.In any case the appropriate response was likely to drop the subject, and so once again Jun turned her attention to the octopus-like creature currently groping her boss' cleavage.\"So, Forni...\" She leaned in to pet the back of the creature's head with one finger (once again bringing her precariously within range of Naoki's bosom), \"What exactly do you do, exactly?\" She was tempted to say something about living in an aquarium but decided against it.", "1479883624000": "Jun recoiled slightly, but allowed the odd creature to scoot its way up her arm. \"Uh, uh... UH!\"Morbid curiosity prevented her from objecting. \"I guess I meant all of the above?!\"She kept glancing back and forth between the creature, Naoki, and Arya, as if looking for some sort of cue or reassurance. Her eyes seemed to scream what the f*ck what the f*ck what the f*ck! A vague pretense of a smile though was enough to give the creature consent for what it was about to do. She did have to admit, with a raise of her arm, that the thing was very cute and funny feeling as it wriggled up her arm.", "1480190709000": "Jun was mesmerized by every action the little creature took, every tentacle wiggle, every swell and pulse of the organism's squishy little body. Of all the things she had experienced in the last few years, this was by far the strangest.Hardly any change was registered in her slightly agape face as the small creature dabbed her cheek with the oil. When she felt the wetness, she gently reached up with her opposite arm to feel the oil. That's when the sensation hit her. She inhaled sharply. She was so entranced by Fornilan that she didn't even notice how not tense she actually was. Although her mind was extremely alert and carefully watching the creature, her body was very relaxed. It wasn't until she felt a sudden wave of endorphins and a warm, anxious, urgent sensation in her nether regions that she suddenly realized how good she felt.When did this happen? How did I not notice this before?She then became aware of the magic presence around her. It was a type of magic she had never seen before. It was very calming, kind, naughty. Like the elements it had a personality, but one was very distinct. Definitely demonic, but not maliciously so. It felt... good.Should I... let this happen?Jun's head drooped slightly and she stared idly at the floor, almost as if she was surrendering to something, but not quite. She slowly closed her eyes and inhaled sharply again as another tingling wave flashed through her soul.\"I... think I get the idea...\"", "1480743680000": "Jun's breath became increasingly labored. She seemed catatonic even as the little thing seeped lower and lower into her apparently coveted region. It wasn't long before her labored gasps began to resemble moans...But right before Forni made contact with the jewel of that region, (or more precisely just before it could lift the lid of the chest containing the jewel), Jun let out a-\"OH MY GOD I JUST REMEMBERED I FORGOT TO DO LAUNDRY!\"There was a bright flash of light and Forni would suddenly find himself floating in midair for a brief second as Jun had teleported straight at the door which she immediately swiveled towards in an attempt to escape. There was a very loud bang and a slightly sickening crunching sound.Jun had forgotten to actually open the door.She plopped back, her body swiveled slightly, and she sat on the floor. She stared blankly at the wooden door while attempting to process what just happened. A single drop of blood slithered its way down from her nose.Also, due to a slight teleportation malfunction, Forni, who had likely plopped onto the ground, would find a pair of panties floating down in pursuit of him. If he remained right where he was they would gently land on his head.", "1481620280000": "Jun poked the tip of her nose and muttered \"Vokrii.\" The drop of blood slid back up into her nose like magic, which was logical given that it was magic.When she was able to pull herself away from her venerable door, she slipped into a smug sort of grin, looked over to Forni, and gently petted him on the head with a single finger.Why do I exist?\"You're very kind. Very, very, very kind. Exceptionally kind.\" Jun stood back up and carefully placed Forni on her palm, before sauntering over to Madame Naoki. \"Very very, extremely, possibly excessively kind...\" Jun placed the little squid creature back into Naoki's cleavage, giving her another peculiar, indecipherable expression, a mix of smugness and annoyance perhaps? Embarrassment? Even a bit of seduction?\"Uh, so... Like I was saying, I left my stove on back home so, I should go. Also, you know, war and stuff. Gotta get ready. Have, have fun you guys. It was nice meeting you Forni. Arya, High Lady.\" She gave her cutest little wave to Forni and then strode out of the room, not waiting to listen to any inquiries about whether it was the stove or laundry she had forgotten. Just as she stepped out of the room, Naoki and Arya would catch a glimpse of her scratching her buttocks uncomfortably. Apparently she hadn't realized where the draft was coming from...It was only after she left the room that a muffled \"AW SON OF A WHOREMONGER\" could be heard from the hall. However, Jun did not return.<Exit>", "1517431492000": "There is a second squelch as Jun's boots hit the dirt from the carriage.\"Oh I really don't like this. I'm so used to dealing with friendly dragons, aside from Jarkoopi. And this guy seems distinctly... Jarkoopian, maybe worse.\" She stepped away from the carriage and walked out ahead of Naoki's path. She looked around at the carriage, and Torrin's guards, and of course Naoki, trying to assess any blind spots in their set-up.She was wearing her verdant cloth armor with accentuating lamellar plates. But as a gesture of good will, she had her coif pulled back like a hood and her helmet in her arms. She was going for a sign of... half-trust, by revealing her head. She wanted Trogdor to know she was optimistic, but not stupid.\"All I really know is that all dragons are prideful, even the friendliest ones. So if you're going to intimidate them, don't diminish them by calling them lizards or anything. Admit that they're like forces of nature, but then imply that you're not afraid of forces of nature, if that makes sense. They're big, but you're bigger. But, you know, they're still big.\"Around Jun was a very faint aura of mana, something which served a dual purpose. She wanted Trogdor to sense that she was a mage, but not a trigger happy one. That said her mana was focused on a scroll she had deposited some distance away before arriving at the meeting point, just a little insurance in case things went south.", "1517696041000": "The thick, salacious scent of Trogdor's aura made her knuckles turn white against her helmet.Yah, she recognized it. She wasn't expecting it, not after going over a year embracing a life of relative purity. The scent of his mana, the familiar, belligerent righteousness of the dagger, it almost blinded her with visions of her old self, visions of Gomrath, of a burning sky, the scent of roasting orc flesh. Her nostrils flares and her pupils dilated. Her chest rose slightly.She steeled her composure, resisting the curling of her lips into a maleficent grin. She was a professional. She practiced holy magic. She had to keep Lady Naoki safe. That was the priority. But the glimpses of red scales of Trogdor's faltering facade, belying an even more intense bloodlust, were threatening to seduce her old self out of hiding.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u201cYou cannot understand the depth of my want\u2026 my need.\"Make a wrong move, please. I want you to try to eat me...She almost forgot to question why Trogdor's presence reminded her so of the fallen demigod. She did forget to speak, letting Naoki's question go unaccompanied.Her mana's presence was unmistakable. It was white, clean, cold as snow, a stark contrast to Trogdor's sickening miasma. But the invisible force of her energy met his, taut, assertive, every so slightly bending a single leaf that stood in between them, a determination and steadfastness that bordered on predatory.", "1518119382000": "At the very mention of Stonevale, Jun's aura pulsed slightly. It took all of her concentration not to take a menacing step forward.Stonevale had a special place in her heart. It was her very first home after she had left the Expanse to start her own journey. Her very first friends outside of her tribe were made there. It was also where her best mentor, Lum'Valia, had introduced her to light magic, where she had personally helped repair the city from harm. And when Goraia took over, it was the source of many sleepless nights, struggling to resolve her conflicting feelings over the nature of war.And this overgrown red iguana wanted to buy it like a turnip farm.But then she relaxed a bit, her ire momentarily diverted by another puzzle. She was surprised that Trogdor's aura seemed to have so much give. She could feel her own aura consuming his, cleansing its presence from the air. She didn't push the effect more than an inch, at the risk of antagonizing Trogdor in a delicate situation. But that was interesting. She wondered just what was the nature of Trogdor's weapon.", "1518304115000": "What is that? Jun thought to herself. Is this energy cleansed so easily?Jun had never cleansed or blessed anything before. Holy magic had a natural ability to fight back things of darkness and evil intent, but she had never put it into practice against things like curses; she was more used to vaporizing skeletons and what-not. Trogdor's weapon seemed like it was just that, a cursed weapon with a sickly but powerful aura.She imperceptibly sighed with impatience. She could already tell that Naoki was leaning against the proposition. In truth, the idealism of having a safe haven for other races that were being oppressed appealed to her. But at the same time, his proposal was problematic. Forceful occupation and co-existence sounded like a bad idea.Her attention turned back to the blade. That blade. Where did it come from? Why was it familiar? Was Trogdor even aware of its dark power? Or how it was faltering to Jun's holy magic? Was it even really faltering? Was it a trap?By now Jun had forgotten\u00a0herself slightly and was noticeably eyeing it.", "1518993409000": "The curiosity was starting to drive her mad. She desperately wanted to try to cleanse the weapon of its dark miasma. But she also didn't want to interrupt negotiations with Trogdor and Naoki. It was so strange, to have this invisible interplay of magic happening right under Naoki's nose, which like the rest of her body was probably non-magical and couldn't sense anything odd.They had met for only a few minutes and it was already proving to be a strange experience. Jun had never ebbed and flowed between bloodlust, nostalgia, benevolence, curiosity, impatience, and contemplation in just over the span of a bathroom break.She couldn't help it. She knew she had to ask about the weapon before he left. A part of her almost hoped the negotiations would go sour so she could try to take the blade, but she wouldn't dare put her patron/friend/VIP in danger.Lady Naoki's counteroffer seemed reasonable. An alliance, a city (which it seemed Naoki was disinclined to have be Stonevale), and a safe-haven for the so-called savage races in this world. She liked it. Maybe the Land-Tillers could help vitalize the land with their magic, for the right incentive of course.", "1519409258000": "When Trogdor brought up the offer of a duel, Jun's mood hovered between concerned trepidation about the possibility of being enslaved and I AM SO FUCKING READY YOU RED-BELLIED PIECE OF SH-And then of course, Naoki, being the rational one, shut down the \"conversation\". With Trogdor revealing his true form, Jun's hand had already drawn her mythical sky blue sword and had taken a defensive stance. Her weapon trembled slightly from her white-knuckled fist. A surge of glowing snow white energy rushed into it. The strain of holding back and calming herself only made it shake even more.\u201cWe agreed to talk, and so we shall talk. Any attack on an Isran will be interpreted as such and will mean the end of our negotiations.\u201dJun took a deep breath. She relaxed her pose and lowered her sword. Not one to be blue-balled out of casting a powerful spell, however, she placed her helmet down on the ground and then held up her hand to Trogdor, as if to say \"Just a moment.\"All that energy that had surged into Resonance needed to go somewhere, so she turned to the side and took an overhead stance with her sword, directing her gaze at an upwards angle. She extended her arm out and then had her whole body follow through with a powerful downward slash. The resulting concussive airburst would cause Naoki's hair to billow wildly as an impressive crescent of blinding silvery light exploded out of the blade's path and went flying up at an angle into the foliage above them.Jun sighed deeply with relief and then sheathed her sword again. The only sound that remained was of bewildered birds flocking up into the sky. As Jun was turning to face Trogdor, dozens of felled tree limbs and branches fell to the ground along a straight path beneath where Jun had launched her attack. Jun's eyes shifted between Trogdor, Naoki, and the nearby guards. \"Sorry. Sorry guys.\" She said, somewhat red-faced. \"Uh, as you were.\"At least one intact bird's nest landed along the botanical carnage. The mother bird was nowhere to be seen.", "1520003619000": "She looks at Trogdor somewhat guiltily as he turns to leave. \"I-\"Before Jun could complete her thought she was suddenly viciously attacked from the sky.The mother bird had apparently survived and was now pecking ferociously at her scalp.\"Ok ok I'm sorry I'm sorry. Uh, crap. Lord Trogdor, she wants you to put the nest in anoth- OUCH! In another tree please?\" She struggled to put her helmet on and cover her eyes without hurting what looked like a large blue jay.In the meantime, Jun wanted to address Trogdor's hurt feelings. \"Lord Trogdo- Ouch! There are three other dragons I share a close friendship with. One is the former- ouch- earthwarden, the other is a powerful holy dragon, and the third is a blue storm dragon -ouch- who likes to pick fights every 35 seconds. If I was bound to your will, it'd be an insult to all of them. I respect your -ouch- power enough to not presume I could easily beat you. Although if you're open to duel for fun on some other occ- ouch!\"Jun really, really didn't want to strike the blue bird back. She kind of deserved this.\"Anyways, where did you get that dagger? Its power is very familiar to me, but something about it feels wrong as well.\" Jun would have liked to asked this in a demanding tone, but being attacked by a blue bird wasn't conducive to maintaining a dignified posture. So she opted for a more conversational one.", "1472247109000": "Jun had received word of a massive creature roaming about. All indications were that it was hostile. Jun glided through the air on Blackbean, the giant crow. She was clad in her dragon armor and enchanted helm.\"*Sigh* Never a dull moment. Let's go Blackbean.\"She was still several hundred meters away when she raised Resonance into the air. Mana flowed from her chains that ran from her back, into her hands, and then through the sword. Resonance itself was pleased. Yay, more bad guys to fight! Jun grinned and looked up at the blade even as it glowed wildly and began to absorb power. (Charge 1)To help the other combatants get an opening, Blackbean crowed loudly. CAAAW! Hopefully the spider would take notice and get distracted.", "1472272634000": "Still being several hundred meters away, Blackbean immediately banked left, then contorted its body to dive bomb straight down, narrowly avoiding the attack. It was all Jun could do to hang on with one hand, but as she did Resonance ignited into brilliant magic flames, leaving a trail of smoke in her wake.As they approached the ground, Blackbean would bank right in an attempt to confuse the spider. She did not have a clear shot yet, so she continued to siphon mana into her sword as she flew. (Charge 2) It was at this point that she received the telepathic communication from the Black Tower. When Blackbean was level enough, Jun quickly tapped her Black Tower standard issue necklace and then gripped Blackbean once again.Xel'rath  ,\u00a0Elizabeth Finch  , I think we need to reduce its mobility as much as possible so that the kami has a clear shot. Otherwise, it may still do serious damage to the city or even dodge the attack. You guys hear me? We've got to slow it down!", "1472404134000": "Unfortunately, there would probably be no escape. There was a brief flash of light from Jun's sword as Blackbean turned to face the creature. As soon as Xel'rath ate away at the creature's carapace, Jun cried out \"Fire Art: Flaming Dancer!\"Resonance was suddenly engulfed by a whirling torrent of fire which exploded outward like a large serpent. Indeed, once the light of the initial casting had subsided it would be revealed that flame did have something like a large, head attached to a snake-like body. The coiling, writhing flames were bright yellow and approximately\u00a015 meters in length.A shot of the flaming dragon, coiled up like a snake just before it strikes.As soon as the giant creature crouched into a leaping position to try to get away, the dragon would leap forward and \u00a0\"bite\" at the weak points in the limbs created by Xel'rath's spell, rapidly increasing the temperature in and around them. The dragon would snake its way from limb to limb, quickly destroying the spider's somatic nervous system and muscle fibers with intense heat. The dragon was lightning quick and would follow the creature even if it successfully leaped, relentlessly biting away. The spell had been charged for several seconds, and would stick around for several seconds itself, just enough time to turn their battle into Isra's largest boiled crab leg buffet. If the spider's legs were sufficient damaged it would likely not get away.Jun and Blackbean would bank away from the creature and fly out at least a hundred meters before arcing back towards it to see what it would do next.", "1472614160000": "Jun and Blackbean had cleared the area just in time to avoid the blast. When she made another pass, she noticed the outlanders. She flew down and landed with a flutter right next to the riders.\"Oh, hey! Glad we could put on a good show.\" She waved genially. \"As for that... well, that's Isra's ultimate defensive weapon, the Kami.\" She looked back to bear witness to the smoldering ruins of the creature, with not a little bit of pride. \"I can't tell you much more. State secrets and what not. My name is Jun. I'm a Sun Marshall who helps protect Isra. Who are you guys?\" She spoke with a peppy tone. For some reason she was in a very good mood, probably because she hadn't done anything heroic in a while.As she addressed the travelers she pulled out a piece of beef jerky from her pouch and placed it in Blackbean's maw. She lovingly stroked his feathers for a job well done.", "1472667434000": "\"Oh. So you're made up of refugees.\" Jun's face became inquisitive, and her demeanor more solemn. \"Do you have many refugees from Aaedan and the former Medan?\"Regardless of the Aozoran's answer, Jun would add \"Well, if your government stands for justice and protecting the innocent and you ever need some firepower, feel free to ask for me. I mostly specialize in elemental combat. I'm also a decent cook.\" Jun winked.With that said she gave Blackbean a light tap with her heel. Blackbean spread out its wings yet again and the pair would take off, assuming the Aozorans had nothing to add.", "1460254691000": "With a bright flash, Jun arrives inside the room. She was used to teleporting short distances, but knowing that she was now in Isra was an odd feeling indeed.So this was the infamous Madam Naoki. As soon as she laid eyes on her, her first priority became not staring at the cat ears. Do not stare at the cat ears. DO NOT STARE AT THE CAT EARS!\"It's good to finally meet you.\" She cautiously extended her hand in friendship. A chill went up her spine. She could sense unfamiliar magic everywhere.", "1460257110000": "Jun smirked slightly at Naoki's teasing wink, and of course took the ring. But as soon as Naoki turned around, Jun allowed her face to contort into nervousness and fear. What the heck had she gotten herself into?As they walked, Jun continued to sense additional sources of magic. Runes, glyphs, the occasional odd footsteps, etc. Naoki herself seemed like the most normal thing in the hallway, which was saying quite a bit considering she had a... tail.\"How I started? Well, it's a bit personal but... It honestly started because I was insecure about myself and my importance as a human being. I was young, you know how it is. My grandmother was this amazing, all-powerful sorceress who helped save my tribe on several occasions, and I just wasn't content to being a bookworm. I originally left without telling my family. It was just me and some of her things, looking for something to do. Medan was the first thing I came across. Princess Camilla's lady in waiting was my first job.\"Jun's face turned red as soon as she said Camilla's name. She had originally made a note to mention her as little as possible.\"Uh, so yah, I was working for the royal family. But after we failed an important mission I decided I needed to become stronger, so I left in search of more adventure, and I guess I've been doing that ever since. It's never a dull moment. I think I've almost died like...\" Jun  raised her hand and examined her outstretched fingers. \"Let's see... the wraith, that titan, climbing that mountain, Fundor, the army of trolls... I feel like I'm forgetting something... guess the mountain counts as twice... six times?\"She chuckled. \"Sorry, I guess I've started rambling.\"", "1460260567000": "Jun laid back a bit. She was still nervous, but Naoki was being very polite and hospitable.\"Ugh, you'll have to forgive me. I've got so much on my mind...\" It would be another few seconds before Jun thought of a proper question. \"So, a club owner is also the head of a group of pseudo, mercenary police... thing...\" Her voice trailed into incompetent articulation, and she pressed her hands together and literally began twiddling her thumbs.\"I guess my question is, what is it that you want out of this world?\" It was odd, but as soon as she came up with this question, she was able to look at Madame Naoki straight in the eyes, without any fear or insecurity. She decided she would rather just cut to the chase and see what kind of woman Naoki was right then and there.Her eyes would have a piercing, confident quality to them despite the fact that her overall countenance was still slightly timid and befuddled. Her thumbs were now quite steady.", "1460267908000": "Jun listened intently to every single word that Madam Naoki was saying. By the time it was over, she was staring so intently at an invisible spot in her mind's eye which happened to coincide with a single rune on the wall as her brain's gears were overworking themselves to understand. She appears stunned.After about 20 seconds Jun starts laughing.\"Heh, hehe, hahahaha. HAHAHAHA!... My life is absurd...\" Jun turned to Naoki as though she was her best friend and had known her for years. \"You know, in my culture... it's complicated.\" Far more relaxed than she had ever been since arriving in Gauldin (even though she wasn't in Gauldin anymore), Jun reached up, stretched, and placed her hands in the back of her head.\"You know, it's funny, I barely have an answer to my own question... I spent so much time steeped in the darkness of a specific goal, a specific ideal, a single... a single paradigm. And yet, I find myself painfully aware of the fact that... well... it's just a story. My entire life, everything I believe in, my family, my faith, is merely a story that I want to play out. In a funny way, I'm obsessed with my life, but at the same time I know it's just one of infinite stories in this world, all equally unique and beautiful. And I get excited every time I encounter another person's story, a new way of being. Some stories are long, and some are short, but they're all so... wonderful, in their own way.\"Jun finally gets tired of standing and slumps to the floor. She sits there, balled up and cozy. \"My father once told me I'm not quite an old soul. I'm too obsessed with achievement, making something of myself, and saving the world. But I don't know. There's just so much to see in this world, I wanna give myself every opportunity I have to see as much of it as I can. I find... I find a strange joy in not being at peace. I...\" She turned to Naoki with a mischievous yet sheepish grin. \"I... like the pain of life, the drama... I find it beautiful. It's... one great big beautiful story, and I'm absolutely in love with it. My physical body is covered in scars. My mind is a messy conglomerate of ideas barely holding itself together with the vague concepts of love and kindness and light, and I like it.\"Jun chuckled yet again. \"The... the absurdity of me even encountering you in the first place, you, a hidden goddess among men... I just couldn't help but laugh.\"Jun took a deep breath. \"I know everything I need to know to trust you. Although it would seem we both suffer from the unfortunate affliction of thinking too much.\"", "1460276345000": "\"Mm hmm!\" Jun nodded and grinned. \"I hope so...\" She stands back up. Now her thoughts begin to drift back to Lum'Valia and how she became a holy mage. \"You know, the Celadine have a teaching that might make you feel better. Umm...\" Jun reached around to grab her pack, and pulled out her precious diary, which contained a summary of all of her adventures, as well as those of her grandmother's. \"Most people in my tribe believe in reincarnation, in case you were wondering, but that's not important, umm... here we go.\"She started reading:\"Humans chase the meaning of life the way dogs chase their own tails, the way cats chase their own reflections. They are seeking themselves without even realizing it. They are the answer to their own question.\"She looks up at Naoki with a sardonic grin. \"This stupid quote drove me nuts when I was a kid. No one even knows where it came from. I used to think it meant you could be as selfish as you want.\" Then her face became warmer. \"But it means that, life itself is its own meaning. Life is the only thing in the universe that can even ask what its meaning is. Whenever we chase after something, we're chasing after a small aspect of a greater truth... And once you realize that life is the most valuable thing in the universe, the answer to what to do with life becomes obvious. Cherish and protect life as much as you can, not just your life but all life. Because your life is part of that greater meaning, and so is everyone and everything else's. Individual stories seem temporary, like they're disappearing, but they are connected to the rest of the universe and all the other infinite stories that life is capable of producing.\"By now she was speaking in earnest. She closed her diary. \"So in a way you got it right. Love and protect the people around you. It's the best way to achieve immortality... I guess that means I disagree with it being a joke. The way people try to pursue things in life, wealth, power, love, reputation, that's the joke. People chasing their own tails is the joke. Life is so much more that that. Life, life itself is amazing... And... I wish more people understood that.\" At these last words her face dropped and she became melancholy.But then her sheepish grin returned. \"Sorry, I wasn't trying to say you were wrong exactly, it's just how I see it. Two sides of the same coin, y'know? I became a lot more enthusiastic about life ever since Lum'Valia helped me become a holy mage. In the end, all holy teachings are about protecting the sanctity of life. Being selfless and loving towards others means that you understand you're part of a greater whole. But people get hung up on specifics and then... well then it becomes a joke too.\"She peers out towards the doorway. \"Speaking of which, she sure is taking her sweet time.\"", "1460324307000": "\"Master Lummie!\" Jun reciprocated the hug with all her strength, even as the relatively diminutive girl was being suffocated by Lum'Valia's cleavage. \"Your dress! Your hair! What happened to you!?\" She said this while muffled, before finally deciding she needed more oxygen. \"Oh, me and Naoki here were discussing meaning of life stuff.\"Jun winked at Naoki. \"So what happened?!\"", "1460331464000": "Jun hung on every word. She especially looked aghast at the fact that Arya was almost killed.\"Temperance huh?\" Jun felt she needed some temperance after hearing about Zephidel's... indiscretions. She wasn't gonna lie. A part of her immediately wanted to learn how to perform the Seraphim's Seal of Temperance.\"I mean, there's no question that I'm in. Absolutely. You've done so much for me it's the least I can do... Seraphim's Seal of Temperance huh?\"", "1460502585000": "\"Arya!\" Jun smothers her with a hug (which is not easy considering how tall and pointy Arya is), the memories of her saving Jun's life on the mountain top still fresh in her mind.Her expression changes as soon as Naoki addresses her. \"I see.\" Jun gingerly takes the envelop, and the card, from Naoki's hands. \"It uh... it should be an, interesting read.\" With all the philosophical discussions and being reunited with Lum'Valia, Jun had almost forgotten about Camilla. She was convinced that killing Zephidel in hatred wasn't the answer, but a promise was a promise. One way or another she needed to figure out how to deal with Goraia...But not at the moment. Right now, Lum'Valia needed help. She carefully put the precious file and business card away.\"Thank you Madame Naoki. I'm looking forward to it. Alright, Arya, Lum'Valia, let's do this.\"", "1462464467000": "<Enter from Gauldin>Jun had just completed her business with Commander Viddik and was pleased with herself that the mission had been a success. With her new pendant in hand and Blackbean the demon crow on her shoulder, she arrived in the teleportation room and was on her way to see Madam Naoki.That's when she saw them... in her mind, there was a vision of strange men attacking the streets of Isra. \"What the...\" Accessing the telepathic link with the stone Naoki had given her, she concentrated. Then she saw them, indeed, pyromancers attacking the streets.Without a second thought she ran outside the Black Tower. Off in the distance she could see smoke and flames rising from the center of Isra. People around her were talking and spreading rumers. \"Ok Blackbean, something tells me we have work to do...\" She tapped the creature's head to dismiss the shrinking spell on it, and it grew to the size of a large horse. With a flash of light, she was in her armor. She hopped onto the creature's shoulders. \"Let's go.\"<Exit to central plaza>", "1463371041000": "Jun appeared in the teleportation room and jogged over to Tristian's office. When she arrived at the door, she took a deep steadying breath and gave a little salute to the Black Tower commander.\"Uh, you sent SIR?!\" Jun's head swiveled towards the humanoid mass of darkness next to her. Xel'rath was one of the Black Tower's denizens she simply could not acclimate to. Her sensitivity to magic didn't help either. Xel'rath was a living generator of blackness.\"Xel'rath.\" She nodded politely as best she could. A single drop of sweat inched down her left temple.", "1463448561000": "Jun's hairs stood on end as Tristian described the situation to her. Her heart was pumping with every word.... Dad...Feeling an overwhelming sense of determination, and national pride in the Land-Tiller forces, Jun nodded.\u00a0\"I'm in. I need to go to the Nokari mountains right away to get Lum'Valia, and from there we will meet with Xel'rath and Ildesias at the border. We'll take this necromancer down, you have my word.\" She then looked to Raiko. \"Just so you know, the Land-Tiller's defenses on the eastern border are definitely the weakest, since it's mostly harsh desert land and they have no need for much protection. They mostly consist of mercenaries and volunteers. Generally they are long range cavalry, so if you can, plan your forces accordingly.\"Jun immediately marched out of the room. But before she was out of earshot she called back to Xel'rath. Her view of him had changed significantly in those brief moments, and with renewed confidence came a bit of snark towards the dark being.\"Try not to eat too many undead before we get there. I didn't wanna say anything but eating supernatural beings tends to make you gassy.\" She sneered to herself as she strolled away.With that she headed towards the teleportation room and set the coordinates to the chalet. From there she will go to Lum'Valia's lair.<Exit>", "1453248881000": "Jun was in awe as to how Lum'Valia's healing magic could be used to heal demons. She herself wasn't capable of wielding light and dark magic at the same time, so it never occurred to her that she might be able to heal her demon crows.But that's not what was really occupying her. She was more than a little self-absorbed with a project that she had been working on, a type of magical skill she could not for the life of her ever get the hang of.Magically transforming her clothing.Every time she tried to do it she expended a large amount of mana and damn near set herself on fire.But for some reason she sensed her new outfit would help her out. (She was wearing it by the way.)...Burr it's cold.On the world outside of her mind she had been using wards to study her outfit's magic properties some more, all while making notes.She breathed a little sigh of relief when Lum'Valia finished healing Maelik. \"You know, it just occurred to me, Maelik must have a rather exciting... bedside manner. Does he... know your true form is the size of an apartment building?\"", "1453252820000": "Jun's face turned pale as soon as Maelik addressed her. He doesn't know. The bastard doesn't know!Her lips then curved into a lascivious smile as the inspiration for a smart-aleck response leaped into her brain.\"Well... I wouldn't wanna ruin the surprise but let's just say you shouldn't run into any major difficulties provided you're well-endowed enough. Now, where was I?\" She said this while sitting down next to the fire.She started magically inscribing runes onto her old outfit, her purple Verri uniform, in strategic places. Her armor was packed up in a knapsack next to her, and she would work on those next. She muttered to herself, \"This is gonna work. I think this is actually gonna work...\"", "1453348413000": "Jun dismissed Lum'Valia's comment without a word. She thought to herself: Those things are not normal kids. The closest thing we have to a normal kid here is Doobie. Her tongue was pressed against the corner of her upper lip in concentration. She was just about done magically inscribing runes into all three of her outfits. Every few seconds she'd take some\u00a0hor d'oeuvres to help fuel her brain.She cringed, and clasped her hands together.FLASH!She was wearing her outfit. She blinked. Her face scrunched up once again.FLASH!She was wearing her armor.FLASH!Once again she was wearing her new dress.\"I DID IT! Ahhhhh...\" Jun fell on her back and looked up at the sky with a satisfied look. She released a large, pleasurable sigh. A few seconds she sat back up. \"So, what did I miss?\"", "1453354084000": "Jun has seen children before.\"Thanks! You-your dresses are very pretty too!\" She said this with a voice an octave higher than normal.There was a bright flash. Jun unconsciously switched into her armor. \"Hehehehehe...ehehehe... eh.\" Jun was rapidly devouring salmon while continually glancing at Lum'Valia and Doobie.", "1453436541000": "Jun shakes her head. \"Oh, no... Umm, I was just.. practicing. Although I guess it is kinda convenient if things get heavy.\" She looks on at the spectacle unfolding in front of them. She wasn't sure if she wanted to get involved. She was pretty low on mana.Then again... thanks to Fundor... she could use the heat from the cooking fire as a power source...She eventually got to the ribs the Maelik had made. She took a bite. Lum'Valia's cooking was heavenly of course, but Maelik was supposed to be legendary for his skills.Chomp!...Jun suddenly completely forgot about the twins. She couldn't explain the sensation, like something beautiful, like a phoenix rising from the ashes or an evanescent rainbow, had just rushed by her without giving her the chance to appraise its magnificence. But how was this possible? They were just ribs! She'd had ribs before. She'd had good cooking before! Lum'Valia, the cooks on the pineapple farm, Rowena Fletcher, her own father, they were all excellent cooks. But none of them had ever made her feel emotional over not savoring a bite. And to top it all off, she felt an incredible relief knowing there was still plenty of rib meat on the bone.No, this time she would take her time. She once again took a bite, peeling the meat carefully from the darkened bone, allowing the flesh to slide its way passed her lips, every individual droplet of juice touching every possible nerve ending in her delicate mouth. Every single movement of mastication had the gravitas of a soldier's march. Every second of warm saliva being excreted by the glands in her mouth, to dance a soft, moist ballet with the juices of the meat, carried with it the royal grandeur of a symphony.Her eyes widened. Her pulse quickened. Her legs twitched and squirmed. A pleasant chill ran from her stomach up through spine and simultaneously down through her loins to her feet. Her hands shook. She started gasping for air, but the moment her lungs were sufficiently saturated with oxygen, she took another bite; and another, and then another, and then another, gasping for air in between, until... until...\"OH MY GOD THESE ARE AMAZING!\" She could no longer keep silent. She stood up (again, not even thinking about the twins) and darted next to the potential combatants. \"ARYA! ARY-\" She stopped. She was going to beg her to remain and enjoy Maelik's cooking. But instead... \"UH, uh... since you don't want anything to do with Maelik's cooking, can I have your share?\"", "1453443237000": "Jun ignores the twins. She thinks, like before in St. James' Boutique, that something seems amiss. Slowing putting the ecstasy-inducing ribs down, she suddenly becomes rather serious. She whispers something to herself.\"Lahspaan, secretly fahmey lu.\" (Fundor tried to teach her adverbs in draconic, but she found it too complex.) The nearby flames would reduce in temperature, ever so subtly, and a paper-thin ward would drape over the area, a few dozen meters in either direction. It was designed to be undetectable, and would allow Jun to sense the magic in her surroundings more easily. Of course the presence of the twins was suspicious enough, but Jun had more or less grown accustomed to them. Her eyes widened however when she noticed a small amalgamation of magic coming from Maelik head, which was suspicious since she heard him explicitly state that he wasn't going to use magic.Without saying anything, Jun backs away and very quietly begins chanting to herself.", "1453447093000": "Jun senses the twins leaving. (Her ward is still active.) She continues to chant silently, occasionally stopping to take deep breaths. Her mana levels are steadily rising, and the ward's strength is slowly increasing as well.There's psionic energy coming from Maelik. It's faint though. What is he up to?", "1453496696000": "Jun's mana levels had just about returned to normal, and so she stopped chanting. She sighed and bit her lower lip. Things were not looking good. Their so-called fist fight had suddenly turned into a magic fight. She could clearly sense magical energies welling up in both of them now. She wasn't too impressed by their current power levels per se, but she knew this was only the beginning. She could sense a large build up in dark energy permeating Maelik's body, and some sort of enchantment surrounding Arya's weapon which was increasing her speed.If she wanted to interfere, she had to decide what element she'd use which could affect both of them equally.Jun clasped her hands together, as if in prayer and began breathing deeply, focusing on an element that could perhaps give them both pause. She looked around to make sure she was sufficiently inconspicuous to not draw attention to herself.The faint hum of psionic energy coming from Maelik didn't seem to be doing anything. She wondered if it was perhaps some sort of scrying spell and maybe someone was watching them.", "1453504918000": "The more Jun breathed in, the more her thoughts and personality would change. Stand firm. Resolve yourself. Don't give in to anyone or anything. Her foot muscles squirmed and twisted against her armor towards the ground. She could feel a strong connection with the rock and dirt beneath her. And thanks to Fundor's training, she became hyper alert to the energy not just with her, but around her. She almost felt like she was communing with the earth.Help me protect my friends.She tried to remain inconspicuous, but the mana levels in her body were beginning to spike. One might even notice a faint verdant glow in her eyes.She continued to monitor the two combatants, still hoping she wouldn't need to interfere.Despite the darkness, her ward let her see at least where the position of the combatants was.", "1453592748000": "Jun began to sweat when she felt Maelik's horrible spell charging. She was familiar with dark energy, but what he was building up was tangibly malicious. She feared the attack could very well be lethal. Arya's spell was no better. She couldn't even begin to understand how light of all things could also feel malicious, but Arya's spell obviously had massive destructive potential.Before either spell could finish charging, Jun would decide she'd had enough. After several breaths and many seconds of charging, a verdant aura erupted from her skin and engulfed her armor. The green energy was earth energy. Jun's physical steadfastness and mental stubbornness increased drastically. The air around her whirled. Her hair was practically blowing itself upright. Her rig was crackling with bolts of mana and there was a high pitched, unearthly screech emanating from her body. \"ENOUGH!\" She cried. She rapidly swung her hands downward. A luminescent, flame-like gush of energy appeared in the air between Arya and Maelik and bored its way into the ground. A split second later Jun swung her arms back up.An enormous block of solid stone, about 20 meters high, 2 meters thick, and 40 meters wide would erupt from the ground right in between Arya and Maelik. The dark grey mass would rip the earth apart as it traveled, causing anyone too close to the wall to lose balance at the tremulous \u00a0ground. It would be unlikely either Maelik's or Arya's spells could penetrate the wall.Not that Jun was done. The energy going into the creation of that wall had been expended, but Jun still had plenty of mana left. She stomped towards the two combatants.\u00a0The verdant aura was gone, but her gauntlet and chains were still still crackling and giving off sparks. \"What happened to a friendly fist fight huh?! What happened to just letting off some steam?! Because both of those spells looked pretty fucking lethal to me!\" She scolded.She was livid, but somewhere in the back of her mind Jun was amused that she was the shortest person there besides Doobie.", "1453606551000": "Jun breathed a sigh of relief. \"Honestly... I'd call it a draw. If both your spells connected you'd both be in a world of hurt. Trust me, I know. I was watching the whole thing with the help of a ward.\"Jun walked up to Maelik. \"Speaking of which...\" Jun waved at Maelik's face comically. \"Hey, is anyone in there? Yoohoo, 'ello?\" She focused a wide open eye ball deep into where she sensed the scrying spell. \"If you're watching this, Hi! It's ok. Fight's over. Maelik's fine.\"Not really expecting a response, Jun shrugged. \"Hey, your fight was entertaining. And you're both really strong. I say you both shake hands so we can get back to dinner.\"", "1453709504000": "\"I see... that makes sense. When I first arrived in Medan, I had read a book about dragons. I never saw a mention of a holy species per-se. The species that came closest was a silver dragon. And well, you're not shiny enough.\" She grinned sheepishly.\"You know, I'm actually really glad you told me your story. I feel like I have a lot of inner demons to face too... mostly jealously, fear, and anger. I'm looking forward to this... but I'm nervous.\"", "1431667635000": "<Enter from the Usque>\"Ok... ok... ok... we got this...\" After a day of climbing (most mountains take a couple of days to climb, but thanks to Jun's teleportation magic, they were able to bypass some difficult ledges easily), they finally made it to what they thought was the entrance to the dragon's layer. It was a rather large cave entrance, and there were many fulgurites in the area, suggesting a great deal of electrical activity. The cave itself smelled like ozone. It was oddly invigorating. Jun felt like a child sneaking out of the house when she peeked into the cave entrance, where she could just make out the sounds of snoring.It's asleep...It's asleep.IT'S ASLEEP!! \"It's asleep!\" She whispered to Camilla and Jill. She thought about how they should best approach this. \"Ok, here's the deal. I have a spell which can make a creature go out of phase, and therefor invisible, for a few seconds. That might be enough time to gather the layout of the lair. Now, Camilla has the same spell sealed in one of her scrolls, but it's not that strong and might last 15 seconds, since I made it a while ago and I've been practicing since then. I can cast a stronger one on one of you, which might last 40 seconds, but it'll cost me more mana.\"Jun thought for a moment.\"Or we can just ambush it, me and Jill, with all the magic we've got, or maybe sneak past it? It IS asleep. But then again we can also wake it up and try to talk to it. So, we've got options. What do you guys think?\"***Just to review, among the choices Jun is offering, Choice A is to have Camilla use her phase scroll and move on to choice B, or just skip to choice B. Choice B is to either wake up the dragon (diplomacy will probably be a big deal), ambush the dragon (combat is everything), or scout further with Jun's spell (athleticism, and stealth if the spell wears off). The consequences of the actions aren't fixed. For example, someone might decide they found the gem and from there try to steal it after the spell wears off with their own stealth ability. Or they could chicken out and try to sneak back and regroup. So basically the choices might lead to a third choice, Choice C.The idea behind mana is that Jun can do whatever the party asks, but will have less to bring to a fight if there is one. So the more stealth we do, the less fighting Jun will be able to do.And of course, Jill and Camilla can offer their own options.", "1431672543000": "\"... That's an option too...\" Jun's eyes dart towards the dark, possessed crow. She definitely did not expect that. She would then turn towards her comrades, waiting for their reactions, both to her brainstorming and the crow's startling appearance and warning.", "1431850104000": "Jun didn't really hesitate. \"Well, I hate to admit it, but I've got the best chance of survival so... me. Camilla, get that shield scroll ready just in case. I'm going in.\"Jun gingerly made her way towards the dragon. She took one of her own scrolls from her bandolier, another shield scroll, and placed it in her hand. While trying not to think of the worst case scenario, Jun approached the massive sleeping creature.\"Excuse me, my lord. Your eminence. Excuse me. Excuse me, my lord, excuse- ugh, YO!\"", "1431904399000": "\"Wait.\" Jun turned around. \"Camilla, don't pull your weapon. We don't wanna alarm him. Just get the scroll ready and stay back. Jill, stay behind and close to her. The shield can save you both in a pinch. Let me talk to it first.\"Jun then turned back to the dragon, hoping they hadn't blown their chances.\"In fact, maybe you guys should kneel to show respect. The shield can give you guys time to arm.\"...\"EXCUSE ME, MY LORD.\"", "1431971092000": "\"Oh wow... umm... forgive me your eminence...\" Jun did her best to remain calm, hoping to create a certain impression with the words she chose. \"This is my first time seeing a dragon up close. You're actually rather handsome-\" She smiled meekly and scratched the back of her head while turning towards her companions. \"Um, sorry, irrelevant.\" Jun scanned the dragon's face for subtle changes to its expression, to determine what effect her words were having, if any, and what to say next.She gave a little bow. \"My name is Jun. Umm, those terrified individuals over there are our motley crew. That's Jill, and that there is Camilla.\" She gestured to them then turned back to the dragon. \"What's your name?\"", "1432183804000": "Jun got the weird feeling she just got rejected. This was worse than when she was 7 years old and that mean boy killed the snail she had given him.Apparently this dragon wasn't into flattery. So she hoped Princess Camilla's tactic would work. Camilla was definitely good. She could see the intimidation and bribery woven into her words. She felt strangely brazen and humble at the same time. A part of her wanted things to go south so she could challenge the overgrown gecko. There was one other concern. By moving forward, Camilla moved herself out of position to protect Jill, which meant Jun herself would have to do it if things went south. Jun began to calculate what strategies she would use if the dragon attacked. The most important thing was that they survive its initial strike.She wished they were on friendly terms so she could explore the expansive darkness in the cave. Jun felt in her chest many strange and wonderful energies permeating the atmosphere. Her fingers were cross as Camilla did her thing.", "1432273369000": "Jun chimed in. \"You can speak for me. I think if me and Jill meant you harm I would have ambushed you instead of waking you up like an idiot. I apologize for that, by the way.\" Jun meekly backed off and allowed them to continue.(Fixed)", "1432449193000": "Jun calmly stepped out of the way and marveled at the creature's blue scales. As the dragon released its lightning she made a note of his lightning's attack range. (She also peered under its legs, idly wondering what a dragon's reproductive organs looked like).As it passed by, she figured negotiations would continue, and seemed to be going well. So on a whim she decided to test out a new spell she was studying. She pulled out a role of parchment and one of the vials of blood from before, which she had made in the ruins, and put a small drop on it. Then she began writing little runes around the parchment.Like her scrolls to Camilla, she intended this to be a helpful gift for the future.", "1432666755000": "Jun looked around for a DNA sample of Jarkoopi. She noticed an old shedded scale on the ground next to her, picked it up, and crumbled it onto the parchment she was working on, just over her own blood sample. Then she began chanting while channeling magical energy into the parchment.Should Jarkoopi become suspicious, she would simply explain that she was preparing a gift for him as a show of good faith, and that a DNA sample was required for the scroll to be used by Jarkoopi.She was still prepared to step in to negotiations, but felt Camilla had everything under control.", "1432793838000": "Jun teleported away and left behind the parchment behind so Jarkoopi could see for himself. \"Forgive me my lord. See for yourself.\" Jun had nothing to hide. She allowed him to see the parchment and its runes, and with his vast knowledge and experience he could easily decipher it. Quite simply it was an emergency call-scroll. If Jarkoopi was ever in danger, he could use the scroll to alert Jun through a vision of his predicament, also allowing Jun to teleport to his location if he so desired. \"Maybe it's a little presumptuous, you're probably far more powerful than I am, but I was hoping it'd make a gesture of good faith since you could just as easily use the scroll to trick me. You could summon me and kill me under false pretenses, perhaps for your amusement or because you need mage's blood for a spell.\" Jun looked at him straight in the eye. \"I get bored easily, and I'm too brazen for my own good. Forgive me.\" She bowed, and allowed Jarkoopi to see the parchment in full view.Jun wanted to add one more thing, something she meant sincerely. \"I sense good in you Jarkoopi. I'm not saying that to flatter you. After all, being a good being has its drawbacks. It makes one naive and vulnerable and idealistic, and depending on the time period significantly shortens ones lifespan. But none-the-less it's the truth.\"", "1433210494000": "Jun weighed the options. \"Well, if anyone's gonna fight you, it's gonna be me, and I dunno if you've noticed but I kinda like you.\"  Jun smiled weakly. \"So i'd rather we not choose that option. What do you mean by accompanying us? Do you think we'll just borrow it or do you wanna make sure we hide or use it responsibly?\"", "1433255841000": "\"So, trade, kill, or hang out with a friendly dragon. You drive a hard bargain WHAT ARE YOU KIDDING ME? SURE! COME WITH US! Er, I mean... if my companions agree that is...\" Jun's face turned red at her own enthusiasm. But it wasn't every day you could make friends with a dragon.It definitely did not appear as though they were going to fight, and for that Jun was relieved. Although, she received the strangest feeling of disappointment from her hip. She found herself mentally apologizing to her club, strange as that sounds.", "1433558783000": "Jun nodded. \"YES! Thank you so much Jarkoopi.\" She then turned to Camilla. \"So where to next?\"", "1453785769000": "Jun sighed. \"Well, it wouldn't be training Jun if she didn't almost die...\" Jun smirks and takes the rope and the cloth. Under her breath she muttered \"I know right?\" as a bit of a throw-back to her almost losing her mind via Lum'Valia's \"mind split\" training. She finds a secluded spot behind a rock and undresses herself. When she's done putting on the cloth she hands all her equipment to Lum'Valia, including her precious rig.\"Arya, do you know anything about climbing mountains? I'm not much of an expert.\"", "1453871392000": "Jun cracks her knuckles. \"Ok... Well, there is a mountain close to where I live. When I was little me and my friends would try to find ourselves trilobite fossils. But... it's been a while.\"Jun begins to climb up the mountain.*Cue Rocky theme*There was cracking of bones, gnashing of teeth. Her cotton robe was drenched in sweat. Her skin was dry and cracked. Still, she soldiered on. Her heart beat so hard that it was audible in her ears. But her determination was such that she used the very sound itself to motivate her ascent up what was her greatest foe yet.Pretty soon her muscles felt like they were on fire. Her cloth was drenched in sweat. In her mind she could hear her other selves cheering on. She would show this mountain who was boss. She would never give in. This mountain would become her bitch. With each and every agonizing step, each rock she hooked, her passion for climbing the mountain grew. Climb it! Climb it hard! Claw and pound your ass up the mountain. Conquer it! Make love to it! Let your passion carry you to the stars!Almost there, almost there... ALMOST THERE!\"YES, I DID IT!\"Jun had made it 17 feet up the mountain and was now catching her breath on a small overpass.", "1453923497000": "Jun only now notices the path and smacks herself in the face.\"Coming.\"Arya definitely seemed like she knew what she was doing. Jun watched her movements closely and tried to learn from her. The further they got up the mountain, the greater the difference in their physical ability would show. Not that Jun was in terrible shape, but she simply couldn't compare to someone who was used to training in heavy armor.As her breathing became noticeably labored, she said \"Sorry if I'm slowing you down.\"", "1453950875000": "Jun catches her breath and thinks. \"Well, we have rope. I don't suppose we can make makeshift shoes...\" Jun shrugged. \"Staying together for warmth and using each other as windshields, holding hands...\" Jun listed all the possible ways she could think of to help prevent frostbite and make the climb easier.The more she thought about it, the more the idea of frostbite gave her chills (no pun intended). She instinctive folded her hands into her armpits to warm them up...\"Huh... Kekeke...\" Jun snorted and snickered. \"How about this? If we lose feeling in our toes, we'll warm them up in each other's armpits.\" It was a stupid idea but Jun couldn't think of any reason why it wouldn't actually work.", "1453961306000": "Jun continued to soldier on, trying to complain as little as possible. Arya was starting to grow on her. At first she had pegged her for being somewhat belligerent, but really she could be quite kind.The more they progressed up the mountain, the harder each step became. It was reaching the point where Jun was wiggling her toes with each step they took to make sure they still had feeling in them. To top it all off, the air was getting thinner.A nasty little voice in her head began to speak. What are you doing? You can use magic. Cast a fire spell. Use a light construct to carry you to the top. Make it warmer. You're dying you fool.To Jun's amusement, her two other internal voices also spoke up. Who invited you? Get out of here you bitch. Yah, you're not helping!\u00a0The nasty voice responded. Who are you calling a bitch, bitch? I'm not the one that called Jun unattractive.As her inner voices argued, she chuckled audibly. A part of her wondered if Arya would think she was losing her mind due to lack of oxygen, or if she had simply remembered something funny that happened to her.At least they were getting closer to the top.", "1454117786000": "Jun wasn't fairing any better. Having a more petite body than Arya meant she was losing heat more quickly.  She kept her hands in her armpits and tried to curl her toes as often as she could, but it was barely working. The temptation to use magic was getting stronger and stronger, to the point where she had to consistently talk herself away from doing it. \"Must... fairly... no... cheating... mustn't...\" Her breaths became sharp and short as she desperately tried to not lose body heat through her lungs.\"Why... why...\" Coherent sentences weren't coming out. What she was trying to ask was why were they doing this, for as the hours went by she was starting to have trouble remembering their goal. From her perspective Arya's form was wobbling. The ice was pulsing. Her vision was becoming more clouded.\"No... no...\" If Arya turned around (she would have no reason to though) she might see Jun's eyes start to glow red as her body instinctively welled up mana in preparation to use a spell. However, Jun steeled herself and grimaced as she beat the mana back. She would do this without magic, even if it killed her... which it might, since disorientation and mumbled speech were signs of hypothermia.After a while though, Jun would start to feel inexplicably better. She even stopped shivering. In fact, she almost felt hot. A part of her wanted to remove her clothing and sprint to the top of the mountain naked. \"I... I...\" Her pace started to quicken and some lucidity returned. Then a thought occurred to her. Why was she feeling this way? She was sure she wasn't using magic...In that moment of lucidity, she remembered some of the medical knowledge\u00a0that her father taught her.Oh no... Suddenly she called out to Arya. \"Arya... we need... to... go faster... faster... please!\"", "1454123047000": "Jun's final burst of strength did the trick. She was even able to help Arya make it to the hot spring, which she immediately jumped into. Using what little awareness she had left, she positioned herself in a comfortable sitting position. \"Hey, Arya... make sure I don't... drown.\"She blacked out.", "1454224357000": "\"Wait... wait... Ma'sum... it's not what it looks like... Wait, you both wanna... Calico... wait wait your turn...\" Jun was obviously dreaming. There was a stupid grin on her face. \"Wait, Harlen... it's ok... you'll all get a chance... Oh, wow, Ma'sum, I had no idea you were into that...\" Her stupid grin widened. \"Sure... just need... leather belt... oh... no not those... those will hurt... you want it to hurt? Ok...\"This went on for several minutes. \"Oh... oh god... where did you learn how to do that...\" After a few more minutes her voice changed. \"Wait... no come back... what do you mean I'm unattractive... wait... what... Arya?... why her?\" Jun began to stir. Then-\"WHAT DO YOU MEAN I'M TOO SHORT!?\" She gasped and then woke up. She was very disappointed. Hopefully she didn't wake anyone else up.After changing into some dry clothing, Jun looked around the cave, finally able to appreciate how comfortable it was. She of course saw the food. Looking back at Arya and Lummie, she decided there was no harm in helping herself. She quickly grabbed a plate and began shoveling copious amounts of mashed potatoes, veggies, and slices of turkey onto her plate.", "1454376436000": "Jun nodded and went back to eating.When she had her fill, she would wait patiently for Arya to wake up, occasionally casting a fire spell so the rest of the food didn't get cold.", "1454469617000": "Jun looked relieved when Arya finally woke up. \"It's no trouble.\" She said with a slight twitch. She tried to play it off and rolled her shoulders and stretched her arms. \"Gave me an excuse to practice you know? Heh. Umm Lummie said we should go through the portal when we're ready to, become enlightened and stuff. I... figured it would be better if we go together you know?\" She folded her arms and gave a timid, insincere smile.Jun tried not to make it obvious, but the truth is her near brush with death had caused her to be greatly afraid of what awaited her. Physically she was ok, but mentally she felt a little... off, more so than usual.", "1460680448000": "Jun looked over at Arya, then at the seal, curiously. \"Is there anything we can do to prepare?\"", "1460831733000": "Jun nodded and, after figuring out what direction clockwise and counter-clockwise are (in the Land-Tiler's expanse they don't use clocks very often...) steps into position. She places her hands together and begins to breath deeply.Slowly, with each breath, she draws on holy energy, becoming one with it. A variation of a technique she learned on her travels, becoming one with an element would allow her to channel that element's power more efficiently. She hoped this would help her make up the different.With each step she took on the circle and with each breath she took, a faint glowing aura around her would start to become more and more clear.", "1463472745000": "<Enter from the Chalet>Jun flew in front the chalet, carefully considering what she was about to ask. She knew under the right circumstances Lum'Valia could fight. But she had never fought side by side with her before. She didn't know if asking her was the right thing to do. Her homeland and her people, her family, her father most likely, were on the front lines.No, she needed to do this.\"Lum'Valia? Master Lummie? Are you here?\" She called out. Blackbean waited just outside.", "1463527087000": "Jun responded well to the nuzzle at first. But as she was about to make her request, she suddenly paused. Without a word she stepped over to a comfortable rock and sat on it. Her face collapsed into her hands and stayed there for a while.\"I can't do this... What have I done?\" With a heavy, fruitless sigh she turned to Lum'Valia. \"I haven't even done that much. I don't know why I feel this way but, I'm just... This is only going to be the beginning isn't it? All this responsibility. I don't know if I can handle it.\"After another, somewhat more fruitful sigh, she finally managed to utter what she came to say. \"I need your help. One of the other nations, Aaedan, has been completely... destroyed.\" The gravity of the situation hadn't really dawned on her until now. \"It's worse than Goraia, so much worse. A necromancer, I don't know how he did it, but somehow the entire population's been turned into undead. It's all gone... My homeland is right on the border and they're in a state of all out war against them. I'm not sure but I'm guessing my dad is on the front lines. He'd be the most effective leader against the undead and he leads the mounted mages. I've, the Black Tower is sending me to try to stop the necromancer, along with a small party. They asked me to ask you to come... Lum'Valia I don't know if I can do this anymore...\"Once again her head collapsed into her hands.", "1463552357000": "Jun leans against Lum'Valia's head. She almost wants to take a nap. She holds a hand up and a couple of small light constructs appear. They are little figurines of herself, her parents, her grandmother, and her childhood boyfriend. She pokes her other hand at them and just stares longingly. \"Why did I have to pick such a complex life for myself? All the things I've done, and I still feel like it's not good enough. I have to be the hero. But it's just... It's too much. I'm starting to wish I had never left home Lum'Valia.\"She closed her fists and the light constructs disappeared. \"Ildesias and Xel'rath are going too. I don't know who else is going. But this necromancer, if he's powerful enough to destroy an entire kingdom... and if anyone's next, it's gonna be my homeland. Lum'Valia, please come with me. Not even because the Black Tower wants you there, but because... I don't think I can do this without a close friend. I... I'm too tired to do it alone...\"Jun stared off at the walls now. \"The truth is, we might have to use lethal force. You don't have to come if you don't want to.\"", "1463589851000": "A warm smile appaered on Jun's face, though she was still somewhat reticent. After a moment, she stood up to climb on Lum'Valia's back. \"Thank you Lummie.\"She called out to Blackbean. \"Hey, how about someone else give us both a ride for once?\"With a thought, Blackbean shrank down to the size of a normal crow and hopped on Jun's shoulder. Jun took the time to pet it carefully, feeling more affectionate than usual. Blackbean seemed to understand.\"Welp, let's go save the world and... stuff...\" Jun rubbed her temples.<Exit>", "1463471785000": "<Enter from Black Tower>Jun was in a hurry. She had to reach Lum'Valia as quickly as possible and get her to help fight the Aaedanian's undead force.As she towards the chalet's exit, she might spot Artemis in passing. She decided to keep their conversation as brief as possible and wouldn't even pause long enough to get socially obligated to stand in one place..\"OhheyArtemislongtimenoseeheyjustsoyouknowI'msorryforturningdownyoursandNaoki'ssolicitationsforsexthatwholethingwasveryawkwardandcaughtmeoffguardbutIwantyoutoknowIthinkyou'reveryattractiveandhaveawonderfulpersonalityandIwholeheartedlyapproveofyouandNoaki'sculturalpracticeseventhoughIchosenottoparticipatebutyahanywaysIneedtogomypeoplemightbeintroubleandIhavetogetLum'ValiatohelpfightasuperpowerfulnecronamcerohonemorethingIapologizeforspreadingrumorsthatyouhaveasharkfinokbyenow!\"Finally Jun was out of earshot. When she reached the frigid air of the outside world, she'd release the shrinking spell on Blackbean, climb on to him, and fly towards Lum'Valia's lair.<Exit>", "1465330202000": "<Enter from teleporter in Gauldin>\"BLARGH WHHYYYYY?\" Jun wined as appeared with a flash. The otherwise dull room was lit up with empowered glyphs which then faded back into obscurity. Jun stumbled out of the room, exhausted, and into the bright looking antechamber. She was still in her blue sun dress adapted to Carmela's weather, so naturally she felt out of place in the royal decor that Madame Naoki was so fond of surrounding herself in. It all seemed so dumb to her now. All this pretention, all this waste, all this, this lace.She strode over to a satin-lined chair and sat down, pouting. Her chin rested on her palms, scrunching her face together thereby greatly enhancing said pout. Her sudden animosity towards the decor wasn't personal, just a result of her foul mood. The queen was absolutely, positively unwilling to divulge any information about the crystal, and so Jun knew she might be forced to take more drastic measures, or abandon her mission. Right now she just wanted to work up the courage to speak to Empress Naoki  .Blackbean was sitting on her shoulder. He gave a little warble. \"Yah I know I know.\" She pulled out a little piece of dried jerky for him to nibble on. As she stared at the bird, a thought occurred to her. It was a mischievous thought, something a child might come up with, but a thought none-the-less.", "1465461107000": "\"Madame Naoki!\" Jun raised her chin from her hands and straightened her back. Wide-eyed, she said \"Well that was fast.\"At least she's in a good mood, she thought. \"I'm... I'm doing good I just...\" Her facade quickly fell and she returned to her lassitude, her chin returning to her hands. \"I've got some bad news. And I need your advice.\" There was a brief pause as Jun got over her apprehension. \"I don't think I'm going to be able to get your crystal. The queen is absolutely unwilling to part with the crystal, at all. She's completely closed off to the idea of bartering and she won't even allow anyone to see it. It's strange, because she implied during our conversation that she isn't even aware of any special properties it might have...\"The more she spoke the more she actually thought about it. It was a real puzzle indeed. \"I... I got the impression it has some sort of sentimental value. It doesn't make sense that someone would guard something so jealously that has no practical or unknown practical use... huh...\"After a few more seconds of staring at the wall opposite the two, Jun shook her head and turned to Naoki. \"So yah, unless you want me to steal it or be an accomplice to stealing it, which...\" She grimaced and turned to Blackbean. \"I have some ideas about that. I'd need some time and maybe some tutoring from a transfiguration mage, some kind of gift to present the queen, and another telepathy crystal for my friend here.\" Blackbean cawed. Jun scratched his chin. \"He wouldn't mind, but I wouldn't feel right about stealing the crystal. But with the resources I just listed me and Blackbean could possibly help located it... if you really want me to that is.\"The reluctance was practically oozing out of Jun's eyes.", "1465499544000": "Jun leaned back on her chair and vacated all the air in her lungs at once. Her eyes rolled into the back of her head and she folded her arms. Her posture was distinctly un-lady like. In fact, she wasn't even bothering to cross her legs, a fact Naoki may or may not mixed feelings towards. \"Uhhh... eh. I just have a lot on my mind. The Inferno Assembly, my homeland, my boy-\"Jun paused and thought back to the incident in the Moonlight Eclipse. \"b-b-b...boy boy boy boiling... cauldron... that I left... at my place... in Goraia...\" She said all this in a monotone voice. \"Because I boil things a lot you see. It was my grandmother's cauldron and I miss it... terribly...\"Jun tapped her fingers together and, surprisingly unruffled, thought about how to continue the conversation. \"You know, now that I think about it, I don't really do anything for fun. I learned a bit of cooking from Rowena Fletcher, and I like to read a lot, but... I'm not enjoying life as much as I thought I would. I was so naive, leaving home. I was excited, hungry, now... now I just want to...\"She reached up and petted Blackbean again, who was staring intently at Naoki's chocolate. \"What do you do for fun Miss Naoki?\"", "1465591694000": "Most of the tension disappears when Madame Naoki teases her about her cauldron. Her seriousness melted into a salacious grin. \"You know, it's a very good cauldron, although the size of the cauldron takes a while to get used to, particularly the girth. Big, thick cauldrons are a little overrated. Although, they can be fun to polish.\"She turned to Naoki and chuckled. The joke had gone on long enough.\"You're amazing, I never give you enough credit. I'll still try to help with that crystal... Oh! Would ice work?! The lead elder of my tribe can make ice constructs. And he's super powerful, much more powerful than I am. If there was a way to set the ice so that it doesn't melt, like Gauldin's rune crafting or something, and what the hell am I doing?\" Jun hung her head in shame. \"You just said, and I just said, that I should relax, and three seconds later I'm thinking about work again. I'm hopeless.\"Without really thinking, Jun leaned in and placed her head on Naoki's shoulder, a platonic gesture of course. She gave a slight chuckle. \"I'm terrible at archery, absolutely abysmal. My mom always tried to get me into it but I just never got the hang of it. I don't know if I told you I was a book worm growing up. I spent most of my time reading out in the field. There were times I felt like I didn't have any other friends aside from my books and the earth's magical energies... Apparently my dad was the same way growing up...\"Jun's face lit up and suddenly stood up straight. \"You know what I miss doing? Gardening! I used to help my dad grow fruits and vegetables and flowers all the time. And now that I think about it, I haven't done it in forever. It's something I'd recommed to you too, you know, since we're suggesting things and what-not. Getting back in touch with nature is something that everyone should do once in a while.\" Jun sat back down, reached over, and flicked the very edge of the furs of Naoki's tail. \"Especially you, madame. I don't know much about your people but I get the feeling you have a natural affinity for such things.\"Jun raised an eyebrow. \"Lady Naoki, I don't believe I've asked you this before. What was your family like?\"", "1465685198000": "\"Narslimmus?\" Jun looks at Naoki inquisitively. \"I think I've heard of that before. It's a strange, semi-carnivorous plant that consumes slime molds and generates mana. They're very hard to cultivate. Kate must be really good. I'd like to meet her sometime.\"Jun shrugged. \"My dad always taught me to respect the differences between people. He told me that some people have very rigid, analytical minds and some people are more intuitive. Both are viable ways of learning to cultivate plants, and approach life really. I think my dad has a copy of a series of scrolls you might be interested in. It explains the mathematics behind plant growth, but it's not exactly light reading. I think by chapter two you're already expected\u00a0to know something about osmotic pressure, gas constants, and the tensile force of water in the xylem channels. So you could apply numbers to plant growth but it's the very definition of esoteric knowledge.\"Her head drooped slightly in embarrassment. \"I made multiple attempts to read the scrolls when I was a child. I really wanted to learn how to pronounce all the big words. Sadly I never finished it. My dad's practically memorized it. He gets on my case about it sometimes. Haha.\" After a brief paused, she said, \"I don't think I started taking a more intuitive approach to life until after my grandmother died. Can't say if it was for the best or not... I suppose it doesn't matter. People should do what they feel like doing right? And I definitely feel like taking up gardening, maybe when the world dies down a little.\"Jun contemplated Naoki's comments on her breeding for a while. \"You know, since I left the expanse, I've made friends with a human mercenary, a bird man business owner, a deity-possessed emperor, three dragons, a kobold, a vampire, a void entity, two demons, and old woman with super-strength. I feel a bond of kinship with all of them even though I still feel loyalty to my homeland, and of course to you. I think... or is it I feel, I can hardly tell the difference anymore... you being what you are, not quite like everyone else but not all that different, actually puts you in a unique position. It could be your destiny as the leader of Isra to promote kinship among all peoples. Imagine saying you have a little bit of everyone in you but not bound to anyone but yourself. You could have the largest family in the world and be virtually incorruptable.\"Blackbean fluttered down towards Naoki's arm and maded pecking motions towards the chocolate. Jun smirked. \"He's not an earthly crow, but chocolate would still give him gas. I'd rather not deal with that.\" Jun leaned forward and gently batted his chin away from the cup with her index finger.\"You know what, all this philosophizing is making me tired. Do you have time for a trip to the sauna?\"", "1465688105000": "Jun's face ran cold.Mother?! Wait, Naoki is a mom?! WHAT?!\"Oh! Hi!\" Jun stood straight up out of her chair and reached out her hand to shake Skarlet's. She wore the biggest grin she could muster in such a short amount of time. \"I'm Jun, I'm one of Naoki's contracted employees. I've... heard-\"Jun had to restrain herself from saying the words \"surprisingly little about you.\"\"I've heard so much about-\"Wait a second. What if her existence is a secret that Naoki doesn't like to discuss for political reasons? What if she could be the target of assassination or kidnapping? What if they don't get along? Or what if they actually do get along and I just forgot her mentioning of her? What If Naoki gets mad at me? What do I do? What do I say?!\"...about-\"It was fortunate that Jun had her crystal turned off or Naoki's poor pre-frontal cortext would be overheating with Jun's internal panic. How she maintained a straight face was anyone's guess.\"-about the.. saunas here! And I was just about to go check them out. It's funny because I have a living quarters here but I just haven't had time... been busy... you know?\"... Jun stopped shaking Skarlet's hand.", "1466132782000": "Jun unconsciously shrugged. Only Naoki would understand. But it was a slight gesture so Skarlet probably wouldn't notice.What matters is that you have a family now Madame Naoki.\u00a0She smiled for real.Jun was excited to check out the sauna for the first time, so excited that she forgot that she was going to be half naked in front of her employer and the employer's daughter. But hey, what could go wrong?As they step around the wall divider and into the preparation room, Jun suddenly realizes why she probably should have been hesitant after all. Changing in front of others wasn't that big of a deal. Her family wasn't prudish, though they weren't overly liberal either. Changing wouldn't be an issue. But there was one thing she would have trouble with.Scars. They weren't especially numerous, nor did they render her naked body grotesque (Vaelar\u00a0certainly didn't seem to mind it), but she was still self-conscious about them. Jun would ultimately ensure that she was perfectly hidden behind a curtain while the others changed into a towel. Sigh.***When it was time to actually enter the sauna, she walked along the concentric stone seating area until she got to the side opposite the entrance. There she sat back and tried to relax. Her posture was a bit odd though. Her legs were tightly held together, as were her hands, almost as if she was cold. She leaned back and braced herself for the hot steam.I'm being silly. No one is looking at them. They're not that big a deal. They're not...", "1466193441000": "Jun's eyes suddenly fluttered open with life.\"You do?\" At first she looked at the scar with wonder, but as the seconds went by she smiled. Somewhat shyly she removed her towel. (She wasn't quite as voluptuous as the others, but at least all that walking around kept her fit. Her skin was a little darker around her face and arms. Her limbs were toned but not bulky. She had gained a tiny bit of weight since settling down and working for Naoki, but it wasn't really noticeable to anyone but her. A somewhat pedestrian body perhaps compared to the other two, but she was proud of it.)Now all the scars were in full view. They really weren't that bad.She started to point to the various scars and explain them to Scarlet. \"I got this one fighting a titan in Gomrath. This one here's from a wraith near Medan. I got this one in a friendly magic duel, and this one was from when I was in a volcanic cavern. I got this one from when I was little. It was a dumb incident with my cousin and a bear. I don't really like talking about it. Oh,this one is from...\"She went on like this for a bit.\"Sorry, I'm really weird about my scars. I'm proud of them, but I'm also worried people will judge me for keeping them, so I feel insecure sometimes about revealing my body.\"She leaned back again and finally took in the warmth of the sauna. Small beads of sweat and condensed moisture were beginning to form on her face. \"So what's your story Skarlet?\"", "1466279276000": "Jun's eyes occasionally shift to Naoki as she speaks. Given what happened at their... initial encounter, Jun was aware that the removal of her towel might illicit a slight twitch from that tail of hers. But she was so focused on regaling Skarlet with the story of each scar that she didn't bother to think about it until after they were done.\"I hope so too Skarlet.\"Of course Madame Naoki was the pinnacle of professionalism, so Jun should have expected no less than pertinent political ponderings.\"Well, now that we have a chance to talk about it... In a lot of ways the expanse isn't that different from any other civilization. We have something that we are proud of and would assert ourselves with against anyone. Some nations have their military, others have their religion, and we have our agriculture. And like other nations the expanse wants to protect its way of life.\"Jun pondered for a bit, staring at the glowing green rocks at the center of the sauna. \"I'd say that, at our very core, we always want to maintain who we are. We're an agricultural people who wants to maintain a stable population and live in harmony with the earth. We don't want that to change. But I also think we're drawn to the allure of novelty, of new technologies and concepts, and that we're willing to compromise in order to obtain those things. From what I understand, part of why the land-tillers were so accepting of the Belrowans was because they saw a chance to obtain enchanted weapons and farming tools, metal weapons which we don't have the infrastructure to produce en masse. We allied with Gauldin so we could learn how to use anti-magic and wards. We get luxury items and military support from Isra. Same used to be the case with the Phoenix Imperium before they fell into disarray.\"\"I think, friendships like that can be addicting, and also put us in a precarious position. We want to be friends with everyone, and share our knowledge with everyone. We also want to obtain things from everyone. And I think this creates a certain vulnerability in us... In a way, we're easy to exploit. The Phoenix Imperium made us develop a mandatory military program. Having a standing army was a novel concept that appealed to us. But because of it we felt obligated to help out in whatever wars they wanted to fight, like with Goraia and Aaedan. Deep down inside I'm sure our elders are itching to show off our full military might at the request of someone else. It's almost like we're children trying to show the older children that we can play ball as well as them. Naturally if someone we look up to asks us to be on their team, we'd say yes.\"This conversation would take place just before the battle of the undead in Aaedan, which was also the largest military operation in the Land-Tiller's history. So in a sense Jun's assessment was correct. The elders were indeed all too eager to demonstrate their military power when given the chance.\"I dunno. I feel like, we want to be who we are, but at the same time not feel inferior to anyone else. And as a people, I feel we have great potential. But sometimes I wonder if we're really ready for the world of politics. We're used to a straight forward dialogue. We don't like backdoor deals and political games. We're not used to them. And I don't want my people to become pawns in exchange for some new toys. We take for granted the fact that Isra and Gauldin and Belrow want to be trading partners and friends with us, and might even be willing to help us grow. But who knows what these nations will ask of us in return?\"Jun slowly raised her palms to her face and looked at them. She then balled them into twin fists. \"My dream is to become powerful enough to protect the expanse, just like my grandmother and Elder Havador. And so I say this as, well I guess you'd call it a patriot. We're a naive people. As a cultural entity, we've been around for thousands of years. but as a political entity working on an international scale, we're even younger than Isra.\"Jun looked straight into Madame Naoki's eyes. \"And I'm scared for our future.\"", "1466363263000": "Jun decided to take a cue from Naoki and also lie down. The sauna started to feel really good, although she had the feeling it was wise not to fall asleep here. As she brought herself face down onto the bench, she winced slightly and then giggled. The air was so warm that by comparison the bench surface felt a little cold. This gave her sensitive areas a slight chill.\"I appreciate everything you just said Madame Naoki. It's funny, I never realized how much I cared about my homeland before, but the truth is all of this craziness started with a desire to want to protect it.\" She lay the side of her head on her arms and once again took to observing the glowing rocks, then Madame Naoki's tail, then the overheating Skarlet-That's when she realized something... Skarlet had no feline features. Perhaps a tad impolitely, Jun suddenly eyed Skarlet's body. She was paler than Naoki, and far more voluptuous. She was rather tall and, how old was she? Naoki could be older than she looked but they almost appeared the same age. And there was something else, something that reminded her of... of... Roy Fletcher?\"Skarlet, if you don't mind me asking, if Naoki was your mother, who was your father?\"", "1466659185000": "\"Ah.\" Jun gave a very blase response to hearing that Skarlet was a vampire. Nothing surprised her anymore.After a few minutes Jun found herself dozing off. She shook herself awake and slid off the bench. \"I enjoyed our talk Madame Naoki but if you don't mind I'd like to retire to my quarters and rest.\" She stretched. When she saw Artemis' naked form, she chuckled. Everyone here had a unique body type. It was nice, appreciating things like this... It might have been nicer if she wasn't the least well-endowed person in the bunch. Artemis was comparable, but she looked like she could break Jun in half with those muscles.Oh well.\"Til we meet again. It was nice meeting you Skarlet.\" Jun walked passed them towards the exit, making one last backwards glance to check something.Nope, definitely no shark fin, she thought to herself.<Exit>", "1514277898000": "... Jun had brought milk and cookies. She assumed wine would have been more appropriate for an adult sleep over but... well, you know.She arrived at the teleporting circle wearing some casual grey robes and bringing her tasty friendship offering in a leather satchel. The cookies were also wrapped in wax paper.Not until she was in the common room that she suddenly recalled that her vampire friend was a vampire and was therefore probably lactose tolerant.\"... I mean... Maybe vampires still have taste buds.\" She said to herself hopefully.", "1514687475000": "Feeling relaxed and relieved, Jun took a load off on the nearest couch. \"It was no trouble. I like bringing snacks to things. Though I guess next time I should bring blood sausage or something... No offense.\"She put her hands behind her head and leaned back. She thought back to the last time they spoke, at the festival of Rondon.\"I guess I'm still curious about your second self, and how you guys wound up changing bodies. Also if you like blood sausage or not.\"", "1515310785000": "\"I see...\"\"Oh... Poor Celine.\"\"Huh...\"Jun was attentive to the story, almost forgetting why she had asked.That's so strange. So you were born with a new soul after Celine left this body. You were born through your brother.\"She sighed and stretched out on the couch, her hands staring up pensively at the ceiling. \"It makes me wonder what death and the world beyond are really like. Most people in my clan believe that our souls return to the light, and then come back as new people. Because life is about learning and... Something something something. I was never very religious. But I've seen some things, things that really make me wonder...\"After a few seconds she shook herself out of her trance. \"Oh yah, this thing you wanted to try with me. What's that about?\" She smiled genially.", "1515569192000": "\"Enter into my dreams. That sounds... That sounds...\" The wrinkles on Jun's forehead strained desperately to adequately describe the sensation. \"Ok let me try to explain how it feels. I'm imagining like a hand feeling around inside my chest cavity for some reason. It's like, kinda... violating.\"Jun stared up at the ceiling for a moment.\"It sounds weirdly appealing. Let's do it.\" She sat up and looked at Skarlet with a grin. \"What do I gotta do? Besides, you know, falling asleep and actually dreaming.\"", "1515725212000": "\"Oh, that does sound kinda disturbing. So it's gotta be a nightmare...\"Jun folded her arms and frowned in thought. She didn't remember her nightmares very well, but she felt like nightmares were the most personal things a person could have. And yet, the prospect of exploring a brand new type of magic was way too tempting.\"Let's go with the inducing nightmare on me thing. If nothing else maybe I can learn to do that too. I'm not very good at mental manipulation. I'm familiar with psionics as an element, but mostly I can just move things with my mind and... break stuff. Subtlety isn't my strong suit. Hehe.\"Oddly the prospect of having a nightmare itself didn't bother her. Dreams were alien things in the waking world. Nightmares were hard to appreciate unless they were either chronic, or one was in the middle of having one.", "1516074404000": "\"I could use some spicy food actually. Hmm...\"...\"Oh boy, yah, my grandmother. That's a loaded topic.\" She had a content smile on her face and she leaned back on the couch.\"Her name was Lynx. She was, she was very cool. She was kind of a complex person, hard to predict. She was a real veteran, all kinds of battles. And she was strong, stronger than anyone I've ever met.\"Jun raised her hand and summoned a light construct. It was a crystal statue of a woman in robes, of similar build to Jun. The woman had a foot forward and a very determined postured. \"We have the same hairstyle.\" She grinned, pointing at her shoulder-length, rounded hair. \"Sorry, I'm not crazy. I mean, I'm a little crazy but-\" She shook her head. \"This is what the statue of her looks like, the one in the Elder's Council. All the Chaos Mages are there. She's the most realistic looking one though, because chaos mages only appear every few centuries. So the tales of the others become greatly exaggerated. Like, one of the older ones has flaming wings and crap.\"She closed her fist and shut off the construct. \"I went to school in the Guardian Tower, a big spire near the council. That's where people with magic potential go to learn things. My grandmother wasn't my main teacher, but she was my tutor. And I was obsessed with magic and with getting stronger and stronger. I felt a strong sense of obligation to keep up with her, even though I knew it was impossible. Chaos mages are kind of like chosen ones. You just don't get to be one. Oh but I was obsessed. It was why I left the tribe. I had to be the strongest. I had to be the best... But, that was a mistake. My obsession with surpassing her did a lot of psychological harm to me. It actually almost made me evil. If it hadn't been for Lum'Valia, I might have gone down a very dark path. So it's lucky I met her.\"She sighed. \"I think it was the void she left when she died. She died suddenly. I was about 12 I think. They say it was natural causes but I never believed it. Later I found out her husband resurrected her and used her as a kind of super weapon. I think he was jealous and power hungry. But somehow she broke out of it. Anyways, while I was training with Lum'Valia, I got a glimpse of the afterlife. Long story. But I met her. And she, I dunno, she convinced me to let it go, to follow my own path. I think her abrupt death made me feel like the only way I could be close to her was to keep getting stronger. I'm glad to be rid of that burden though. I feel much better about my life.\"That's why I didn't bother looking for her at the festival. I always believed that souls reincarnated when they died. I just didn't think she'd be there anymore. But, I don't think I know much about the afterlife at all. Maybe I was wrong. Hopefully, she doesn't hold it against me. Heh.\"Her eyes shifted to Skarlet. \"Sorry, I was rambling.\"", "1516431870000": "The construct would feel like warm glass.Jun leaned forward and steepled her fingers, focusing on the lore she had learned as a child and what she had learned recently. \"Oh, well, it's a bit complicated. They're called chaos mages because they're instigators of change. Usually, they change regimes, the status quo, whatever needs changing. What they do, they usually do for the greater good. Where they come from? Well, funny thing is, this was a mystery up until about a year ago, when the elves and Va'nei appeared.\"It all started thousands of years, you know, the way most of these stories do. Our people were primitives who were fleeing from an ancient race of sapient reptilians, the kiraxians I think they were called. We arrived in the Expanse and hid there. Turns out the place was already occupied by elves. Our ancestors were simple folk who were sensitive to changes in the climate. We knew how to live in harmony with the land. We had a knack for it I guess. Turns out we had a lot in common with the elves, so they let us stay. And they drove off the kiraxians with powerful magic. Fast forward a few centuries and Va'nei shows up. She was so impressed with our efforts that she blessed the land with a powerful magical presence. It's like a contract we have with the land. As long as we live in harmony with it, it'll bless us. This magical force is apparently what chooses the chaos mages. Chaos mages have the ability to manipulate every element. Their signature ability is the power to cast light and dark magic simultaneously. No one else in my tribe can do that. They're supposed to be chosen for their spiritual potential, their capacity to understand what nature connects us with the elements, and master those natures within themselves. Basically, they're supposed to be complete, enlightened people I guess.\"...After her long-winded explanation, Jun was famished.\"Oooh! This looks good!\" After a precautionary sniff, Jun immediately began to devour the slithery sustenance. Its odd appearance didn't offend her at all, not when she had eaten fried bee larva before. \"Mmmm! Oh, you say they're intelligent?\" Jun looked at the deceased and tasty master of camouflage with some sadness. \"... It's so good though...\" She grimaced for a few seconds. \"Thank you for your sacrifice.\" She started eating it again.", "1516832175000": "Jun made a sad \"mmm\" sound as she continued to eat. \"Still, it sounds like something that would make a good pet instead of food. Maybe I'll try to catch an octopus and turn it into my friend. Hopefully, Blackbean doesn't get jealous. Sorry, my pet giant crow. You might have seen him in Rondon... though he probably wasn't giant at the time.\"In response to her comment about poweful beings, she replied, \"Well yah, not all powerful beings are hostile. Some of the biggest dragons in the world are friendly, as are some powerful mages. But, you know, it's still good to be careful. Jarkoopi... he's... he's ok.\"As Jun started tiring, she sensed Skarlet flirting with her. She just sort of leaned back serenely on the couch, her lips slightly pressed together.Oh crap... No... not her too! Am I the only heterosexual female in Isra? What the hell? What do I do? Oh god I can't shoot her down? Can I? She's the Empress' daughter. Oh god, oh god oh god what do I do... uh, maybe, maybe I can make something up. Maybe, maybe maybe... the octopus. It was too spicy. I'm not feeling well. I'm-[ Hissss! \u00a0] Skarlet straddles her. Jun's calm facade breaks and she appears frightened.\"I'M ON MY PERIOD!\" Jun blurted out. Then Skarlet backed away and told her she was just trying to scare her.\"Oh...\" She blushed with a tight-lipped smile.There was an awkward pause. \"It woooooooorked.\"", "1450425954000": "(Time skip to after Jun's training with Lum'Valia)The horse-sized black crow was struggling to flap its wings against the thin air. Meanwhile Jun was becoming light-headed. \"Cold... cold... cold...\" She was wearing a thick fur coat over her armor, but even then her defenses were getting overwhelmed.One advantage she did have was her headpiece, which with its holy properties actually helped her cells continue to metabolize normally even with the reduced oxygen levels. But even so, this was not a pleasant experience. She didn't dare summon flames as she did not want to risk hurting her ride.SQUAWK! The massive demon crow was disgruntled to say the least. Jun tried her best to reassure him. \"It's ok. I'll use Blueberry next time. Consider it a compliment.\" She carefully caressed the bird underneath its neck.Slowly they ascended their way past several rocky outcroppings. \"Ehhh... huh, it does feel kinda warm here.\" Then they would spot the opening to the cavern. The creature threw its massive wingspan open and landed with a thud. Jun hopped off and reached into her bag. \"Ok, most of this is for Fundor but I'll give you a piece.\" It was a hunk of marinated mutton that had been carefully salted and wrapped. It was damn near frozen, but being in the warm cavern actually made it somewhat appetizing. Blackbean took the hunk of meat in its powerful beak and snapped it up. As he was swallowing it, Jun removed her coat, revealing her new black armor.\"Alright, you can go now. Thanks for the ride.\" She patted the bird's head. It squawked in maligned resignation and lightly jabbed the top of her head before disappearing into the shadows. \"OUCH!\" Jun grimaced and ruffled her hair while giving the disappearing demon stink eye. (She had to appreciate the clever bird's humor though. Her so-called helmet was more of a crown, and while very effective against magic, it technically did little against physical attacks from behind). When he had left, she began to drag the meat sack down into the cavern. The temperature rapidly increased, though again her helmet gave her some protection against the elements. It also helped defrost the meat. Finally she made it to the chamber.\"Hey, Fundor! Fundor!\" Her voiced echoed inside the great hall. \"Goddaaaaaaaaamn.\" That's when she noticed the treasures everywhere. She wasn't interested in the gold itself, just very, very impressed. \"It's me! The human from Merrimill! I brought you a gift!\"", "1450571477000": "Jun's eyes grew wide with alarm. She flailed her hands in front of her. \"Uh... D... Doobie helped me make the mutton! He's a friend! And besides you know how disgusting kobolds taste what with all the worms and sticks and stuff they eat. Besides I can't remember the last time he bathed. You'd be better off eating a colony of lamprey eels!\"She really hoped Doobie wouldn't be offended.\"Actually, now that you mention it, you might find Doobie an interesting fellow. He's one of the few kobolds who can use magic, and on top of that he's created a revolutionary new type of construct called a Stand. You wouldn't wanna eat someone who honors his entire species, especially one that practically worships dragons, right?\"", "1450811507000": "Jun was entranced by Fundor's massive red iris. His eyeball alone was comparable to her entire body size. She stared deep within the eyeball, admiring the smooth and glistening surface of the cornea, the clay-like texture of the iris, the black emptiness of the eternal void that was his pupil. She couldn't believe she was thinking this, but the truth is Fundor's giant eyeball was the most beautiful think she had ever beheld, more beautiful than a giant gem stone or Lum'Valia's holy scales.\"Wha...\" Jun shook her head and snapped out of her trance. \"Oh, right. Well, after that giant dragon destroyed Merrimill, I asked Lum'Valia to teach me a way to help protect the people I care about, and so she gave me lessons in light magic. Observe. KUN KUZ BULD!\"There were two blinding flashes of light to Jun's sides. Afterwards came a screeching sound and two massive blades, far bigger than any human could wield, materialized. They were shaped like scimitars and seemed to be made out of a translucent, luminous white stone, like a radioactive quartz if such a thing existed.\"I convinced Lum'Valia that I needed to explore all the different sides of my soul, both my good and... er... not so good sides, so she held off on teaching me holy magic so I could come here. She helped me unlock my potential for light magic, but my natural affinities are darkness and fire. So...\"Jun dismissed her swords. With a smaller screech they cracked and dissipated into small shards which faded away. \"I guess... I dunno. Teach me the opposite of... that.\" She pointed to where her swords had faded. \"I mean, you're the dragon, you're the one with all the ancient wisdom and stuff. What do you think I should learn?\"", "1450984606000": "\"Well that's good, because if you eat my friend I'll... I'll... eat... one... of... you're friends? Oiiiii...\" Jun flushed at her own stupid threat as she walked towards an open space in the lair. As she walked she muttered to herself in a barely audible voice. \"That was a horrible threat. Oh I'd like to see you do better. You know it'd take hundreds of years to eat one of his friends. Who asked you? Does he even have friends? Yah, make fun of the two thousand year old dragon in ear shot...\"Jun still hadn't fully recovered from Lum'Valia's mind split training.She stood in front of the open space and took a deep breath. Her new rig made its classic whirring sound, like a winding up jet engine, as sparks of mana shot up the chains and into her arms and hands. Jun shot her palms outwards. A torrent of bright orange and red flames shot out about 150 feet, swirling and rippling as it traveled and spraying yellow embers all over the floor. Jun thrust her palms a second time and a blast of hot air cut right through the smoke and flames, dissipating them and striking a boulder with a thud. The boulder was unharmed, but glowing slightly red.\"Fire Art: Plasma Blast!\" A bluish sphere of fire and energy gathered itself into her palms before flying outwards towards the boulder. It struck the boulder with a loud crack, punching a hole through it and sending cracks throughout its body. Bits of stone fragments flew everywhere and more stone crumbled off the boulder and rolled to the floor.\"These next two spells need some preparation.\" Jun took several deep breaths. The more breaths she took the more her body gave off a faint orange glow, until finally she was bathed in an orange aura. \"Fire Art: Acetylene Beam!\" She pointed at the ground. There was a loud screeching sound and a golden beam of energy shot out of her finger tip and melted its way into the stone. As she raised her finger upwards to a 90 degree angle, the beam cut its way through the stone, leaving behind a glowing red trench.\"One left.\" Jun took her macuahuitl and sliced the obsidian stone into her her hand. She walked towards the center of the clear space. The blood began to glow with a bright magenta. \"This also counts as a dark spell\". Jun thrust her palms together. Some of the blood droplets sprayed out a bit. \"Fire Art: CORONAL SHOCKWAVE!\"A bubble of strange, crimson flames exploded out from her body. The bubble's final diameter was about 100 feet. It was gone in a flash, leaving behind a fairly large, though shallow, crater of broken rock around her.\"There, that's my strongest attack OH GOD OH GOD!\" Jun started to smack herself in the back of the head, which had evidently caught fire. \"Atatatatata...ta.. Phew.\" The flames quickly went out. Once again Jun's face turned red.", "1451106254000": "Jun nervously followed the giant creature, eyeing his massive tail in case it accidentally took a swing at her. She tried not to think about the fact that Fundor could kill her and Doobie in an instant if he decided to be a jerk, or was just careless... or just sneezed.When they came to the lava pool, Jun immediately felt the lava's heat smack her in the face. She hoped poor Doobie was ok. She looked up at Fundor nervously. \"Wow, I'd sure hate to be thrown into that thing.\"", "1451184314000": "Jun's face turned slightly red and her jaw dropped. She couldn't tell which was hotter, the lava or Fundor's human form.\"Oh right.\" She removed her head piece.Nope, definitely the lava. She could tolerate the heat, but just barely.\"Ok... What do I do?\" she said with a pained expression.", "1451263624000": "\"Er... ok.\" Jun wasn't sure she was comfortable with the idea of being completely defenseless, but she did as she was told.First thing she did was teleport. That alone drained a chunk of her mana. She was enveloped in a bright blue flash of lightning and reappeared right next to where she was before. Then she fired a blast of fire energy at a point on the ground behind her, shattering the rock. \"Vokrii!\" She shouted. A white energy radiated from her body and also encompassed the shards of rock, which fell back into place. She had essentially \"healed\" the rock. Then she teleported again, back where she started.This rotation was as costly a series of spells as she could think of. The plasma blast wasn't too bad, but teleportation and Lum'Valia's healing spell were very costly. In less than a minute her mana was depleted.However, she did have a power source left. She pulled out her macuahuitl. She reopened the cut in her hand. As the blood poored out it became a bright magenta color. She knew she could use this power until she died, but then that would defeat the purpose of her training. So instead she opted for one more spell, so as to deplete her energy to where she wasn't comfortable using it safely anymore. The blood began to float in midair and formed into a violent bright sphere, which then burst into a tiny ball of fireworks. She essentially dismissed her energy bomb.Jun leaned on her knees. \"Ok... I... think that's it... now what?\"", "1451334769000": "\"How can there be anything left? I can try.\" Jun turned towards the center of the training area again. She felt like she needed to think. She was certain she couldn't cast another spell. \"Fire Art: Plasma Blast!\" A tiny spark formed in her palms, but it wasn't very cohesive and soon dissipated. GRR! Jun thrust her palm out. The tiniest flame shot out of her palm. \"ATCH!\" She was so low on mana that her own flames were harming her. It didn't help that it was the same palm that she had cut into. Without even thinking she muttered the phrase \"Vokrii.\"To her surprise, the cut sealed up.Jun looked at it aghast. She was positive she was out of mana... wasn't she?Mana was, in Jun's tribe, like a singing voice, used to reach out to nature and the elements. Jun never really felt separated from the elements before. Why would she want to? Especially after Zaltos' training, the elements were like her friends. That's when she realized that even on a subconscious level, she couldn't bare being separated... in other words, subconsciously she must have still had some mana in reserve.And she was too scared to deplete it completely.But if what Fundor was saying was true, the surrounding energy could be used by her, somehow.Could the natural forces... sing back?Jun took a deep breath. She felt around in her mind, in her heart, seeking out the fear she had of losing her connection with nature, and she focused more and more on letting go.\"Let go. Let go. Let go...\"This took several minutes. It wasn't easy. To her it felt like overcoming a fear of death itself. In a sense this was true. With absolutely no mana, there was nothing stopping Fundor from instant killing her. The best she could hope for was to use blood magic in a suicide attack... Just like Lynx did-Lynx didn't fear death.Bolts of mana began to spark and sizzle from Jun's body as she continued to mutter the phrase \"Let go.\" After a few seconds, the mana faded away and Jun collapsed on her knees and stared on the ground, wide-eyed.Now she really was out of mana.\"I... feel... naked... I'm scared.\"", "1451455419000": "\"You're telling me... if this doesn't work... I die... right here... right now?\"Jun smacked her head against the stone.\"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh yah sure what else is new?\"Jun started to concentrate, feeling the air for mana. But she was having trouble. Her own thoughts were in the way. Wait, if doesn't work, I'm literally going to die. Dead. Finished. You're an idiot.You can do it!Her other selves were arguing in her mind. You should give up now. Not when you've come this far!Jun seethed. She tried to cast a low level spell.Immediately she felt an intense pain in her chest. She stopped and started gasping for breath while clutching her chest, her face scrunched up in agony.If Fundor tried to say anything, she'd raise her hand and scold. \"I'M... NOT... done.\"This was definitely no joke. The sensation was a strange one, one of loneliness and anguish. The elements, they were gone. She couldn't reach out to them, commune with them, sing to them.They were gone.But were they really gone? Fundor said the energy around her could be used. In a sense, the elements had to be able to reach back. After recovering, Jun reached out towards the lava, trying to feel the heat as much as possible, imagining it as a friend, as lending a hand. She tried to cast a spell again.Once again she felt a horrific pain in her chest, like everything in her body just wanted to stop. \"GAHH!\" She screamed audibly and scrunched into a fetal position. There were tears in her eyes.But once again she did not allow Fundor to say anything.Her last attempt would probably kill her.Bleating like an injured sheep, Jun restored herself to at least a kneeling position. I have to do this. I have to do this...I have to do this.I have to do this.Jun squinted at the lava. \"I'm not going to die here-\" Jun was interrupted by a loud cough. She couldn't help herself and lurched forward, spitting out a thin spray of blood. It started to glow, but then Jun squirmed and squealing and scrunched her eyes together until the blood returned to its normal form. Oddly enough the intense heat from the lava was now at the bottom of her list of concerns-\"Wait a second... That could be it. The heat... My body doesn't WANT to feel the heat.\" Jun began to remove her armor, one piece at a time, and set it down next to her head piece. She even went as far as removing her rig. With no mana in her body it was no good to her anyway. Jun was basically now in t-shirt and underwear. A thin cotton cloth separated her and the intense heat of the lava, which she now started to walk closer towards. Her feet felt like they were burning. Her skin was soaked in sweat, which did nothing since even the sweat itself was heating up.\"If I die Fundor... Lum'Valia was a better teacher than you.\"Jun took a deep breath. But something caught her off-guard. Something, a presence, felt like it was trying to enter her lungs.The heat... is your friend, your ally, the element itself is your friend!\"Fire Art...\" Jun said this in between a frantic gasping of breath. Her heart still hurt badly and she felt light-headed. Whatever euphoria she was feeling from her daring attempt wouldn't last. One more failure and she was dead. \"Fire Art...\"More of the presence entered her lungs. It caressed her face, her hands, her entire body. Soon she began to glow with a faint yellow.She opened her eyes. They were glowing.\"PLASMA BLAST!\" She swung around and faced away from the fire. A sphere of blue flames appeared in her hands and fired at the center of the platform, punching a crater in the rock.Jun immediately fell forward on her knees and blacked out, thankfully away from the lava pool.But hey, she wasn't dead.", "1451884270000": "Jun would wake up a few hours later in, well, where ever Fundor left her. \"Ugh, why does all my training leave me feeling hung over?\"Assuming she was still in the cave, she would walking around, exploring it, still without her armor, which would HOPEFULLY be placed in a neat pile somewhere in visual range.She would go back to the lava pool and try to feel for the heat energy... She realized she could when the heat pooled into her hand and formed itself into a little glowing mass, all without exhausting her mana. It was kind of fun.For however long she could do so without being disturbed, she would continue to train and practice using the heat energy from the lava pool.", "1451884521000": "By now Jun had fireballs dancing around her. \"Hey! I did it! I almost died... again... this is what the third time now... but I did it!\"That's when she noticed Doobie's hand. \"Ouch, what happened to your hand?\"", "1451885282000": "\"Ouch, here, let me look at that.\" Jun carefully grasped Doobie's hand. \"Vokrii.\"The injury would heal.\"Hey, I'm working on this thing where I can absorb heat energy. Look!\" Jun reached out at the lava pool. A faint glow pooled from the lava into her hands, forming another fire ball. That fireball danced around her too.\"Is there anyway I can help you practice with your Stand while you help me practice absorbing heat energy? You basically just have to throw fireballs around.\"", "1451889594000": "\"Hmm.\" Jun combines the fireballs together into a big fireball and spins it on her finger.\"If you need help teaching him fire spells, let me know.\" She throws the fireball at a stalagmite and blows it to smithereens. \"I feel really good about my fire spells now.\"", "1452052937000": "\"Yes, that sounds awesome!\" Jun decided to take a break. She sat down on the hot rock, which actually didn't bother her anymore even though she was still basically in her shorts. The heat energy just sort of flowed into her.", "1452055734000": "Jun decided to join in. She didn't know the words, but she could clap in tune while at least vaguely moving her hips around. Then she remembered Calico Schwartz.Her dancing improved.And she started to sparkle.\"Hah, screw it! Kun Kuz Buld!\" A light construct drum and a light golem appeared next to her. Jun, still hopping around to the music, began to beat the drum in tune to the music. Meanwhile the golem joined Starman and started dancing alongside him.Strangely, the golem was a better dancer than Jun herself.(Couldn't find a picture of a dancing golem. Just imagine a golem dancing disco.)", "1452278558000": "Jun dismissed her golem. She grinned back with a smoldering yellow gaze.\"Of course! I think I'm developing a strange addiction to almost dying.\"Sadly she wasn't kidding.", "1452280937000": "\"YOL... YOL... GAHNOS... GAHNOS... LAHSPAAN... LAHSPAAN... VILD... VILD...\"Jun tried to stay awake during the boring training, especially since the cavern's heat was so comfortable to her now.", "1452457251000": "\"Losnaar lahspaan koraavut iidah.\" As she said this, a barely detectable ward would appear around her.\"It's weird. I feel like human magic is all about forcing nature's energy to do what you want it to through concentration and skill. But draconic magic is more about... asking it what you want, I guess? Treating it like it's your friend rather than a weapon?\"", "1452567744000": "(Since we're wrapping up)\"Lahspaan, kuz frin, wahl palaar!\"Unfortuntaly Jun's ward was not as elegant as Fundor's, but it did the job. A shimmering, purplish mass, like a flat tile, appeared next to the humanoid dragon. Below it was a swirling vortex of flames and fire.\"Well, it's practical.\" Jun hopped onto the ward. It stood fast.\"You're amazing! Thank you so much!\" If allowed, Jun would viciously hug the giant's human form... even though she was three feet shorter than him and kinda spikey.\"I'll make sure to bring you some mutton next chance I get! We're friends now, right?\"She'd motion towards Doobie. \"We should go. Remember not to steal anything!\"One last thing. Jun intended for their return trip to be a lot more comfortable, so she cried out, \"Kuhn kuz buld!\" A floating half bubble, an upside down dome that she and Doobie could comfortably sit in, would appear. But Jun wasn't done. She raised her hands outward towards the cavern's ceiling. Heat energy would gather from her surroundings and around the bubble in soft little magic embers.\"Should be much warmer this time.\"<exit>", "1489694747000": "\"No, Blackbean, stop, no it's not for you. You ate already what is wrong with you?\"Jun was floating down the rocky slope from the cave entrance. Her vehicle of choice was a hovering disk of white light. She had gotten much stronger since the last time she was in this cavern and now found the travel a good deal more convenient. She had a large bag of mutton by her side, and Blackbean was hopping along beside her, constantly pecking at it.\"No, dammit fine you can have a piece.\" Jun pulled out a small mutton chop and carefully placed it in Blackbean's beak. \"I can't stay mad at you you overgrown feather mop.\"A minute later they had entered the open cavern where Jun had mastered the absorption of heat energy. Hence the environment was much more comfortable.\"Fundor! Hey, Fundor! Uh, coi ui ulph ve, Jun. Si dronilnra wux vi whais hefoc annyo tairais. Coi ui ulph vi, umm, offering.

But if I remember the reports Jarkoopi has only gotten stronger since you last met him. Do what you must I guess.\" Jun folded her arms and tapped her plate armor with her finger. \"All we really care about is the gem, although certain people wouldn't mind some of the items in that lair. You could expect a mutton delivery every week for several years if you'd let them have some of what's in there, especially human prisoners if there are any.\"CAWK! Blackbean was either agreeing with Jun or yelling defiantly at Fundor's massive size.", "1461814095000": "There was a giant crow on-board.Jun had already started going over various spells they would use. She explained to Viddik that she believed that the creature might be sentient, and so they should try to capture the creature alive so they could negotiate. She already had Resonance in her hand, ready and willing to go.They would of course kill it if it turned out to not be the case.As for the crow, Jun had dismissed the shrinking spell on Blackbean. Now the creature was in its true form. It was larger than a horse and strong enough to carry a full-grown man.", "1461821324000": "Jun was in the middle of making her final preparations to fly down there. She was already wearing her dragon scale armor and helm. She was quickly spraying herself and Blackbean with a perfume which would make them smell like sea air. That's when someone would point out that the creature was attempting to board the ship.She grabbed a bag of supplies and sat on top of Blackbean. Carefully noting the direction of the wind and where the creature's line of site would be, she took off. She stayed in the cloud cover as long as she could while Resonance began to draw energy from from her body. She knew just the spell she wanted to use to capture the creature. Her hands and the sword began to glow subtly. (Charge 1)Blackbean would carefully glide down towards the ship from the other side. The creature would (hopefully) not sense her approach, too distracted looking for cannon ports and cargo. Even if she did, Blackbean would just look like a regular crow from below, the creature's size not immediately apparent, and the rider hidden by the crow's profile. The light from her hands and Resonance would also be obstructed by the low reflectivity of the black bird's wings.Jun double checked to make sure she had the white flag was in her supplies, and that the creature would recognize they she just wanted to talk (assuming her plan worked).", "1461824697000": "Without incident, Jun had landed on board the ship. She was ready to cast her spell right away, but seeing as there was no horrible sea monster on the deck, she surmised the creature must have found an opening and was now below deck. Resonance continued to draw mana from Jun's body. It was now glowing fairly brightly. (Charge 2)Holding up her little buckler, she sheathed her sword and pulled out the white flag. (Resonance still held her mana, ready to use almost instantly). She whispered to the skeleton crew, \"It's below deckkk. Shhhh.\" She then entered the inner bowls of the ship while the crew made its preparations. Blackbean stayed on board.Creeping along inside the dark passageway, she would make it to the entrance of the cargo hold, probably at about the same time the creature made it there. She could cast her spell right away, but the very first thing she would say in a grave, low voice.\"Do not move or we both die.\"", "1461828993000": "Jun smirked. \"I like you already...\" She shook her head however and became serious again. \"Listen, if we fight, I don't know which of us is gonna win. But I'd rather not cross that bridge yet...\" With her white flag hand Jun gradually pointed up towards the deck. \"There's an airship hiding in the clouds above, with a very mean and scary looking commander ready to fire a very powerful lightning spell on us. And the cargo hold is full of oil. I don't know if you've ever seen what happens when oil is exposed to extreme heat... but it's not good. If I don't give him a sign that I'm ok in the next minute or so, this whole ship will be destroyed. So what I want us to do, is very carefully, come above deck, together. I just want to talk. I'll even let you wrap your tail around my neck.\"Jun stared straight in the eye of the creature and waited.", "1461830914000": "As Jun and the naga climbed up the stairs towards the top hatch, her face remained absolutely stern. This was good, because she really wanted to sigh in relief. What she had told was a bold faced lie. Her real plan had been to capture her in a light construct bubble if she didn't comply, an option which was still available to her.However, her intent to negotiate was serious. Jun genuinely did not want to fight the creature or kill it, especially knowing that it was an intelligent being.When they made it to the deck, Jun raised up her hands towards the skeleton crew of mages. \"It's ok, we're fine, everyone stay calm! No one is going to hurt anyone.\" The naga would see that she was dealing with a relatively small human female, with olive brown eyes and slightly tanned skin. The girl was actually well armed, not only with armor but with a brightly glowing sword and a strange rig of some kind, a scepter strapped to her lower back with two chains leading up to bracers on her arms. It would now become apparent that she was a powerful mage, and that her melee armaments were only secondary defenses.She turned to face the naga. \"My name is Jun. I'm acting as an ambassador for one of the parties that's been shipping across the sea. Who are you?\"", "1461833528000": "Oh god she's really scary and she smells like fish.Outside she was stoic as stone, but inside her head she was whimpering.Ok, I got this. I can do this.\"Okay!\" She said this with a voice an octave higher than normal. \"Well-\" She cleared her throat. \"Well then... Your majesty, Kryqim, it's, umm, it's an honor to meet you. I'd bow but... well...\" She pointed to the fleshy coil around her neck. \"I'm sorry... about your husband. One of my closest friends lost her entire... family recently... I lost my grandmother last year... twice... that's a long story... You probably don't care... ANYWAYS...\"Jun realizes she is still holding the white flag. Unsure what to do with it she starts trying to awkwardly twirl it in her hand.\"So... I'd like to get straight to the point. I want to humbly request that our ships be granted safe passage through your oceans, and how we can remedy any inconvenience they may be causing you...\"", "1461879748000": "In the split second that the queen decided to throw Jun, Resonance would sense the danger. The sword itself would fly into her hand as she made the slicing motion, the impossibly sharp magical blade would cut right through the queen's flesh.If her attack was successful, without losing her composure, Jun would roll along the deck and get back up. \"Bel Nal Kuhn!\" The sword would release the magic it had been gathering this whole time. Almost immediately a large bubble of light energy as hard as stone would appear around the queen, trapping her. Immediately afterwards Jun would run up to the bubble and start applying magical scroll seals to strengthen it. The seals would cause glowing blue runic lines to spread out like spider webs around the bubble as the Queen was no doubt thrashing inside.The bubble was translucent. Though it had a pale whiteness to it, the Queen would be able to hear and see everything outside.\"Ok! Fine, we admit it. This was a trap. The truth is we could have killed you the moment you set foot on the ship. But we didn't. We really do want to talk and try to make things right... Although I guess I should heal your tail first.\"", "1461883484000": "Jun's eyes widened as the Queen delivered a colossal impact against the shield. Still, it would take more than that to shatter it, especially now that it was reinforced.She sighed. \"Viddik, the queen has a point. She and her people do have a claim to these waters. And if the ships of Isra and Gauldin are harming them somehow, then don't they have a responsibility to address those concerns?\"She turned to the queen. \"Tell us, how are the ships causing harm to the ocean, and what methods would you prescribe to prevent the damage? Although, before you say anything, I should point out that the presence of the ships is non-negotiable. I have no say in that, I'm just the dog.\" She smirked.At the same time, Jun's giant pet crow Blackbean would hop up to the bubble, staring at it curiously with one eye.\u00a0", "1461893724000": "Jun thought for a moment. What would Lum'Valia do?Jun walked back towards the shield, and slowly began to peel away the scrolls enhancing the shield. \"We're not going to let you leave until this is settled. But if we can't do this peacefully, the least I can do is give you a fighting chance. I don't know what's going to happen if we fight. Maybe you'll kill us all. Maybe we'll kill you in an instant. Maybe we'll all be destroyed. But all I can say for certain is that we're all very much alive and in one piece right here and right now.\"With the scrolls removed, the shield became noticeably weaker. Jun waved her hand.The shield would collapse, and the queen would presumably plop to the ground.\"I've never killed someone I've respected, and quite frankly I don't wanna die either. Vokrii.\" Jun waved her hand again. With a bright flash of light, the queen's tail would be healed.She sheathed her sword. \"Now... what can our ships do to prevent from harming your kingdom, aside from not being here at all?\"", "1461904672000": "Jun nods and begins to look around at the ocean. Now she was beginning to see the problem. All forms of human activity in the waters had consequences, however unintentional they were. Trash, oil fires, hunting, they were all what this creature perceived to be infringements on her territory.Jun pulled out a scroll and an pencil she had on her. \"Ok... see now we're getting somewhere. So... the Gauldish and Isranian ships would have to avoid disposing waste into the waters. Fishing of larger sea creatures for sport would have to be limited or even forbidden. Oil and chemicals must be kept out of the water at all costs. Basically we have to learn to treat the sea itself like it is its own kingdom. So, your majesty, let's say these are your opening terms. I believe I could convinced my employer to agree to them rather easily. But I'm not so sure about Gauldin.\"She turned to Viddik. \"What do you think? You know your government better than anyone.\"", "1461994369000": "\"Excellent! We should draft a treaty together to this effect... Oh... Maybe something more substantial that plain scroll paper.\" Jun pulled out some more sheets of paper and began enchanting them with more permanent letters. She wrote the treaty herself, occasionally muttering to herself. The treaty went something like this:On this day, it is agreed that all naval activity involving Isra and Gauldin across the sea lanes between their kingdoms, extended as far out beyond the following borders (a crude map was included in the treaty with the help of Viddik and the Queen) shall show due respect for the oceans that are being traverse, as they are in effect a separate kingdom with rights and responsibilities to its inhabitants. Specifically, the following rules shall be adhered to:All ships will, to the best of their ability and with intent towards perfect compliance, avoid disposing of chemicals, chemical waste, oil, poison, alchemical compounds, or any other materials which can be construed as hazardous towards sea life, with the exception of human biological waste.The practice of sport fishing shall be outlawed.Should all naval activity be in compliance with these rules, than it is agreed that naval activity from Isra and Gauldin shall be permitted access to trade routes as outlined on the map, without fear of repercussions from the sentient denizens of the ocean or Queen Kryqim.X______________________ X_____________________ X Jun of the Celadine, Ambassador of Isra\"What do you guys think?\"", "1462115840000": "\"I would assume so, yah.\" She winces at first at how the queen signed the contract, somewhat guilty for not simply handing her a writing utensil sooner. \"In fact, we wouldn't necessarily have to discuss this immediately, but I was actually thinking we could make some sort of alliance, like a trade agreement that benefits both of us or something. I mean, what we have here is essentially a non-aggression pact. But we could probably do better.\"Meanwhile there was something else happening, in Jun's mind.\"Empress Naoki, are you getting all this? What do you think?\"", "1462311240000": "Jun was nervous when the Queen raised her staff. She wouldn't betray them now would she? No, of course not. Jun walked over to the edge of the dock and watched the dolphins leap out of the water. WOW! Jun hadn't seen dolphins in a long time, not since that fateful vacation trip with Calico... Her face blushed slightly as the dolphins delivered their gives into the queen's hands. She waved them off.\"Thank you!\" She said as she received the pendant. \"Me and my 'lord' will have to discuss future possibilities about what we can offer your people, but for now I think our alliance is set. It was an honor meeting you your majesty.\" She bowed.Jun's giant crow cawed and fluttered its wings. \"Blackbean says hi.\"***Assuming the queen had completed her task and was due to depart, Jun would turn to Viddik with a stretch and a yawn. \"Well that was entertaining. I'm kinda hungry. Empress Naoki has\u00a0already been informed of the situation via telepathic link, so there isn't much for me to do other than deliver this pendant to her. Wanna get some dinner in Gauldin? I'm... craving sea food for some reason.\"", "1582594970000": "It was as if she had made a subconscious effort to stay humble. Her gambeson, on the surface, was old and cozy. Her hair was clean, but frayed and matted. Her face was a bit gaunt, but her eyes were bright and healthy. Blackbean was armorless and just an ordinary-looking familiar on her shoulder.There was the matter of the bandages on her left arm, but they were mostly concealed down to the wrists by her coat sleeve.At first she was nervous, but as soon as she actually saw her, all that evaporated. Without hesitation, she marched right into the common room, sat down at Camilla's table, and looked her straight in the eye. She leaned in slightly and said, \"It's literally been years since I've had a scotch egg.\" And she cracked the most joyful shit-eating grin her face could muster.It was good to see Camilla again.", "1582598621000": "Jun took an egg, paused, and then held it up in front of Blackbean instead of her own mouth. The crow, unconcerned by whether or not it should be allowed in the establishment, plucked it and swallowed it whole. Getting that bit of comedic timing out of her system, she then took an egg for herself.She sighed and swallowed as Camilla asked how she had been. Her head lowered onto the table. She held it there, chin hovering over the surface, eyes gazing at Camilla's hair. Her pressed lips and deadpan stare just about answered her question. But just to be safe-\"... About the same as you.\" She smirked and reached into one of her hidden coat pockets and pulled out what looked like a dying rose. It was a similar variety to the one that Camilla was tending to when they met all those years ago. She remembered she had been able to restore it with a forceful display of earth magic. But Camilla had done something else. She spoke to it.Jun carefully laid it out on the table. \"Psst.\" She said.The rose's brown thorns turned sharp, its stem verdant, and its pallid, sickly petals flushed with red.She looked at Camilla and said nothing. But something about the glint in her eyes spelled it out clear as day.Look, Mrs. Blake! I got it! I actually got it!", "1582658210000": "Jun reached out her hands in return. The bandages on her left arm poked out a bit under her sleeve.There was a parallel in their thoughts. Remembering the fall of Medan also brought back memories of the fall of Aedan, the Imperium, and very nearly her very own homeland. There was much Jun suddenly wanted to say as she held Camilla's hands. I'm sorry. You have no fucking clue how right you are. I understand how you feel now.\"Yah, yah it has.\"The subject of Camilla's hair made Jun wince a little bit. She was still socially awkward, but with a bit of maturity came the sense to at least be embarrassed about it. She wasn't one to mind her gaze much. So now she had to ask. \"Trust me, your face has weathered time a lot better than my skin. Although in my culture, some such signs are badges of honor. Scars, stretch marks... white hair.\" She grinned. \"Although, why do I get the feeling there's more to the story than you growing in wisdom?\"", "1582681042000": "Jun\u2019s jaw dropped at hearing that Camilla had almost lost Ambre. She struggled to remember the last conversation they had in Captain Blake\u2019s house as Camilla said her piece. It was a lovely sentiment for them both. Yes, the knowledge that they were survivors, that they shared that kindred experience despite being very different from each other. Her hands gripped tighter. Her expression further warmed at Camilla\u2019s appreciation of the rose.At the last bit, she sighed. \"I'm glad you think so. The truth is, you were the first in a long line of friends that helped give me direction and define who I was. If it wasn't for you I might gone down a much uglier path, pursued magicks you might have found offensive. If you're half as influential on your children, they'll all turn out strong in spirit. Long live the Verri bloodline-\"\u00a0She paused. She shook her head. \"That's a sensitive topic I am... such a bad friend.\" She chuckled at her own stupidity. \"You should raise Ambre to be a noble, not a warrior. We are abysmal at social graces. Speaking of which, I remember that she was born premature, shortly after the Goraians had been defeated. Were your hair roots permanently singed by stress from the experience, or did something else happen?\"She waited in bated breath for Camilla\u2019s reply and tried not to think about how she almost certainly could have phrased that more tactfully.", "1582695822000": "Jun sighed and finally decided to pull back the sleeve of her left arm, revealing the bandaged limb in full. As she did this she spoke. \"The problem with being a hero and protecting the ones you love, is time management. Splitting your time wisely between the people you love and the training and discipline necessary to protect them. I'll never know if my training was absolutely necessary in helping to besiege Goraia, or if I should have stayed in Medan when Zephidel took over, or if being there at the time would have gotten me killed. Likewise, did my loyalty to Isra prevent me from being in the Southern Plains when the Wyld attacked, or did it save my life and allow me to be more effective?\"She laid her arm down against the table. She wiggled the fingers to demonstrate that it was functional, although something was clearly wrong with it, or else it would not be bandaged. \"This was because of a wrong choice. I pushed myself too far, and so I... had to make some changes to my fighting style as a result.\" She smirked sheepishly. \"I've been in seclusion for a while. Most of my human contact has just been the boyfriend. I just... don't feel like being much alone anymore.\"She leaned back, hiding her bandaged arm under the sleeve again. \"I think I'm almost back to full strength physically. But emotionally, I'm feeling kind of lost. Long story short, I don't really know what to do.\"*Caw!*Jun had almost forgotten about Blackbean. \"He's recommending I start with a stiff drink. Little fuzzy enabling bastard.\"Blackbean preened smuggly.", "1582749510000": "Jun happily gripped in return. It didn't hurt, thankfully. She turned and grinned at Blackbean.\"He had a really bad experience with a cookie and it's made him far more uppity. But that's a story for another time.\"She turned back to Camilla while waiting for their refreshments. \"I've never been one to surrender. And neither have you. That drive we have, it makes us who we are. We push through life like a paddle through white water. And I guess sometimes... we hit a rock.\" She backed up slightly, because she had thought mistakenly for a second she was mostly talking about herself. But she shook this feeling off. \"I think you did the right thing. It was worth it to try. If the gem was part of a cycle, then someone would have taken it anyways. Too much power is dangerous.\"She seemed to remember something. She pulled her hand away and started rummaging through a hidden pocket in her clothing. Blackbean jumped forward onto the table and helped himself to another scotched egg.She pulled out a small scroll which was sealed with a golden wax. \"You inspired me to design a new spell.\" She grinned proudly. Along the length of the scroll, there was some black, ornate, cursive lettering. It read: \"The Doobie Du Shoobie Special.\" Jun would seem to realize this made no sense at the same time that Camilla would. \"Oh, wait that's the wrong one. Shit did I leave it at home?\" She quickly put the scroll away and started searching through more pockets.\"Uh so, what about you? What do you plan on doing?\" She asked as she searched. \"I remember something about a school?\"", "1582775226000": "Jun continued to finger her pockets for the scroll in question, but she still listened to Camilla attentively.\"No no no not at all! I think it's great you're such an excellent mother. Oh dear.\"She pulled out scrolls one by one and placed them on the table. They jostled back and forth on the table and at one point Blackbean had to intervene with his beak to prevent one from rolling off.Camilla might find some of the names amusing:Van'ei's Ballroom GownFundor: Belcher of SheepLum'Valia's WigRara Sis Boom BaThe Mighty Mr. CarrotAs the collection grew and Jun had started checking pockets in her pants, she said \"Uh, SO, uh, tell me, uh, how are the kiddos doing? What has motherhood been like?\"Jarkoopi's TalonImperiumShe even placed the Doobie du Shoobie Special onto the table again for good measure.Blackbean seemed to exhibit a great deal of concern for these scrolls, arranging them so that they would not fall or be lost. There was something gentle in its efforts, the way that it avoided pecking at the wax seals, nudging them, keeping them away from the scotch eggs and drink. The truth is, a great deal of thought had gone into the creation of each one, which represented an important memory in Jun's life. In a way, spell creation had developed into an art form, a means of self-expression, grounding Jun's sense of self and reminding her of her adventurer's spirit. They helped Jun cope through her recent dark period, and Blackbean had been there for the creation of each one.", "1582867401000": "\"That's a good one by the way.\" She pointed at Fundor: Belcher of Sheep.She seemed quite relieved when her hand shot to her pant leg. Ah yes, one more hidden compartment in her gambeson. She struggled to pull the scroll out without damaging it, her fingers twisting and pulling, trying to negotiate the fabric away from the thin paper edges. Goddamn stupid-\"Uh,\" She winced, \"in so far as Vaelar was able to kick me out of my home. But thankfully my parents came to visit me often enough, especially after the accident. Oh, I did go to visit my cousin Vera. The one I used as bait to try to catch a bear by pouring honey on her head? Good times.\"The was a slight BANG as Jun's wrist hit the underside of the table, the potential energy of the trapped scroll converted into yet another embarrassment. No food was spilled, but Blackbean's pyramid of scrolls threatened to collapse and send parchment all over the floor. Luckily Jun and Blackbean both had pretty good reflexes; one shot her hand towards one end of the doomed structure, while the other hopped in front of the opposite end. The scrolls spread out like piano keys, but none of them hit the ground.Jun snapped herself out of her dead-pan stare and smiled at Camilla. \"Found it!\"She handed her the scroll. This one read Ladies in Waiting.", "1582930723000": "There were many magic schools in the world, and just as many magical languages. Those close to nature and attuned to the elements had a certain style to their symbols Camilla would most likely recognize.However, Jun's earlier work, which perhaps Camilla had seen in the past, was based heavily on brute force. Her spells, as intricate as they were, read like a mathematical proof; magic would come here, power would exit there. It was as simple and effective as algebra, and no doubt her work was potent.But something had changed. The language was the same, but now there were intonations and connotations. It was hard for ordinary folk to understand, but there was feeling to her spell, an invitation to manifest instead of a demand. In overcoming her injury, Jun had explored her relationship with magic further, allowing her to create more creative and unique spells... yes, even including the Doobie Du Shoobie Special.(The effect of \"Ladies in Waiting\")SPOILER: Click to showWhen Camilla and Jun first met, Jun had forcibly resurrected a flower by infusing it with earth magic. However, the symbols invoked here encouraged, A: the propagation of life, B: the infusion of various elements to promote growth gently but rapidly, C: the desire to protect life and not cause harm, D: the assertion of will and mind over hatred and physical violence. These principles enticed the magic to enter into little rose seeds, create the flowers, and then spread their influence throughout a wide area of effect. The end result was dozens of floating blooms arresting the violence of an area, sedating the will of the aggressors and forcibly restraining them with psionic energy. The spell had numerous applications, but it was especially useful for stopping large groups of attackers that one did not wish to kill. The spell was also, subjectively, very beautiful, as one would see if it was ever unleashed. Jun took it back and stared at her collection. Her face turned red and she blushed. \"I'm insane. I hate myself sometimes.\" But truly she felt joy sharing her work with someone who could actually appreciate it. And now she was beginning to understand the delicate power of Camilla's magic as well.She took another scotch egg and chewed through half of it. \"I really need the recipe for these.\"", "1582947855000": "\"That means a lot, Camilla. Thank you.\" She said softly.Reassured, Jun decided it was time to relax. She finally took a swig of drink and leaned back. It was the first genuinely contented sigh she'd had in a while.She missed Camilla. She missed being around friends. She was happy to be around people who didn't judge her for her performance. Well, technically Vaelar didn't judge her for her performance... at least, not in terms of magic.\"The very first time I had a scotch egg... was in Medan. Of all the things that surprised me about the outside world, I think that's what surprised me the most. All the different kinds of food.\"*CAW!*Jun gave Blackbean a queer look and then held her mug to her. The crow reached in and dipped its beak into the drink. Jun gave Camilla a shifty-eyed look. This probably wasn't very sanitary.", "1583031172000": "Jun, perhaps unwisely, took a swig of her cup after pulling it away from Blackbean, who seemed to be sitting and waiting for what effect alcohol would have on its system.Jun craned her neck and rolled her head as she leaned back against her chain again. She stared into her cup, only now making sure there wasn't crow spittle floating in it.... There wasn't.\"I'm not sure. To be honest, it sounds like a nice change of pace. Gods there are so many places in the world that need protecting. I wish I could be in many places at once... Then again Isra is more fortified now than ever before, and really there haven't been any world-ending threats in a while. Maybe I should take you up on that.\"She nodded to herself as the idea grew on her.\"I should take a few of these back for Vaelar. Lately he's been cooking a lot for me and really I ought to return the favor. I just haven't been able to treat him as well as I'd like to.\" She sighed. \"I've been a bad girlfriend lately.\"", "1583118279000": "\"... I mean, of all the ingredients a potion can have, spittle of demon crow isn't the grossest thing out there.\" She took another drink.She nodded with understanding when Camilla explained she'd withdrawn claims to the throne. \"While I have no doubt you have the requisite wisdom of a queen, it's paradoxically that wisdom that keeps you from seeking the throne.\" *Hiccup.*Blackbean, meanwhile, was flattening itself against the surface of the table, its wings spread out slightly, its legs slipping and then collapsing under its body. From this odd position, it started preening itself.*Hiccup*Jun, her cheeks somewhat rosy, raised her finger towards Camilla, bobbing it up and down poignantly. \"Y-you know what you should do. You should teach me how to dance. I haven't- I haven't danced in a long time. I'll bet if I tried slow dancing with Vaelar he would appreciate it greatly. He's such a shentleman. Oh you'd love him. Bit of a questionable past though. He also has a mighty mount, doesn't he Blackbean?\"Blackbean turned towards the nearest serving wench and let out an obnoxious caw.\"You heard the man!\" Jun said while raising her glass towards the wench. *Hiccup.*", "1583271766000": "Jun seemed to take offense at the notion that Camilla would step on her toes. For a brief moment, she gave the former royalty a lobotomized glare, as if half her brain was indignant and the other half was on vacation.\"That,\" she waggled an accusatory finger, \"is absurd. You are royalty, the unadulterated descendent of an ancient bloodline, an opuleshent shtar of grace and nobility, the likes of wish stood imperially against the ineffable entropy-creating ever-expanding cloud of chaos and contempt by the bloated bourgeoishie, antithetical ethical aushterity of the arishtocracy, and unrelenting unresht of the untamed underclashes. Your toes could do no more harm than a feline's shushioned paws on rodent prey. You'd apologishise with apoplectic guilt towards your very immortal shoul, bow with ebullient exuberance and command that the *hiccup* finest linens of the farthest reashes of the world be used to embalm my poor appendages. You'd, you'd...\"Jun blinked.\"Camilla I- you should know I don't handle alcohol well.\"Blackbean looked up at Jun, then seemed to nod towards Camilla in agreement.\"Oooh we should take dance classes together that'd be so cute.\"", "1583295047000": "Jun giggled and her face fell in her hands. \"This is so embarrassing. I had like one cup!\"If Camilla remembered their time together, Jun was notoriously bad at handling alcohol. Normally she was fully aware of this weakness of hers, but this time she seemed to have completely forgotten herself. Perhaps she thought everything she had been through had translated into a scrappy, neck bearded, battle-hardened liver. Unfortunately, she was as dainty as ever in this one regard.\"Anyways, I've contemplated what makes a good leader.\" She grimaced as she tried to focus her thoughts. \"It seems paradoxical... I like that word... anyways, that people who seek the throne are often... well, they're driven, ambitious, often selfish, but, but what about people who are gentle-hearted and actually care? There's, there's a complex mix of attributes that make one a good leader. And... and it seems like... Does this make sense? Sometimes I feel the best leaders are the ones who wouldn't seek the throne, and yet... I'm not sure that's true either. Ambition is positive energy, light energy, the power to effect change... I think the Katashimans call it chi. That power one projects that drives one into that position is an important part of leadership. It's... it's a paradox that I believe makes very good leaders quite rare.\"", "1583363593000": "\"Yesh your mashesty.\"Jun reached for the cup of water, but then Blackbean went for it. She pulled the drink away and scolded sharply, \"No, mine first.\"She gulped exactly 9/10ths of the water cup in 7 seconds. Then she placed it back down for Blackbean to take the rest.\"Your duty is to your family. You should be allowed to have a family. I think you would have made a great queen because you have chosen not to be. You are not too meek and assertive for the throne. And you know what you want. The paradox is that indecision and temptation for power would have made you a poorer queen. You're one of the better paradoxes. I like you.\" *Hiccup*Jun started to go into the stew. \"See I'd make a terrible queen. I'm far too emotional for it. My father's hinted that he wants me to run for clan elder someday. But that's be a terrible decision. I'd do an excellent job for a month and then burn myself out and fall ill. A leader should be stoic and dignified, and know restraint. I'd die for my people in a heartbeat. Ironically that's kind of the problem.\"Blackbean's beak made little click clack noises against the water cup in the background.", "1583454999000": "\"S-s-s-see that could be a problem because if some dashing young ambassador from a far off land tries to offer me wine as a gift I'll have to decline! And what if I needed to lead a band of rugged roguish mercenaries into battle? If they found out I can't handle a pint of mead I'll be a laughing stock! Queen Jun, feller of monsters, felled by a shot of whiskey! And the fact that I talk too much is even worse. A state secret for every mug of ale, they'll say oh god I'm talking too much right now aren't I?\"The hairs on the back of her head rose. She sensed not one, but two ominous presences enter the tavern. Her head slid towards the side and locked into place a few degrees shy of Felix's general direction, but she was too lazy to crane her head all the way to make actual eye contact, so Felix might not notice that his dark nature had been detected. Truthfully this probably worked out in their favor. She turned back to Camilla and whispered. \"There's someone dark and spooky here.\"Then she focused on the second presence. It wasn't vile, but rather arrogant, haughty, and considerably powerful. It made her crack a devilish sneer. She said to Camilla, somewhat more audibly, \"There's someone else obnoxious here.\"\"Wux deevdru di vi riika, how the hell have you been?\" She swung her hand over to Jarkoopi in a dramatic gesture. This could be interpreted as either a request for a hardy handshake, or a hug.It should be noted that at this time there were still many scrolls laid out across the table with spells named after her past allies, including \"Jarkoopi's Talon.\"", "1583535290000": "Jun's head drops to rest on her arm on the table. Her face is still a bit red from being tipsy. She raises her bandaged arm towards Jarkoopi, showing off the wraps just poking out above her slipping sleeve. \"I've been better, kinda getting through a thing. But I'll be alright.\" Her face is relaxed and playful, but the arm on the table nonchalantly reaches towards the \"Ladies in Waiting\" scroll, which would be very useful if these two were to suddenly come to blows in the tavern.She looks over her collection after Jarkoopi poses his second question. Her mind flashes back to when she and Daedalus razed two thousand acres of land with lasers, disease, and flaming ghost animals. \"Yah, you could say that.\"Jun, for her part, was radiating surprisingly little magical energy. Her bandaged arm would seem almost dead in that regard. Her gambeson was\u00a0writhing with a faint presence, and the scrolls on the table were unabashedly enchanted. But Jun's body itself was eerily quiet. But there was something else. A movement, inferior to a light breeze, barely perceptible even to magically inclined beings, circled around Jun, watching her. This presence filled the entire tavern and even extended beyond it into the forests, as if Jun was the eye of a subtle, whispering storm.\u00a0", "1583723279000": "Jun lurched over to face Camilla as she tore out of the room. \"Camilla!?\"She got up, her chair nearly falling over (she was still clumsy from drink after all). She peered through the arch of the doorway, watching as Camilla sought solace near her beloved forest.\"Camilla...\"She sensed it, a connection with the forest uncommon among average spellcasters. She understood it to an extent because she had experienced something similar during her training. But there was something different. Jun had a universal connection with the magic in the air and most life forms around her. But the Usque was Camilla's place, Camilla's history. Jun was a friend of the forest, but Camilla was its\u00a0family. So after hesitating a few seconds, Jun decided the best thing to do was relax and let the former princess' bond with the forests restore her spirit.\"... You know,\" Jun's headed slowly rotated back towards Felix, and her voice was cold and deliberate. \"I may not be quite at full strength yet, but that doesn't mean I'll take kindly to being threatened.\" There was an ominous little crack as Jun's fingernail broke the wax seal of the scroll in her hand. There was also a faint build up magical energy coming from her throat.The air grew still. A lot of air grew still. The whole tavern's air grew still.", "1584946127000": "Jun's stern countenance seemed to melt into red-faced weariness. \"S-s-see see see this is why she's the mature one in our friendship.\" It was as if she had taken the order not to fight as an imperial edict, but without the electric sizzle of being scolded by a parent. And with the threat of combat ceased (at least in Jun's mind), the air throughout the tavern would flow easily once again, and Jun's body would remember that it was three sheets to the wind in monsoon season aboard a dingy.However, there was one individual whose guard had not relaxed. Throughout the entire encounter, Blackbean had been standing stoic as a sentinel right up at Felix. He barked a single loud crow bark up at the bewitched interloper, letting Felix know that he would not be unopposed should he decide to counter common sense and strike at herself or Jarkoopi.Jun meanwhile, started to heave.Something green came spilling out of her mouth.It was not what was expected. Instead, they were vines. Rapidly propagating plant material spilled out onto the table and started to grasp and entwine around the myriad of scrolls that had been laid there. They'd continue to spread out until they encompassed each scroll while forming a mat to which to affix them to. The vines expressed an odd sort of sentience in avoiding jostling any food or drink, and in fact leaving the table cleaner than it was before and smelling of fresh mint.Jun wearily shook her head and reached to pick up an end of the mat which conveniently formed a handle for herself. \"I was too lazy to just put them all away.\"There was still a scroll in her opposite hand, the one with the cracked seal.", "1504469923000": "Jun reached up and gave Alden a supportive shoulder pinch. She couldn't pretend to understand what he was feeling, but it couldn't be easy.Still, this was a mission, and a certain amount of professionalism needed to be had. \"There must have been some activity since you've been gone. If he's or one of his 'students' is still here, we should be cautious on our approach. If you want me and Blackbean can set some magical traps around the forest in case he tries to escape.\"She reached into her pack (which was lighter than when they left) and pulled out a small sack with what sounded like beans juggling inside. Alden's magical sensing eyes would feel a fair amount of energy coming from them.", "1504486908000": "\"Will do.\" Jun pulled out a single seed and bent down to plant it in the ground, just in front of the rotting door.  As she did so she silently muttered some arcane phrases in an unknown language. Eventually the seed would sprout into a small, inconspicuous flower, and a thin veil of magic, only detectable to Alden's vision, would start to propagate outwards and encompass the structure and some of the surrounding forest.Jun would now be able to sense human-sized life forms or larger and major concentrations of magic within the field.", "1504503383000": "\"Something's definitely active down there. My ward can't seem to penetrate below the stairway. I can only say for certain that we aren't surrounded.\"At Alden's warning, Jun drew her blue sword. Its light illuminated the decrepit room briefly before subsiding. She carefully waved it around her body, which after a second was drenched in silent, sparkling light which again lit up the area.When the light faded Jun was covered in green heavy cloth armor that left everything to the imagination. On top of that were solid bits, including a brigandine, tassets, and pauldrons of a darker scale-like material. Her head was protected in a visorless war helmet, made of sun metal and with a silvery trim. She also had, in her left hand, a sun metal buckler with a large blue gem inset in the middle.She might have looked intimidating if she wasn't the shortest one in the bunch, but she thought Alden might appreciate the fact that in the year she had been gone, she had upgraded her armor from black, feminine, and form-fitting to something a bit more practical.\"Achoo!\"Jun sneezed. \"Ugh, I thought I got rid of all the pollen...\" She whispered.", "1504565973000": "Jun had no trouble obeying the command to jump down two steps. She wasn't enchanted for stealth, but she did use the handrail and keep her feet wide apart so that the kinetic energy transfer between her boots and the floor was minimal. She made a very faint thud.When they got to the pillars, Jun recalled what Alden had said about anti-magic. So the first thing she did was attempt to feel out her surroundings for ambient magical energies. Anti-magic would feel like a cold, dead spot to her senses.Assuming she did not sense anything of that nature, she would, unfortunately, raise Resonance in the air, where it would start to emit a faint blue glow. After all, she had never seen a light-triggered trap before...", "1504711716000": "\"What the-\"It was Alden's attempt to intercept the arrows that told her something was wrong a fraction of a second before the arrows hit. But a few arrows managed to impact her brigandine and tassets even as she made the motion to raise her buckler and crouch down. The buckler helped protect her neck. Her helmet helped protect her head, and her pauldrons and tassets protected her arms and legs. These arrows would shatter harmlessly and shower the floor with splinters and arrow heads. Jun grunted angrily as she felt some of the arrows impact the cloth parts of her armor. While it was designed to prevent full penetration from the arrows, they would still cause a sharp pain and leave a small cut and painful bruising.About a second later however, the gem on her buckler emitted a bright blue glow, and tendrils of water materialized out of it and, like Alden, start to strike at the arrows and knock some of them out of the air. They weren't quite as effective as the assassin, but there were enough of them to make a noticeable difference and give Jun time to breathe.", "1504757743000": "\"Ouch- I am going to k- ouch I'm going- ouch, OUCH, GRRRRRR-\"I'm going to kick this jerk's a-OUCH!At first Jun's water defense only intensified. More and more tendrils of water flailed out and started furiously swiping at the arrows. It was as if she was being protected by an angry water squid.Jun's head rattled with the constant clanging of arrows against metal and scale, and more arrows found purchase in the cloth parts of her armor. The armor would protect her vitals completely, and even the cloth would not allow any arrows to penetrate to the muscle or blood vessels, but they were still extremely painful. If she wasn't already a pin cushion, she looked like she was wearing them.\"Ouch! Why does- OUCH! WHY DOES THIS ROOM HATE ME?!\"Wait a second, why does this room hate me?She was beginning to for a hypothesis. What if the arrows were somehow homing in on her magic? After all, Alden had moved to defend her, meaning that she was the first target. And he wasn't trying to protect Imrahil, which mean she was probably ok too. That lightning flash definitely came from her.Going against all her instincts, she focused on shutting off her spell and dulling Resonance's light...", "1504829608000": "\"Ah tihtihtihtihtih.\" Jun's face squirmed as she rose up from her crouching position. She was alive, and not critically injured. But there were a bunch of arrows sticking out of the cloth close to her ribs, armpits, the flesh above and below her elbow, and bits of her lower leg. She started to pull the arrows out one by one, something which would take a few minutes. She didn't bother healing herself just yet (since doing so at the moment was suicide anyways), but were she to take a look at her skin underneath, she'd see lots of cuts with a single drop of blood growing under each one, and purple welts begin to form.\"That... is a very -ouch- clever trap. I was wary of anti-magic. But it never occurred to me that a trap could -ouch- react to light. Dammit.\"She looked around, her eyes somewhat adjusted to the low light. \"The worst part is, if he's here, he definitely knows we're here too. And since the volley lasted a long time and ended with a blast, he'll know we survived. Ack goddamnit... Hey, have any of you ever been attacked by a porcupine or stepped on a cactus before?\"", "1504966610000": "With a bit of effort and annoyance, Jun started removing some of her armor manually to reveal her damaged skin. \"Well, anyways, I don't recommend ever getting attacked by a porcupine. It's actually a little worse than this if you can believe that. It's a shame too. Porcupines are quite adorable.\"She carefully took some of the poultice that Imrahil offered her. \"Ah, thank you.\" She was grateful, but also thought bitterly how easily she could heal the wounds on her own under different circumstances.When she was done, she started putting her armor back on. \"Not gonna lie, now that I know what to expected I'm tempted to try to destroy those traps... Eh, nevermind. Too risky.\"", "1505093851000": "Jun finished slathering the poultice on her skin and was in the middle of putting her armor back on. \"What I don't want is for him to escape if he's here. But then again he could have a trap ready for us. Maybe we should deal with his assets first. If he has students here, we should rescue them or restrain them before taking him head on... So I guess I vote for the living quarters.\"When she was done putting on her armor again, she closed her eyes and focused. Alden would sense magical energy circulating through her body. She'd raise her hand, letting him know not to panic. When she opened them, they gave off a very faint red glow that was insufficient to trigger the traps. She was also able to see a bit better.\"There's a school of magic,\" she hissed, \"that emits little to no light. But I'm not as proficient in it as I used to be.\" Both Kaylie and Alden might suddenly feel a bit more uneasy and anxious around her. But it wouldn't be difficult to overcome the sensation.", "1505188698000": "\"So he did this to seven people.\" Jun said with disgust as they began to explore the rooms.She couldn't imagine what Alden was going through, or what it was like to be deprived of a normal childhood. Jun had grown up with somewhat primitive, tribal trappings, but she had a good family that went out of their way to NOT traumatize her. Most of the psychological damage she had suffered had been self-inflicted, due to jealousy and a thirst for power. When she saw the kitchen, the dining area, the wash closet, the bathroom, she thought to herself that this man could have given these kids a nice, normal, even convenient life, instead of the sick alternative he chose.Something about the seven bunk beds hurt the most, the thought of seven innocent children lying in these beds, only to wake up to the process of being turned into weapons. Even in her current state, she could sense Alden's suffering, and reached up a hand to his shoulder.\"He's gonna pay Alden.\" She said. \"He has to. We have to bring him to justice. He's gonna pay.\"Her last words were said with an angry, almost animalistic tone, with a supernatural echo.", "1505273842000": "Something interesting happened. The dark aura that Jun was emitting faltered, almost to the point of non-existence.\"That wasn't your fault, ok?\" She said softly as she caressed his shoulder. \"It was your master. He did this. You were innocent.\"Then suddenly the aura spiked again, and Jun's voice became sharper and more malevolent. \"It's all the more reason we need to bring him to justice. We need to focus.\"", "1505402604000": "So that was Imrahil's story. Jun grew wide eyed, and thin curls of malice extended from her aura, about to embrace the archer. But nothing would happen. Jun trusted Alden enough to know what he was doing. This person was on the path to redemption. She was sure of it, and she could sympathize. That said Jun suddenly had a very strong desire to torch something, the bipolar nature of her spell influencing her mood somewhat.And not a minute later did Alden have just what the doctor ordered.Jun smiled sadistically as she sauntered to the doorway. \"With pleasure. Just take a step back, wait seven seconds and try not to stare directly into the room.\" She raised the palm of her hand towards the center of the study. The others would hear a faint hissing sound in the background. \"Also you guys might feel short of breath for a few seconds. I don't know why but it'll pass.\"Alden would sense magical energy billowing out of Jun's finger tips like clouds of vapor. The energy would rapidly coat every surface and enter every crevice of the room, even the spaces between books. Alden would have a very short window where he could change his mind.If uninterrupted the three of them would feel a sudden blast of hot air and be bathed in a violent, raging blue light. The insides of the room would shudder and crack with the presence of deadly blue white flames voraciously eating anything not made of stone or metal. The roar would be almost deafening. A few seconds later the flames would vanish and everything in the room would be turned into blackness and ash.The room would then be ominously quiet and empty, although thin ribbons of smoke would start to rise up and curl about.\"Ah I haven't done that in a while.\" Jun would say with a certain satiated lust.", "1505506686000": "Jun heard Alden's explanation and then looked back at the smoldering room. \"I see. Well, let's not forget he's just a man. Flesh and blood. And even the most gifted blood burns in fire.\"She stretched her arms out and rotated her neck, which made a little pop. \"I vote training room next.\"A few seconds later, there was a slight dip in the intensity of Jun's dark aura and she asked, \"Was that a cool line? You know, with the whole setting the room on fire and burning and, and, you know what nevermind let's just focus.\"", "1505530086000": "If the beds were the most painful thing for Alden to see, then the torture section of the room was the most visceral for Jun. Her fist balled tightly around Resonance's hilt, and a deadly hiss escaped her nostrils. Her aura intensified and obliviated Alden's emotional needs from her consciousness. Instead her mind had become possessed with the images of screaming children, but the darkness also made her forget how to cry.The sand golems had picked a bad time to fuck with her.She turned to face them, wide-eyed and nostrils flaring. Immediately out of the darkest corners of the room sprang forth slick, oily black arms of unnatural elasticity and strength. Their hands were scaly and their fingertips were topped with lustrous claws of obsidian. About four in total, all four of them focused on the golem on the far left. They wrapped around it and attempted to constrict it from the bottom up. Its upper half would be surrounded by the appendages' deadly fingers, which would claw and thrash and tear at where the golem's face would be.Even while this was happening, Jun would reach into her pouch and pull out a single, ordinary looking seed, and take careful, measured steps away from the party and the other golems. She trusted her teammates to fight the other two. She intended to entertain herself with this one.", "1505762309000": "Jun raised her buckler and backed off as more golems began to ascend from the pit. She nodded gratefully at Alden for watching her back, and then swung her arm back to block a blow from another golem using her buckler. In the same motion she drew Resonance and stabbed\u00a0 the attacking golem right through where its heart would be. A shrill whine and a pulse of mana later and four more golems behind the attacker would go flying back. Before they can hit the ground, the shadow claws Jun had summoned would appear behind them and impale them from back to front with black obsidian claws.\"Clever little spell.\" Jun says as she takes her seed and tosses it into one of the pits. \"But if this guy thinks he can best me in magic he's got another thing coming.\"Jun would continue to fight the golems in the background while the seed's power took effect. As soon as it touched the sand pit, its outer shell would tear open and thin roots and vines would rapidly expand outward and propagate across the pit's entrance. It would use the sand as nourishment by extending thin filaments from its roots to grip the individual sand particles, while its vines became larger and stronger. The sand particles would find it increasingly difficult to make it to the sand pit so they could recharge, while the golems already in the pit would start to struggle to escape.The sand pits were basically recycling water fountains. Jun realized all they had to do was clog the drain.", "1505835297000": "Jun was able to thwart charges of golems with pulses of mana, and impale them with Resonance and the shadow claws. But she too  noticed as the golems seemed to be learning from their opponents. In Jun's case they started to avoid charging her directly and instead focused on flanking her and covering each other's backs, which confused the shadow claws. Her mana pulse was telegraphed by a shrill whir which they learned to identify and dodge. A few of them even started focusing on using long spears to counter her sword and buckler. At first Jun was overwhelming them, but now they were keeping up and starting to land glancing blows.To make matters worse her vines were starting to fall apart.Jun shuffled over to her own pit entrance to try to fix her vines. That's when she noticed the power source at the bottom of the pit.\"D'oh.\" She said to herself when she realized her own vines would make the power source harder to reach. Oh well. It was a start at least.\"Hey, Kaylie!\" She cried. \"Can you fire an explosive arrow right down to the bottom of a pit? There's something down there that needs blowing u-\"Jun rolled to the side as another golem came at her. She hoped Kaylie heard her as she engaged in battle once again.", "1506052216000": "\"Ack, got it!\" Jun cried as she just barely managed to take down another golem. But by now the golems were on to all her tricks.But maybe that wasn't a bad thing.\"Ok, if this works, you'll get a few seconds. Hold on.\" Jun positioned herself next to Kaylie, and her shadow claws began to defend the pair against flanking attacks. This time they would go for tripping and holding back the golems instead of impaling them. Killing them wasn't as important as giving Kaylie her precious window of opportunity.Jun aimed Resonance at the two pits. \"Remember this!?\" She cried. The air shrieked around the sword, a warning of an especially powerful impending pulse.The golems by now were well-conditioned to dodge out of the way, creating a clear path between Kaylie and two of the pits. \"Do it!\"", "1506218343000": "\"UGH! Awwwww...\"Being tackled by man with super strength was never a pleasant experience, although it sure beat the alternative in this case. She figured it was better to have her diaphragm compressed than to have her everything else flattened. \"Ugh, thanks.\" She quickly got up and leered at the behemoth. \"Well, my first instinct-\"All four shadow hands appeared by her side, and lunged straight for the creature's heart. If the creature was anything like its smaller counterparts, a fatal blow would cause it to collapse and reform, which would buy them more time to think.", "1506296943000": "\"Fair enough, I can't maintain this power anymore anyways. Thanks fellas.\"Two of the shadow claws gave each other a high five. One gave Jun a thumbs up, and the last one flipped off the sand golem. Then they retreated into the shadows, this time for good. Jun breathed a sigh of relief, and the whole room would feel a bit warmer. Her dark aura had been reduced to the bit that let her see in the dark, and nothing more.For her next trick, she held her palms out towards the behemoth. \"Kaylie, you think you can hit that thing's head with either an explosive or lightning arrow in about, oh, seven seconds? Six seconds? Five...\"Kaylie wouldn't see what was happening, but she would hear the same hissing sound as when Jun had incinerated the room. Alden would spot a gush of invisible mana flowing from Jun's finger tips towards the creature. It would quickly coat the golem like syrup, and an especially thick concentration of it would envelope its head like a helmet. If he recalled what happened to the torched room, he'd know that he needed to get ready to retreat.If Kaylie fired the arrow, not only would there be a powerful blast focused around the creature's head, but the intense heat and flames would likely turn a good portion of the golem into glass.\"THREE, TWO, ONE...\" Jun shouted the last three numbers to give Alden one last warning.", "1506539231000": "\"Eh, grrr.\" Jun turned red faced as she looked back at the golem pits. She then sighed and relaxed her shoulders. \"I'll try not to take it personally. I guess I need another lesson in humility from Lum'Valia.\"She walked over to the last pit, which was surrounded by melted glass. If the crystal was still there, she'd blast it into smithereens with a fireball launched from her hands.\"Well, Pride cometh before the fall, but that expression doesn't say whose fall now does it?\" She'd then rejoin her comrades, still a bit tense. She almost forgot that she ought to congratulate their resident archer. But with the dark aura gone, she was feeling more benevolent and less pissy. \"Good shot by the way.\" She lightly punched Kaylie's shoulder.", "1506814362000": "\"Maybe... Let me try. If I can't see it maybe I can sense its magic.\" Jun cautiously stood next to Alden and peered down the hallway.aYFgW8rI1-201-20", "1507077868000": "\"Uh, oh, ok.\"Jun considered herself lucky beyond measure that she was able to spot the traps. However, getting past them was another matter. Her armor, which had saved her against the arrows before, threatened to set off the tripwire if she tried to step over it. She somewhat clumsily reached down and tried to pull up her thick cloth skirt flaps. However, they were stubborn to fold and her tassets got in the way.\"Grr, come on. Come on. I refuse to die to a wardrobe malfunction.\" She hissed to herself as she struggled.After a few tense seconds, she managed to fold the flaps inward and hold on to them well enough so that she could finally step over the trip wire. She felt a bit silly, like a maiden not wanting to get her dress wet. But with that out of the way the pressure plate proves much simpler. She followed Alden's path as best she could.", "1507165186000": "\"...\"Time seemed to slow down.The world briefly flashed white.Jun made a soft squeaking noise at the same pitch as a tea kettle.She had experienced many, many things in her relatively short life, and she expected to experience many more things. Being molested by a metal spear was not one of those things.She quickly got over that nasty surprise when she realized she and Kaylie were about to die. Fortunately, her armor had prevented any real damage. She struggled to climb, hop, and scramble over the deadly implements, ignoring any gashes or bruises they inflicted on her body. As soon as she was clear she reached for a particular scroll she had with her. \"Alden, catch!\" She tossed the scroll straight towards him and then started to run as fast as she could, leaping over any additional pressure plates she could spot. She makes sure to pause at the point where Alden was almost bisected before darting forward even faster.The scroll was a bit of insurance in case she or Kaylie weren't able to make it to the end in time...", "1507513400000": "As soon as Alden made it past the doorway, his scroll would begin to glow. There was a brief flash of light, too brief for the arrow trap to trigger, and suddenly Jun and Kaylie would disappear.They would reappear right next to Alden, flanking him on either side. Their appearance would not trigger any light; the effects of this form of teleportation were a brief blur in the air followed by a wooshing sound. Jun collapsed on her knees and fell on her hands, partially because she was the least athletically inclined person in the group, and partially because-\"Aw that fucking spear nailed me right in the... UGGGGHHHH!\" Her face contorted in pain and she\u00a0slammed her palm on the floor. She turned to Alden. \"I swear the first thing I'm gonna do to Pride is kick him right in the... Alden?\"That was when she noticed the darts, and the fact that the man who could probably shake off a ripped out kidney was lying in pain on the floor. \"Oh no.\" Forcing herself to ignore her own physical plights, she reached a hand over to him and prepared to use healing magic. But then she stopped. Her fingers curled and tensed. \"I... I don't know what to do. I'm not as good with poison as other injuries and if there's a light arrow trap in here we're all gonna die. Uh...\" She stared wide-eyed at Alden's neck helplessly, her hand shaking.", "1507675435000": "The only thing Jun could think of was taking out the darts, which she did. She was careful to keep them in order in case their corresponding location to the wounds yielded any clues. Jun's knowledge of poisons and human anatomy weren't comparable to Kaylie's, but she did notice two things. One, Alden was having trouble moving and responding, and two, his wounds weren't bleeding as much as they should have been.She handed Kaylie the darts spread out on her palm. \"This is the order I found them in. Uh, I'm not sure but I think one of them is a sedative, or maybe it's a neurotoxin I'm not sure, and the other some kind of coagulant. The rest I don't have any clue.\"", "1507763268000": "\"If there's a light trap in here... Well I'm willing to try magic healing as a last resort. And no I can't read m-\"Wait, I don't have to.\"Hold on.\" She tapped the telepathy crystal on her neck that Lady Naoki had given to her favorites, including Jun and Alden. Then she pat\u00a0down Alden's body until she found his Sun Marshall badge, where he kept his. Then he placed it in Alden's hand.Why didn't I think of this before? Alden, can you hear me? Please tell me your symptoms in detail so I can relay them to Kaylie.", "1507917077000": "Jun grinned widely as an intense feeling of relief washed over her. It wasn't over yet, now that she knew what was ailing Alden.She turned to Kaylie. \"Ok, I've got it. Devil's Snake venom, which is causing blood clots. Denner's extract mixed with, er, Carris extract. It's causing kidney failure. What the heck is an Azeran Jellyfish? Whatever, it's a neurotoxin. There all from the darts on his neck wounds, here. Also, I just thought of something else. I can probably use my magic to power up his healing runes without causing any visible light. So even if you don't have a lot of anti-venom, we can still heal him together.\"", "1508124289000": "... something which Jun happily obliged to. With Alden's runes on full blast, it was easy for her to sense their presence. She would gently lay her hands on them and funnel thin trickles of ambient energy into the runes, all while silently chanting to herself invocations pleading the elements to aid her in saving this man's life. The effect was so subtle that it produced very little visible light. If it was successful the runes would be temporarily enhanced by around 20%.(Posted because Jake told me to post again.)", "1508200015000": "Jun sat there amidst the broken wooden legs, odd-smelling chemicals, and shattered glass. Thin trails of steam rose from her gauntlets.She sat in thought, contemplating her bruised back and possible whiplash, cut up arms and legs, and electric tingling prickling throughout her body. \"Nope, spear to the crotch still hurts more.\"Jun groaned and got back up, dusting some little bits of glass from her armor and making sure nothing from the table was eating her equipment. Then, finally, she took the time to appreciate the room's contents while limping back to her party.Although, the fact that she was in a laboratory was now (literally) painfully obvious to her. ", "1508534527000": "Jun was very close to adopting a sarcastic, self-pitying air, having sustained more injuries at the hands of Pride's traps than any other foe she had met recently. But that quickly changed, everything changed, when she saw the actual bodies. Suddenly all those interviews with Alden, the blood stains on the floors, and the rumors, became real. It was disorienting, as if her eyes and brain hadn't quite agreed on what she was looking at. Even she, knowing herself, would have expected a sudden surge of blinding rage to come rushing out of her gut. But all that materialized there was a solid iron ball.\"Do you guys see any signs of traps near the bodies? I wanna go over and examine them.\" She said softly.", "1508856151000": "\"Yah... Yah you're right.\"It was a tough choice, but ultimately Jun decides to side with Kaylie. Still, there was a few seconds delay between her acknowledgment and her actually tearing her gaze away from the bodies. \"I mean, someone should do an autopsy on them at some point, but I'd be lying if I said I was qualified.\" She made a distinct sniffing sound and then turned her attention to Alden and his books. \"So what are we looking for anyways?\"", "1509152338000": "\"... No problem. Just, it'll take a little longer to cast. This is a larger room so... Just trust me.\"Jun waited until they were out of the door. Then she turned around to stand a few meters away from the entrance. \"We'll need to stay further back. The residual effect will be more intense. Also, it would be best not to look inside.\" She held her hands up. And once again Alden would sense mana billowing out from her fingers like clouds and coat everything in the room. The process took more than a few seconds, so Jun had time to stare at the dangling feet and limbs hidden under the sheets one last time.No... no thoughts of violence. No anger. Not this time. She told herself.Jun closed her eyes and bowed her head as a sudden, violent blue-white light erupted from the entrance. This time a thick wall of warm air flew through the once deadly hallway and washed over all three of them. Jun's tassets jostled slightly, but otherwise, she stood stoically as the violent flames did their work. A few seconds later, it was over. The flames disappeared with a woosh, and the remaining room was caked in blackness. Jun turned around and said, \"It's done.\" The room seemed to spring to life again as thin ribbons of smoke started to sprout up from what was left of the furniture, and the bodies.\"Alright. Let's keep going then.\" Jun followed Kaylie and Alden through the rest of the hallway. She didn't make eye contact with anyone.", "1509854743000": "Jun utterly froze. She didn't want to believe it, but if that was who she thought it was, any sudden movement on her part would get her killed. She waited and allowed them to speak, as if she had a choice.What she felt was a peculiar feeling. Again, she would have expected herself to feel some sort of blinding rage, to gnash her teeth and threaten to set them on fire. But instead, their presence hardly seemed real. It was just so ludicrous that anyone so evil and horrible could exist, and that their situation could be so utterly hopeless. The absurdity of it all and the pretty much instant resolution that there was nothing they could do gave her an odd sort of courage.\"Hi.\" Jun said with a slight lean forward. \"I know I'm not important and I have nothing to do with this, but I just want to chime in and say that I recently took a spear to the privates and I'm in a really bad mood. I'm also fully aware that if you wanted us dead we would be dead already, like completely and totally sliced up like ham. Therefore I'm going to ask what you want from us. However, again, you want us alive, and I'm going to use that as leverage to air my grievances. So here it goes. You suck. You are a horrible human being. You are lower than dirt. I think your theme is stupid. I think your mask is stupid. I think your books are stupid. I think all of you belong in a circus instead of running around knocking off nations. I refuse to call any of you by your names. I need more time to think of nicknames but Gluttony, you're going to be known as Gorilla Hips.\"Jun sighed. If she was going to die, she was ok with her last words being Gorilla Hips. \"... What do you want, Pride?\"", "1510211683000": "Jun didn't know how to respond to that. He wasn't wrong. She decided just to keep silent until he finished talking.As soon as the abominations disappeared, Jun turned to Alden and saw what had become of his mental state. She reached up to touch his shoulder. \"Alden... he's gonna pay. It's ok. We can stop him... we can.\"She hardly believed her own words. She let go. \"Let's just go outside...\"...Once they were all outside, Jun took off her helmet and carefully set it on the ground. Then she drew out the sword Resonance. She stared at the shimmering blue blade and saw that there were tears streaming down her cheeks. She turned around towards the keep. Once again the reality of the interviews she had done with Alden, the bodies she saw, they barely seemed real. But they were, and quite frankly that just... wasn't fair.\"He doesn't even deserve a name...\"", "1510607278000": "She sheathed her sword.She wiped her tears.She furiously scratched her head and pressed her temples with her palms, struggling to think of something to say, to make herself and Alden feel better.\"Maybe it's too soon for this but... we're gonna beat them, alright Alden? We'll train. We'll get stronger. We'll think of a plan, a trap, anything. But we'll beat them. He won't get away with this.\"She took a deep breath and raised her arms out. \"Hold on.\" There was a flash of light and Jun was wearing a new outfit, a simple sleeveless white shirt, and short brown shorts. With this outfit, all her lacerations and bruises were now visible. \"Oh damn...\" She winced at her own damaged limbs. At least there was the sense of relief of being able to indulge in healing magic without being turned into a pin cushion. Jun ran her healing hands on her arms and legs (and other areas)as if she was applying a sort of glowing lotion. The cuts started to seal, and the bruises fade. The blood dried and flecked off like pepper flakes.While she did this she said, \"I'm so... angry right now, so furious, that I wish I was back to using blood and demon magic. I just wish I could wreck this entire fort. But, I think that's going to be one of the challenges of fighting these guys, fighting them while retaining who we are, without stooping to his level. We're only alive because he wants to play with us. I wanna beat them while still being a holy mage. Kaylie, you should beat him as a sun marshal, not a bandit. And Alden... well, you know.\"As soon as she was done, she suddenly thought back to the bodies in that room, and the torture chamber.\"Ugh that FUCKING ASSHOLE!\" Jun suddenly turned around and launched a one-armed fireball at the walls of the decrepit fort. The attack impacted with a crack of mortar and brick and sent bits of debris scattering across the grass. She fired another one, and another, and another, gradually chipping away at various parts of the keep. \"Piece... of shit! Child... torturing... GRRRR!\"Her last fireball took a pretty decent chunk out of the highest tower.", "1478463044000": "While the pair was speaking, Jun was completely and utterly entranced by the fuzzy flying fawn. It took her a second to regain her composure and participate in the conversation. Without even properly responding to her acknowledgement, she exclaimed, \"May I pet him?\"Assuming she was allowed, she would very gently get down one knee and reach out a hand, giving the creature a chance to acclimate to her scent. She wasn't a beast master, but as a Land-Tiller she had some experience dealing with animals. The fact that she had bathed recently and gave off a slight lavender scent might also work to her advantage.In any case, Jun would also chime in during the two ladies' conversation. \"I'm here to vouch for Grandma's honor. She is a friend of our nation and has aided in its defense recently. She is an exceedingly powerful, but benevolent being. She's known for her curiosity and pursuit of knowledge.\"", "1480386961000": "The biggest smile Jun had ever smiled creased on her face. Something so adorable should be illegal! With quick but delicate steps, like a rapid tiptoe, Jun heeded the little fawn and chased after him. As they bounced around the field, Jun occasionally stole glances at Grandma and the Winged Crown. For the most part she trusted Grandma to know how to carry herself, but there was always a part of her ready to butt in, just in case. After all, it was because of her that Grandma had been allowed here in the first place.Their running around had eventually evolved into a sort of game of tag. She was surprised by how intelligent the creature was.When Grandma offered her assistance to their people, Jun turned to them curiously, just as the fawn bopped her on the head.\"Huh, guess they'll be a Black Tower here soon after all,\" she said to herself.The fawn bleated playfully.Jun leered at it, then bleated back and grinned.", "1480633129000": "\"Uh, Grandma?\" Jun said as she was being externally hydrated by the fawn's gyrations. \"If you don't need my help further I'd like to get back home. I've got a lot to do. In fact you might be interested in knowing that the Earthwarden is teaching me druidic magic. But I've got to practice. My plants keep exploding for some reason.\"It'd be funny if it wasn't true.In any case Jun rubbed the fawn's adorable face and bid it farewell, assuming she would be allowed to return home.", "1469679612000": "Jun came in just behind the other heroes. Her magic had expired, but she was just outside the valley.\"What the hell is this place?\"By now it should be obvious that fire and holy magic were the ways to go, so Jun raised Resonance into the  air again and waved it around. Trails of heat and flames flew off of it, and lashed out at the mist close by. The amount of mana around her was growing rapidly. (C1)", "1470291755000": "Jun had been waiting for an appropriate time to strike, and the promise of Asadobres' blistering light attack had given her an idea. Quickly Jun prodded Blackbean with her heel. \"Get to that young dragon, go!\"The beast carried her as fast as he could. She knew she only had moments for this plan to work. She continued to gather mana and arrived just in time to bear witness to the Leiron's blistering light attack from just a short distance away.***A few months earlier, in Isra's Central Plaza.Fractured though patterns would be expelled from his mind, reaching the nearby people. His centuries of knowledge would ooze out, telling everybody of all manner of spells, forbidden, powerful spells. It was not dangerous, but instead would interfere with minds, muddling thoughts. Magicians may fare better against it however, even gathering knowledge from this.One could most likely decipher the thought patterns of the unconscious God and find a spell of great value, and great destructive power. These older spells would of course need more careful use, as they may cause serious damage if they backfire.Only if one could understand the dragonic language, however.***The spell the ancient one had inadvertently taught her was a fire spell which consumed all the oxygen in a wide radius. One of her grandmother's spell did something similar by releasing flammable gas into the air and igniting it, so it wasn't long before she was able to master this ancient forbidden art. Of course, Jun had no intention of suffocating all the allies just to defeat the behemoth. In fact, she didn't even intend to strike the creature directly.\"Fire Art: Bane of Breath!\" Jun swung her sword around several times and flames appeared in midair, lapping around Blackbean's wings. With another almighty swing forward the flames exploded into a torrent, which rushed out to the sides with a loud woosh. Asadobres and Leiron  would find themselves bathed in a warm orange glow as they were flanked by the flames, which careened towards the behemoth.A caveat to her spell was that, as she hadn't had much time to charge it, and it was her first time casting it, it lacked any significant destructive power. However, by nature its area of effect was substantial, enough to encompass the beast in a thin membrane of flames for just a few seconds. Would it harm the behemoth? Not at all. But it would prevent the miasma from reaching the creature and healing it, creating a very brief window of opportunity for another combatant(s) to launch an additional powerful attack with impunity...", "1493841861000": "Jun could only imagine how the lizard men were reacting to Zemp's garish intrusion. The metal carriage sure was a wonder, and a testament to Isra's engineering and economic potency. But by god was it ugly.She wasn't quite within visual range of the patrols. She was still ways off, playing leapfrog with whatever tree cover she could find. But as she got closer, she was beginning to sense the distinct lack of vitality and life coming from the camp. This was the sum of the anti-magic measures that were being employed in the camp. The life energy that granted her power fled from these measures, like an offense smell. It was sort of like the inverse of a candle in pure darkness, only instead of darkness fleeing, it was the earth's magical energies.And thanks to her training in Va'nei's valley, she could sense it like radar.The large crow she had ridden concealed itself up in a tree, in its compact form. Blackbean remained vigilant while Jun did her thing, his little black head swiveling about. He would give a crowish cry as soon as he sensed danger.Hiding behind a tree, Jun began to plant the seeds of a rare plant that grew in the Expanse. This was an old trick she had learned since she was little, but Va'nei's training had greatly augmented the proficiency of this skill, even as far as giving these already useful plants a little boost in their design.When she was satisfied with the depth of the seeds, she stood up. She looked around her to make sure there were no patrols nearby. Then she relaxed, took a deep breath, and extended her fingers towards the ground.The seeds began to sprout into saplings...", "1494308558000": "Throughout the chattering and failed negotiations at the camp, Jun had been pouring powerful druidic magic onto the growing organisms through her fingertips. By the time hell started to break loose in the camp, Jun had made something rather neat.The saplings had formed into a writhing bush, bearing big, bulbous seed pods filled with small holes. A trypophobe's nightmare, the seed pods were none-the-less extremely useful. Jun hastily (and carefully) plucked the seed pods from the plant and placed them in a sack she had on her. She took a moment to observe what was happening at the camp from behind her tree cover.\"Ooohhhh... Crap.\" She made a little click to bring Blackbean down. \"Time to go big guy.\" Blackbean hopped down onto the grass. As he did so his body grew to a large, rideable size. A plated, avian form of cataphract armor, originally the size of a coffee mug, had grown along with him. Jun quickly hopped on, dangling the pouch of seed pods to her side.Blackbean took off into the air, and headed towards the air space over the bandit camp.", "1522632782000": "It didn't take long for Jun to decide that this was a place for a nice morning stroll. She had seen many forests before, but this one in particular had character. And while she was already getting into the swing of things as a city girl once again, her Land-Tiller side was gazing optimistically at the large fungi; who knew what possibilities the plants of the forest held for cultivation? Especially ones designed for low level light conditions.\u00a0She wasn't quite as into the hunting of game as her young partner; her mind kept alighting with thoughts of cave farms filled with giant glowing mushrooms. But she did have the presence of mind to offer one bit of advice:\"Hey, Keph. If you're feeling daring, you can use dark magic to give you night vision. Might help hit that prize deer... or bear... or whatever.\"Sitting on the shoulder of her unassuming brown cloak was of course Blackbean, who was watching Keph with absolute silence; there was no occult mystery to this. He just didn't want to ruin his concentration.\u00a0", "1522641059000": "Bells and baking? Jun was happy to encounter signs of amicable company in a forest like this. After all, highway men and gnolls didn't typically ring bells and bring baked goods into the middle of nowhere. Although, that did sort of beg the question: what exactly did those\u00a0aforementioned things? Exactly?...Apparently sapient well-dressed dormice.Jun's eyes followed the creature as it skittered along and then used Keph as a trampoline.Then the bunny ears sprouted, and Jun's mouth slowly gaped open.Without saying a word, she took some steps forward towards Keph, outstretched her hand, and gently caressed one of the ears from its base to its tip, in awe of it as if it was made of gold leaf.\"What the fuck?\" She whispered before looking back in the direction of the dormouse.", "1522643777000": "Jun quickly retracted her hand and looked on flat-faced as Keph wrote out his rebuke with astonishing speed. His reaction actually helped her process the fact that she wasn't going crazy, which was a mild relief.\"I mean... That's sort of true. But if mine were as cute and fuzzy as these I wouldn't hold it against you.\" She smirked. \"Anyways, yah sorry, we should chase after it.\" She followed Keph's original lead to chase after the dormouse. Assuming Keph ran along with her, she would say while running, \"By the way... I can probably get rid of them but... I'm a lot more curious about... where a mouse learned... transfiguration magic... What do you think? ... You can't write while running nevermind...\"Blackbean took the skies and started flying at a low altitude along with Keph and Jun. He wasn't particularly alarmed. He had traveled with her long enough to see this as just one of those days.", "1522770487000": "\"Ouch! Heeeeey, learn to take a compliment, guy.\"Keph's ability to write while running through the forests impressed her. The fact that he could write even neater than her while at full gallop however was downright disturbing. Even as they chased after the dormouse she contemplated what it would take to start some sort of talent show in Isra. Of course her mom would probably enter and shoot a cork off someone's head at fifty paces. Gods the winter festival was embarrassing. Stupid snow balls. I fought a friggin' ice dragon and I still can't throw a damn snowba-Jun almost ran into the wardrobe.She was able to stop thinking about how her mother probably wanted a boy for just a second and confront the wardrobe. Well that was odd. Maybe it was being transported as part of a caravan and fell off? Ironic that Jun the powerful mage had thought of the most mundane explanation for the object, which she started to circle curiously.Before she could say anything, Keph had already leaped into the wardrobe. Although she did sense magic coming from it, her expectation was still that he would rush in and get tangled up in some coats. But at least maybe he would flush out the little magic mouse! To that end she readied her mana for a spell to catch the mouse... which in retrospect she probably should have done in the first place. Oh well. ", "1522982343000": "Jun canceled her spell with a shake of the wrist as soon as she heard Keph yelp. If the wardrobe permitted, a surge of psionc energy would shove the coats to the sides, carving a little tunnel through which she could pass. And that is how she would discover that the wardrobe kept going... and going and going.\"Huh... Blackbean, what do you think?\"*... Caw caw caw*\"Agreed.\" Jun decided to go with a leap of faith and rush into the wardrobe after her friend. Blackbean would follow along, gliding in just behind her.(It should be noted that at one point she would wonder if Keph had also pulled out his journal and wrote AAAAAHHHH as he was falling. She quickly dismissed these thoughts however when she realized thinking them likely made her an awful person.)", "1523681512000": "The more time passed, the faster Jun ran. She went from mildly amused to genuinely fearful, with visions of a completely transformed Keph hopping around haplessly, staring at a journal he could no longer utilize due to lack of opposable thumbs. As adorable a fate as it was, it was also too tragic to bear. She spurred herself to run faster through the coats until finally she entered the hut.She came bursting out of the last coat as if it had just given violent birth. \"Keph?!\" There was no one, only a warm fire and sugar cookies. Blackbean fluttered in just behind her. She felt her psionic energy lose its grip on the coats behind her. Fearing she had fallen victim to antimagic, she swiveled around to find that the coats had simply disappeared, a feat which likely required magic of some kind.\"Oooookay then.\" Somewhat relieved, she swiveled back and decided to look around the room for anything else of interest, particularly a window. She decided to not eat the cookies quite just yet. She wanted to get her bearings first. And assuming there was nothing overly engrossing within the room, (or anything monstrous outside the window that may or may not exist) she would then try to take a peak outside.If there were any powerful sources of magic or anti-magic nearby, she would sense those as well.Blackbean would hop onto the table to examime the cookies more closely. Food? Caw?", "1524250190000": "Jun sighed as she gazed out at the pasture. She folded her arms and leaned her shoulder against the door frame. \"It's such a nice artificial day.\"There was no sign of Keph. Whoever or whatever had brought them here must have excelled at portal magic, a skill she wasn't very adept at. Either that or they excelled at illusion magic, another skill she didn't exactly put time in practicing. They definitely had transmutation down, something else which she-\"Wow I am really starting to regret being so narrow-minded in my youth. I literally spend most of my life learning how to blow things up.\"Now feeling a bit depressed, she decided she had no choice but to relax and play along.She turned around and walked over to Blackbean and the cookies. \"Alright. I'll bite... literally... heheheh... heh... ehhhhhhh.\"\"Caw.\"\"Shut up Blackbean.\" She reached down and examined a cookie. When she was satisfied that it wasn't poisonous, she'd start nibbling on them.", "1524443471000": "One last time, Jun skeptically scrutinized the curious confection. The warmth was welcome in this world of whimsy. She felt that Blackbean would have picked up on any pernicious potions concealed in the cookie. And she, a mage, did not sense any malevolent magic.One she decided she was done alliterating to herself, she went ahead and took a bite.\"Mmm... These are good.\" She handed a bit to Blackbean, who took up the crumb in his beak.\"These are really good.\" She took another bite. And another, and another, until she had stuffed the whole thing in her mouth....The dreams of a different time, a delightful demon chef who dwelled in the Midnight Sun, an unparalleled paragon of culinary composition. His works had known no equal until today.So... good... Can't... stop... alliterating!After it was finished making claw marks underneath the table, her hand darted for the plate once again when suddenly she heard the knock on the door.\"... Why?\" She wimpered.She sighed (loudly) and turned to the door. As she strode over, she finally began to feel the waves of comfort and relaxation that made her want to take a nap, waves which had been temporarily overriden by her oral orga-\"Can I help you?\" She stuck her head out to get a bettet look at who or what these queen's guards were.", "1525101706000": "Jun's eyes of course went straight to the hat, then to the doll, then to the man's moustache. It was actually the doll that interested her the most in a pragmatic sense. What kind of soldier used a doll for a weapon? It must have been a focus of some kind, like her sword or harness, or a traditional staff. A doll was an interesting choice for one of those... Then it was back to the mustache.She nodded her head politely until he was finished.\"That's a long story... is what I would say if it was actually a long story, because now that I think about it it's actually not a long story at all. I was traveling through a forest with my friend Keph, a boy with white hair and a notebook that he speaks through. He is very shy you see. We found a strange portal in the form of a closet, and next thing I know, here I am. Also would you like a cookie? They aren't mine but they're reaaally good.\"She cleared her throat and opened the door wider, revealing Blackbean, who was likely pecking voraciously at one of the cookies. \"Come on, Blackbean.\" Assuming the crow wasn't adversely effected by the treat, he'd flutter along and sit on her shoulder.\"Oh, I should...\" Not one to be a cookie thief, she reached into her robe and pulled out a bag filled with semi-precious stones. These were still used as currency among some Land-Tiller clans who hadn't fully adapted to Isran currency. She found a piece of hematite, a black stone with a rainbow luster, about the size of a walnut. Thinking this was adequate payment for two cookies, she carefully placed it next to the plate. But as she did so, she made a subtle action with her hand which, from a distance would look like she was spinning the stone on the table just for fun. That was the goal actually, except she wasn't actually touching it. She was subtley testing to see if her magic still worked. \"Anyways, I don't mind heading into the Heartland if it helps me find Keph and get back, but what exactly is this war about?\"", "1525407841000": "\"Uh... Evidently I'm from somewhere far away.\" Jun looked around at her environment, still impressed by its beauty but increasingly insecure. \"Damn.\"Jun quickly realized how bad it would be to have to track down Keph if this region was going to be embroiled in a war. Then again, if he had perhaps wound up in another hut, he would also be evacuated too would he not? This heartland was likely the best place to search.But then again hearing about a war and a side that desperately needed help was giving her an itch to scratch. \"I doubt my homeland is any relevant. It's a tribal land that's also a protectorate in a larger empire. Uh, before I give any more details, I have a bizarre question. And I hope you won't take offense. This war, is it a fairly straight forward\u00a0 good guy bad guy affair or are the parties involved er... morally ambiguous? Why is the wizard coming after this place?\"Poor Blackbean held on tight to Jun's shoulder as he beheld the wonders of the effervescent cosmos.", "1525469481000": "\"Huh... I see.\" Jun put her hands in her pockets and stared at the road they were walking with a pensive intensity. Simplest things. What a bizarre and sad reason for a war, not even something deeply ingrained in the culture, based on the guard's response. \"Well... anyways, the land I come from is called the Isran Empire, and the protectorate is called the Land-Tiller's state. And yah, I found a closet in the middle of a forest. I suppose that sounds crazy but it's not like magic doesn't exist here. I only asked because I wouldn't mind helping, especially with the protection of innocent civil-\"This is about when Blackbean's frenetic flapping and screeching began. The crow earlier had cocked his head curiously at the mysterious new foe, and then processed the fact that crows weren't normally capable of telepathic communication, nor having buttons for eyes. He started cawing aggressively, but that caw turned into an almost dog like bark when the ink spilled onto Jun's shoulder. This was an insult! Keep your spittle to yourself you vile fiend! No one soils my partner's clothes but me!Jun instinctively turned in the opposite direction, expecting an attack of some kind. Blackbean was a better alarm than most dogs. Even seeing nothing, her eyes leered about, until she happened to take in just the right patch of sky...\"Keph?\" It hit her like a brick. What was Keph doing in the sky? And who was that girl about to kiss her?! Blackbean had good instincts about these things. Perhaps she was a malevolent being!\"Hey!\" She yelled up at the sky. The soldier would sense an aura of magical energy forming around her, an ornery electricity on a short fuse. \"Who are you and what are you doing with my friend?!\"Blackbean was a bit confused, but kept cawing aggressively to get the drooling phantasm off Jun's shoulder. ", "1525488509000": "Jun didn't mind boys falling for her. But this wasn't quite what she wanted.\"Damnit!\" She thrusted a hand up towards Keph, and if all went according to plan a surge of psionic energy would appear beneath Keph and absorb the weight of his fall like jello. He would feel the bouncy, violet-tinted, translucent energy caress him and slowly lower him down to the ground next to her. He'd hit the grass with a gentle plop as opposed to the bone-breaking crunch that would have befallen him. She then glared up at the floating dressy girl with all the annoyance her eyeballs could muster.Blackbean meanwhile had launched a full on feathery assault on the inky usurper. He had clamped his beak around a wrinkle of cloth just beneath Jun's shoulder blade where he perceived the epicenter of the spreading goo was located. He hung there, thrashing, determined to tear the goo off her robes.Jun was too busy giving the floating girl the classic woman's death stare to pay Blackbean much mind. He was probably trying to kill a spider or something. ", "1525668430000": "\"You don't let your bunny rabbits fall from a two story height. That is animal abuse at a minimum.\" She put her hands on her hips and looked cross, which was actually a step down from the look Jun was giving her before. Now she felt more like an angry parent. \"Now if Keph were a cat I could sort of understand but ouch what the pft pfft pff-\"Jun was interrupted by Blackbean assaulting her widows peak from the top of her head. He then lost his footing and was beating his wings against her face as he struggled to climb back up.\"Blickbin fur er yi pfft pfft pleh.\" She managed to grab a hold of Blackbean, who was cawing irately. Her two hands were gently clasped under his wings.\"Easy... Here. Hold him for a second. If you drop him he can fly.\" She handed Blackbean to the strange girl in an almost comical reversal of trust. Blackbean would continue to glare at Jun's face suspiciously, occasionally barking angrily.\"But if you try to steal him\u00a0 or try anything funny I'll turn you into a rosebush.\" Jun lied. She could tell her powers were weaker here, but they were still strong enough to bluff her way through most situations. She wondered if what was weakening her powers was also affecting Blackbean.\"Keph, are you alright? Are you hurt?\" She asked in a much softer tone. \"Was she the one that turned your ears? Want me to try to cure them?\"", "1525943223000": "Jun watched as Blackbean started cawing all around him, as if he were being swarmed by an invisible plague of gnats. Finally he seemed like he had had enough of this reality and fainted, his head instinctively retracting to the side as birds are wont to do when they sleep. Concerned, Jun crouched down and pet him while checking his vitals. Demon crows were exceptionally brave, resilient creatures with iron stomachs. It was odd that he would just freak out like that.\"Mmm, guess I know not to feed you cookies. At least I hope that's what it was.\" She continued to stroke him sadly for a bit. Then she turned and stared at the rude girl for a couple of seconds while rummaging through her pockets for something. When she found what she was looking for, she cocked her head and looked sideways. \"Well, I mean, I guess his ears are pretty damn cute. You know, it's really not a bad look for him, if you're into that sort of *gasp* what's that over there?!\"She pointed her fingers over at nothing with great shock and sincerity, then quickly flicked the seed at Keph's head with her thumb, where it would seem to stick to his flesh as it split and sprouted. Keph would recognize the vine as a sort of magic-killer, a druidic anti-magic tool. The parasitic vine feasted on foreign magic and spells, and as it sprouted it would start growing upwards towards Keph's head, gradually shrinking his rabbit ears and turning him back to normal. Directly correlated with the shrinking of the ears was the growth of a large purple flower that would smell of a musky lavender.While the vine did its thing, Jun would return to tending to Blackbean.", "1526309401000": "Jun gave a self-satisfied smirk that quickly fell into a disheartened stare. The vine was supposed to stop growing once it absorbed the spell's main effect, but instead it was still growing... and growing, and growing.\"Huh... this species of plant doesn't usually get this big. The rabbit ear spell must have been cast with powerful magic. ACK! IT TYPICALLY DOESN'T GROW TEETH EITHER!\"She walked up to the toppled pair. \"Yo! Hey! Uh, vine! Chill buddy!\" When it snapped towards Blackbean, Jun's hand darted out like lightning and smacked the fly trap straight on its waxy cellulose head. \"Hey! NO! Bad plant!\" Once again Jun had been forced into the role of angry parent.\"Uh, sorry guys, this thing shouldn't be getting that big. My magic is really wonky in this land. I hope it wasn't those cookies I ate.\" After getting Blackbean to a safe distance, Jun backed off and attempted to telekinetically removed the plant. She would start at the tip of the vines, where an unseen force would gently uncoil it. She didn't want to harm the plant. It was her child after all. But she would continue to psionically uncoil it until it loosened, to where she could sort of pop it off and lift it into the air in big bubble.She also would ask the guard, \"By the way, I noticed instead of a weapon you have a weird doll thing. Are you a spell caster of some kind too?\"", "1527471369000": "Jun felt an odd surge of determination when the strange girl leaned in for a kiss. Her face slightly red, she reached her hands out with increased fervor, her hair and clothing billowing with movement as she released more of her mana. She was going to pry this thing off if it was the last thing she did.And then this little harlot had the nerve to talk about restoring his ears! After all the trouble she just went through! She exerted even more mana.\"If you... don't start... calling him... by his... proper name... which is Keph... by the way... in case you didn't know... my fist... is going to... restore... your face!\"The fact that her threat made no logistical sense notwithstanding, she was exerting enough power to raise a castle's drawbridge. If her new pet didn't yield to her now, it wouldn't yield to anything.", "1528992189000": "*Pant, pant, pant**Pant, pant, pant*\"I hereby deem you shall be named... Mr. Carrot.\"*Pant, pant, pant*Jun collapsed on her butt and started stroking the back of Blackbean's head. With her powers only a fraction of what she was used to, she was beginning to find this world frustrating.She wiped her brow, then she started removing her robe. The air seemed to become uncomfortably humid. Underneath she wore some simple black slacks and a white cotton shirt. She took her robe and wiped off a bit more sweat.Keph might notice several minute scars dotting her bare arms for the first time.She looked in the direction of the storm and the strange cube. \"Ugh, well, if you don't know what it is then we are in trouble because I definitely don't know what it is.\" She strained her brow, trying to refer back to her grandmother's stories or the books in the Enclave or Isran library. When it was decided that it was time to leave, she reluctantly sat up. \"Sounds like a plan.\" With Blackbean under one arm and her robes under the other, she followed the guard's lead.\"You too Mr. Carrot.\" With a hand gesture the psionic bubble containing her new pet followed along with her.", "1530684981000": "Jun allowed herself to be led to the abandoned bar. As she trotted along, she periodically stole glances back at the cube-shaped object in the sky. An alternate reality, her powers limited, strange little girls addicted to candy, these events seemed to have harkened back to tails of other-worldly dimensions filled with eldritch abominations, the sorts of legends one could find only in the deepest recesses of Isra's library or the Guardian Tower. What could that cube be? A tesseract? Some great deity unable to manifest in a form humans could comprehend? Some great cosmic nothing hell-bent on consuming anything that didn't subscribe to its ideation of perfectly formed geometric figures?!... It was a cottage.Huh.Jun quickly hid Blackbean on a shelf behind the bar and then turned to face the door, gathering what little energy she could muster in her chest. She positioned herself off to the side so she could still crane her neck to see out the window, but still remain largely out of line of sight. Although she would rather not be spotted, she wouldn't go down without a fight, even if she was only a fraction as powerful as she was used to. As she passed by the front of the bar to get into defensive position, she noticed once again that \"Alicia\" was consuming a confection, something which, now that she remembered, the guard did not seem pleased with. She cringed as the witch's booming voice rocked her eardrums. Oh she really dreaded having to fight this crazy spell caster. Hopefully, a more diplomatic solution would present itself...\"... Boots.\" She whispered to the guard. \"I'm guessing you wanted to say boots.\" She gave the guard a brief flash of sympathy before leering at the cottage and balling her fists. She didn't care what Alicia had done. NOBODY would threaten ANYONE'S precious woodland friends and get away with it!She looked back at Alicia, eyeing her boots for anything odd or magical. \"So... now's maybe not the best time, but what is so bad about Alicia consuming sugar like that?\" She asked the guard.", "1531031434000": "Jun would have been proud if she wasn't so horrified. She immediately sensed they were in big trouble if it came down to a direct confrontation with the witch. But now Keph's actions had all but made that a certainty.She frantically looked around the room as Keph was being bombarded by blue jays. Yes, Alicia had the boots. But Jun still would have preferred having some sort of tactical advantage during negotiations. All she had was the magic-eating Mr. Carrot...She decided it was time to pull a Keph.She ran towards the nearest broom closet and pulled out a large broom. Then she used what little power she had gathered to drag Mr. Carrot's psionic bubble outside with her towards Keph and the witch.\"You leave him alone you wretched roof-riding rabble-rouser!\" With an almighty swing, she whacked the bushy part of her broom into the psionic bubble, with the intent of batting him into the witch like a tennis ball. His bubble would defy the laws of physics just enough to hurl a sufficient distance and crash into the witch, where hopefully Mr. Carrot would start feeding off her magic in much the same way he ate the bunny ear spell.\u00a0", "1532891647000": "Some lightning quick impulse in Jun wrenched her over to Keph, as if a part of her was confident enough in Mr. Carrot's abilities that she felt she could now focus on getting the birds off of him without killing them. She knew Keph was acting in self-defense and had every right to strike the menaces down, but it was still a regrettable outcome. She hoped that by bashing the birds away with her broom, she'd abate their barrage with its relatively benign bristles, saving Keph while also sparing the birds the taste of Keph's vengeful steel.She whacked at the birds furiously, but then out of the corner of her eye, she saw Mr. Carrot weaken, its form falling apart like wet paper, and then its corpse slither off the roof and onto the ground with a splat. A pang of guilt stabbed her heart, but with all the adrenaline flowing through her, that guilt only served to enrage her more.\"What do you want you... whatever the hell I called you before because I'm too mad to remember!?\" She scolded the witch at the top of her lungs, while occasionally bashing more of Keph's avian assailants away.Jun wasn't able to register the fact that Mr. Carrot was still alive, still clinging on to existence with valiant gurgling. Apparently, the witch's spell was able to bypass the psionic bubble and incapacitate Mr. Carrot quite easily...... Or was it? After all, wasn't Mr. Carrot born of a plant that was capable of eating magic? Would Mr. Carrot remain a puddle of pea soup sludge? Or would its form slowly begin to absorb the magic of the spell, surreptitiously reforming itself into a sentient vine underneath all the chaos of the current events, and perhaps seek vengeance on she who dared liquify the mighty Mr. Carrot?(Find out on the next episode...)", "1535432657000": "Jun was utterly flabbergasted as the furry wave descended upon them. All she could think to do was help Keph up to his feet and pull him out of the way of the rampaging rodents. This situation seemed utterly hopeless. Her powers were muted, and the witch seemed determined to have her way with this entire situation. The only tool of hers which was even remotely effective was her anti-magic seeds, which could consume magic just the same as before, although not without turning into an abomination in the process. She could probably use them against the witch if she could get close enough. But that was a big if. She could also probably throw them at her if only she had a distra-She had an idea. She turned in front of Keph and dusted him off like a concerned mother. But while doing so she would quickly slip some seeds into his hands, and then begin focusing what little magic she had into them. Her magic was now painfully slow, and it would take time for the seeds to be ready to use. And even then Keph would have to figure out what to do with them. But it was the only plan she had.She would then stand up straight, turn back to the sorceress, and start gesturing frantically as she prepared to go on the following rant:\"I'm the devil woman!? Well what does that make you you you sadistic salacious insufferable shill of a sorceress! We're just defending ourselves. You're the one using animals as weapons! I'd never do something like that... except for that one time I did when my entire homeland was in danger but that doesn't count! Why you... If we were in my world I'd beat you over the head with a light construct pair of boots the size of your cottage and then come up with some witty retort about how one size doesn't fit all after all! It would be hilarious and everyone would laugh and I'd make sure the Isran newspaper quoted it in the article which I'd be sure to bring a copy of to your prison cell and scream, HAH!\" As Jun ranted and raved, she would periodically take a step closer to the witch and try to draw her attention away from Keph. A thin, invisible stream of magic and her will would continue to power the seeds. She could do this in part because of Lum'Valia's \"mind split\" training, and in part because she was a woman and it was about time she put those multitasking skills to good use.\"Now I demand an explanation! Who are you? What do you plan on doing? Who is this king and how do you know Alicia? Answer me or I'll-\"She held up her broom, and then turned to look at the broom. \"-well I'll probably lose catastrophically to your immense power but I'LL BET I CAN STILL GIVE YOU A REALLY NASTY BRUISE WITH THIS THING BY THROWING IT REALLY HARD AT YOU!\"She raised it up threateningly like a javelin and silently hoped beyond hope that Keph had figured out what to do with the seeds.", "1538586987000": "Jun's head turned to Keph with a sisterly look of gleeful approval. Keph you beautiful pale white-haired mute bastard.Then she heard the scream coming from the tavern.She dropped her broom, pulled out a pocket knife, and\u00a0ran towards the incapacitated witch. She got as close as she could to her without touching the overwhelming plants. She held more seeds in her hand.\"Ok, listen to me!\" She cried out to make sure she was heard through the renegade\u00a0biomatter. \"Call off your rats! I don't think I can stop these vines, but you might be able to get the rats to chew through them. Then we can negotiate a peace treaty between you, these people, and Alicia.\"She held her fist up menacingly. \"But if you make one false move, I'll shower you and all your little vermin friends with so many seeds they won't be able to eat them all in time.\" She then brandished the pocket knife. \"At least, not before I stab you.\"Jun had literally never stabbed someone before. Truth be told, she didn't want this to be the first time. The whole ordeal felt rather unsavory and unbecoming of anyone trying to be a heroine. Then again, a\u00a0hero was just a fancy term for an expert meddler, and when one meddled, one ran the risk of causing more harm than good. Hopefully, she was doing the right thing.", "1541358400000": "She had overestimated the vines' killing prowess.And, it\u00a0was in that moment, as the witch gurgled her dying breaths, that Jun realized that she was a spoiled brat.She raised her knife hesitantly, thinking she was going to cut the vines away. But she stopped. This witch had killed her predecessor. She had broken through whatever lines the village had set, and who knew how many bodies she had left in her wake doing so?You slaughtered hundreds of children-eating rock orcs, and you're gonna complain because this one has a pretty face? Grow the fuck up.Jun tore herself away from the witch's grizzly end.You can't make everything go according to plan.She ran towards Keph, towards the cabin.You defeated a powerful witch with limited magic in her home territory. Isra's graveyard is filled with heroes whose luck was poorer than yours.She peered into the window. She was about to drag Keph away so they could run.Being merciful is a privilege. Are you really going to throw a fit because you didn't have access to that privilege? Because you had to actually kill someone to save the day?But she couldn't help it.\"YOUR MASTER IS GETTING STRANGLED TO DEATH YOU STUPID FURRY FUCKS!\" She shrieked into the cabin as loud as she could.So this is how you act when you don't have magic.", "1443672375000": "While on her way to find a dragon to help teach her draconic magic, Jun came across a large, strange looking mansion. She wasn't used to seeing dwellings like this, which seemed more well suited for royalty than just normal people. She shrugged it off and decided to check out the place.\"Oh, hello madam. I'm Jun and I'm new to this area. Who are you?\"", "1443673142000": "She was caught off guard by the sudden hospitality. \"Umm, yah sure! Whatever you have a surplus of.\"She spotted Riven and smiled endearingly. She hadn't interacted with small children in a while. \"Your kids are lovely. I think I've heard the Fletcher name get dropped around. What's your family about?\"", "1443673955000": "\"Well, I'm a mage, and I also run errands for the Princess of Medan. I'm her bodyguard and lady in waiting. Aside from that I tutor and take odd jobs.\" She smiled, somewhat proud of her accomplishments. \"Right now however I'm on a personal mission. I'm looking to become more powerful. My last mission with the princess was a failure and I feel like I need to grow more.\"She was surprised at Granny's mention of Medanese Gold. \"That's a pretty high end item to have a surplus of isn't it?\"", "1443675408000": "\"I could always use the extra money. Sure, I'd be happy to teach your kids. And if you need any other help around the house maybe I could do that too.\"She wasn't in a hurry and displayed no discomfort in waiting for a drink. \"I do hope your employees are treated well.\" She winked. \"And don't feel bad. The mission failed largely because we were interrupted by a powerful dark entity, some kind of evil-hunting wraith. But luckily no one was killed, and, well it's complicated. Let's just say it may have worked out for the best.\"She thought of her friend Jill and how she ran off with her sister. Their civilization did need that artifact more than Medan she supposed.", "1443677389000": "Jun couldn't believe her luck. A new job and free food. \"I'll take anything you have. I'm not picky about food. As for your kids, well, we'd have to figure out a number of things, like how much of an affinity for magic they have and what sort of elements they're aligned towards. It's true that with some hard work anyone can do anything, but it's always best to play with your strengths.\"This was nice. She didn't get to discuss the technicalities of magic very often. \"Do you have any experience with magic?\"", "1443679202000": "\"Thank you so much! Yum!\" She dug into the food, remembering the table manners that Camilla had taught her so as to not look like an uncultured buffoon, even though that's more or less what she was.Unfortunately there was one social norm she still wasn't quite clear on. She hung her head low and whispered to Granny's ear. \"I really hate to ask this but, should I give our server a small token of gratuity?\"", "1443682135000": "\"Heh, of course she does. I guess spell casting burns a lot of calories!\" She dug in.After a few minutes of food and wine, she remembered something odd about what Granny said. \"So I take it you don't consider Medan or the Free City to be foreign. Just how far removed does one have to be to be considered foreign? What about Katashima and the uncharted lands farther East?\"She was born in the Land-Tiller's Expanse after all, which up until its alliance with the Phoenix State was mostly isolated and uncharted. She was starting to feel a tad insecure.", "1443723273000": "Jun saw an opportunity to manipulate Granny's view of foreigners. \"I suppose everyone has their list of favorite and least favorite foreigners. I'm not too fond of Katashimans myself, so isolated and a bit of a superiority complex. The Phoenix State's tricky because there's so much variety, but generally they're pretty high and mighty about their \"pharaoh\". I've actually heard very good things about the forest people in the East, but the Phoenix State will probably ruin them. Honestly I'm not too familiar with the Varans at all.\"I'm a genius, she thought to herself.\"As for what I could teach, well... hmm...\" She pulled out a scroll and a writing utensil and started scribbling. \"Well, I mostly deal with offensive and defensive magic, along with some herbalism. It would really depend on what your affinity is. Magic is an art that manipulates the life force energy that all living things possess. As living things we're all connected with the forces of nature in some way. If you've ever given yourself a static shock on a door handle, you've experienced a small touch of lightning. Your body radiates its own natural heat. When you show love for plants, they grow faster. When you show love for people, they heal faster and live longer. When you're angry and depressed and despise people, people stay away from you. These are essentially very weak forms of lightning, fire, earth, light, and dark magic, and we can all do them.\"When she had finished her diagram, she laid them out on the table to the side and placed her hand over them. A blue stream of energy began to flow into the scroll, and the letters turned a bright blue and then faded into black again.\"Sorry I felt compelled to do this now. When I get the urge to do something I just prefer to do it before I forget later. This scroll acts as an affinity identifier. Anyone can place their hands on it and it'll reveal what sort of magic they'd be best at. In my case...\" She placed her hand on the scroll. All the runes lit up, but the dark and fire runes lit up the brightest. \"I've been practicing to the point where I can use all the elements, but darkness and fire are my strengths.\"She put the scroll away and went back to eating. \"Maybe later we can figure out the affinities of all your family members and I could teach them some basic spells. Even if their affinity is weak, you can still acquire an external mana source and have them manipulate that energy, so that you can use magic once or twice in an emergency situation.\"", "1443743796000": "\"Hmm, well, I can't stay for too long and I've got my own journey to follow. Tell you what, I'll accept your terms, but I'll only stay long enough to teach each one of you, including yourself, one spell, proficiently. It may not seem like much but you'll find learning subsequent spells easier and easier. It's never too late to learn something new.\" She winked at the elderly woman. \"A week or two should do it.\"Her eyes flashed red for a second. \"I should warn you, my specialty is combat. I'm not the one to ask if you wanna learn to pull a rabbit out of a hat.\" She grinned devilishly.", "1443744531000": "\"I'll make sure they don't hurt each other. Hey, if it takes longer I could stay a little bit. And yes, thank you so much!\" She gladly accepted the chocolate. \"You know, I'd take a slight pay garnish if you could have your cook teach me a thing or too. I'm really not much of a chef, but I'd like to learn!\"She was starting to like this xenophobic old bat. <3", "1443745827000": "\"Best meal I've had in a while. I definitely don't need to be around food for a while. So let's say magic, and let's start with you if you have time. But first let's clear some space.\" She got up and focused her mind and whispered \"Psionic Art: Kinetic Will.\" A purple light shined from her forehead and she reached out to the dishes. Despite some rattling, the dishes slowly eased their way up into the air and settled themselves in stacks, which would make things easier for the servants.\"Just to show you I'm not all talk.\" She grinned.She pulled out the scroll she had made earlier. \"Please put your hand on the scroll...\"Two of the runes glowed. \"Mostly earth, some fire. There's a good chance these run in your family too...\"The next few weeks were gonna be interesting.", "1443748995000": "*epic training montage!!*The next few weeks were indeed, interesting. It turned out most of the Fletcher family had a knack for earth and fire, so Jun would focus on that. Every person had their own personality too, and each of them wanted to learn a different spell.Granny herself would learn how to perform a basic earth spell. \"You've got to feel the energy through your body, but mostly in your feet. You've got to feel it rising through your body...\" Jun talked her through various exercises, many of which were surprisingly physical. Variously stretches and slow moving poses to help her feel the earth energy within her. The kids would join in in addition to their own tutoring time. As time went on, Granny became more and more proficient at feeling earth energy. \"Now you just have to turn it into something useful.\" Visualization exercises, various hand movements, breathing exercises. Jun felt like she was in charge of a classroom.As it turned out, the Fletcher family didn't have much of a mana pool, which was unfortunate. However, Jun had ways of creating more mana through the use of certain minerals and plants. Jun even contemplating teaching them how to use their own blood as a power source, but decided against it, seeing as it was a tactic best used for dark magic anyways.At the end of the first week, with a little bit of help, from an external mana source (or Jun herself) they could move rocks and stones around and even fling them rather hard.Still, this was taking longer than she had thought...The next week...\"The more you practice, the more your mana pools will increase. Just try to use your time wisely. Like your physical stamina, your earth energy has limits too...\"She smiled. Granny was now able to produce a basic defensive wall with dirt and rock.The kids were learning even faster. Each casting took several tries, and occasionally Jun had to lend some of her mana to her students from her own body, but with each session the number of successful casts increased. It was like watching someone ride a bike, and with each session they fell down less and less...The walls themselves were getting stronger too. Jun would test them by firing a mild psionic blast at them. At first they could scarcely ward off the equivalent of a human punch, but eventually they became capable of stopping a wild bull charge or the strike of a great hammer. Some of the kids weren't that good at making walls, but they could hurl rocks pretty damn hard, all the way up to the boulder range (Jun found this out the hard way with a blow to the stomach; luckily she was ok).\"Now let's try fire.\"A few days later...It was essentially the same process. First they would have to learn how to feel fire energy. More attention was focused on the breath and one's inner warmth. She pointed out that it helped to visualize the air as tiny particles, and that creating heat energy was a matter of making those particles move fast enough. Fire was the ultimate manifestation of excitement and energy in matter. In a way it was a very happy force, a playful force, perhaps an angry, zealous force, different from the steadfast, quiet strength of the earth.It wasn't long before the kids were producing sparks. Sadly Granny had not made much progress, so instead focused on earth magic. All the Fletcher's mana pools were increasing dramatically.\"You know, it IS taking longer than I thought it would, but you guys are actually pretty good at this. I forgot how hard it is for a beginner to learn magic, especially when you're not born with it. I'm really proud of you guys!\"At the end of the third week, all the kid Fletchers could fire small bolts of plasma with the strength of a grenade, enough to make a large predatory animal think twice about attacking, assuming it could even survive the blast.\"Not bad... not bad at all.\" Jun smiled, even though she was covered in second degree burn marks. \"Although, I should probably teach one of you water magic so you don't burn this fancy mansion of yours down!\"", "1443753520000": "\"You're very welcome! Thank you for being such good students. Tell you what. Before I leave, I'll leave you guys some gifts too. Just give me some time to work on them. Rowena, do you mind if I have access to Grunhilda?\"A few days later Jun was done. \"There you go.\" She bequeathed on all the Fletchers staves made of hardwood, with little quartz crystals inset at the top, quartz being a relatively easy material to obtain that could focus magic. \"It's not much. You could probably purchase better staves, but these should suit your needs until you decide to find a better tutor than me.\"She turned to Rowena. \"I also made a slight modification to Grunhilda. If you can focus some earth energy into it, it'll become much lighter and easier for you to wield, so you can wield it once again.\"With this Jun decided it was time for her to leave, off in search of a dragon once again.\"One more thing, not all foreigners are bad. Don't forget to open up your heart once in a while.\" She looked back with a wink.", "1455999230000": "At this point, Jun wasn't sure what to do with herself. She was walking down a particularly dusty section of the open road, having just left Falkreath in search of something to do. More training? Something heroic? Some odd jobs? Visit family and friends? It was a late afternoon, so it was unlikely she'd get anything spectacular done today. She sighed and took a swig of water. Her black armor was uncomfortably warm, but she decided to keep it on in case someone attacked her. There were rumors of dangerous gnolls in the area. She wasn't entire sure what a gnoll was, but it sounded troubling.Damn.She sat down on a nearby tree stump and drew out Resonance, the living sword she had acquired that fateful day. She swung it around randomly. \"Oh, man, we helped bring a kid back to life from a quantum void, the source of your personality no less. That must have earned me quite a bit of favor with you, huh?\" The blue sword glimmered in the setting sun, but it didn't respond. Jun could feel it giving off a pleasant vibe though. \"You must be tired\", she said. Without thinking she began drawing random runes and letters in the dust with the tip of the weapon.A crow cawed nearby.", "1456001314000": "Jun does notice something odd approaching her on the horizon. At first she slowly rises and shakes some of the dust off her shin guards. She's even about to holster her weapon. But when she sees their numbers, she once again draws Resonance. The sword starts to glow as sparks of mana jolt from the chains on her gauntlets (concealed under her cloak) into the blade.\"Please be friendly please be friendly please be friendly.\" She takes the sword in both hands and grips it tightly, then pulls it to her side as though she were getting ready to stab something with all her might, not realizing it was a totally incorrect stance for such a small weapon and she kinda looked like an idiot... a somewhat intimidating idiot in a black cloak with a glowing blue weapon, but an idiot none-the-less.As the carriage made her position, Jun would suddenly become very aware of her petite size compared to the warriors. The young, oriental looking brunette was a full foot shorter than their apparent commander. Still, they didn't seem particularly hostile.Still in her silly stance, Jun cried out, \"Hey! So..., dumb question but... you guys aren't gnolls are you?!\"", "1456003472000": "Jun lowers the weapon and bites her lower lip. \"Uh...\" She struggled to take in the size of the man and was somewhat entranced by his voice. She shakes her head and addresses the question. \"Umm, it's a special weapon. I got it from a powerful mage. It's quite friendly... I mean, uh-\" Jun grimaced when she realized she had given away the fact the sword was alive (or that she was less than sane). \"I MEAN THE MAGE, the mage was quite friendly.\" She holstered it. \"I'm not an expert swordsman so it still feels kinda awkward to me. Makes a great steak knife though!\"A dozen different thoughts went through her mind. Should she reveal that she was a mage? Should she trust the man with her knowledge? Did the man think she was crazy? What kind of shampoo did the man use? For that matter what kind of lotion? For that matter why was she thinking about Vaelar's personal hygiene?!The nearby crow cawed mockingly. Jun swung her head over and gave it a sarcastic look.", "1456006892000": "Jun smirked. \"Deal!\" She extended her hand out in friendship. \"I'm Jun of the Celadine Clan in the Land-Tiller's Expanse. You can just call me Jun.\" My god this man had nice eyes. \"You know, I was just looking for a sword master to teach me. This works out perfectly.\" She couldn't believe her luck. A handsome mercenary practically fell out of the sky to teach her. That's when she heard the familiar cry. \"Doobie? HEY, DOOBIE!\" She waves in the direction of the cry.\"So, Vaelar, have you ever met a magic-using kobold?\"", "1456009254000": "\"... I take it those are the gnolls.\" Jun drew out Resonance. \"Resonance, my friend is in danger. I'm gonna need your help. I can't promise we won't have to kill them.\" The sword shined brightly in approval.Jun spotted the archers in the group and moved towards the center of the band of mercenaries, peaking through their defensive line to gauge Doobie's position and that of the gnolls. She wasn't sure she could take them all out, yet another reason to thank her luck for finding a band of mercenaries. \"Vaelar, there's something else you should know about me.\" She raised her sword in the air. A point of light appeared a few inches above the very tip. She was invoking the swords first ability, to take her own mana and cast a spell twice as powerful as she was normally capable of in half the time. The white glowing point rapidly grew into a fiery sphere. The air swirled around her and blew her cloak up in the air, revealing her black armor.\"Fire Art: Resonance Holy Plasma Blast!\" She swung the sword forward and the sphere arched over Vaelar's men and to the side like a curve ball. It sped through the front section of the flanking arch of gnoll warriors, hopefully knocking them down, and would detonate in the bulk of their forces. The blast would be significant. Boosted by Resonance, the already powerful bomb would easily leave a large crater in the ground. Any gnolls caught even close to it would get an air blast to the face which could shatter bones. Anything caught in the epicenter would also suffer severe burns and enormous concussive force.That said, the holy energy would stop short of killing anyone. Hopefully the gnolls would take it as a warning to flee, or her next strike would not be so forgiving.", "1456017738000": "Jun would never have admitted it, but the times that Vaelar patted her on the shoulder cause a very funny sort of chill to run through her skin, a warm chill, if that made any sense. Then again, she couldn't help her annoyance at being called \"initiate\". She was far from deciding if she wanted to join them, though if she thought about it afterwards she would suppose it might have been in jest.As soon as Jun saw that the gnolls were in retreat, she would relax her pose. She was impressed by how quickly the mercenaries were able to mobilize, but was also shocked by the brutality with which they dispatched the gnolls. Still, there was no rational way to stop them, and the gnolls would have to accept the consequences of their charge. Thankfully the creatures were wise enough to treat. But why were they attacking in the first place?She sheathed Resonance and ran up to Doobie. \"Doobie, it's me. Are you alright?!\" She kneeled down and would treat any wounds he had suffered. \"Doobie! I lost you after we were teleported away. How are you?\"", "1456019836000": "Jun was glad Doobie was ok. \"Hey, your hair looks great.\"Jun would face Vaelar after the battle. \"Doobie's one of my closest friends. He can help fight the gnolls too. Doobie, meet Vaelar, the leader of these guys. Vaelar's agreed to teach us sword fight if we help him deal with those guys.\"Jun knew Vaelar didn't agree to teach the kobold too, hence the mischievous grin she now wore.", "1456022245000": "\"... Greaaat...\" Jun feigned some enthusiasm. Vaelar was charismatic, but something about his attitude she found off-putting. She couldn't quite put her finger on it. But maybe it was just how mercenaries were. She also wasn't sure about his attitude towards kobolds.\"Doobie, you wouldn't believe it. I helped bring back a kid from... I guess he wasn't dead exactly, but non-existent. The time mage did something and accidentally erased him, and we brought him back. It was incredible. It took four of us. I've never seen anything like it before. Also, we should visit the shrine we went to someday. It's a really nice place, and if you use your stand there I'll be it would become super powerful!\" Jun smiled. She wished Doobie had been there to see it himself. She was also happy Doobie had met another Stand User. Jun herself couldn't get the hang of it, though she didn't know why.As they walked towards the armory, Jun made an odd clicking sound. The nearby crow (who had the sense to stay out of the battle) flew away from its tree and landed on her shoulder. She whispered very quietly, \"Naram ahst fen. Make sure Doobie is safe while we're here.\" A small sigil appeared on its back, glowing slightly before fading away. The crow nodded and flew off again, but remained relatively close.The armory was about what she expected. The truth is none of the items, in her opinion at least, compared to the armor that Imud Habrua had made for her in Medan. And Jun found it too cumbersome to use anything but the smallest buckler shield. Then again, she did start to wonder if perhaps such a thing would be useful. When she found one she liked, she took it and fitted it over her wrist. It wasn't so bad. Her mana still flowed freely.Not a single weapon came anywhere near the high quality of Resonance.Satisfied that none of the other equipment would suit her, she stepped out to the training yard to meet Vaelar.", "1456025874000": "Jun smiled politely. \"Thanks! It just kinda makes the most sense y'know- oh crap.\" Jun smacked herself in the face when she realized she brought Resonance, a live weapon, to the training ground. Jun quickly scampered after the knight and with beady eyes asked for his training sword, which was about the same size as her sword. Presumably the knight would agree and Jun would nod her head forward politely in gratitude. Last thing she wanted was to accidentally decapitate Valiant-er Vaelar.\"Ok, welp, I'm ready to begin.\" Once again Jun was painfully aware of the height difference between the two. The last person she sparred with was Jill, and she was only a little taller. This guy was a monster... a very attractive monster with wonderful hair and skin but still a monster.Jun has a crush, Jun has a crush, she could hear an unpleasant voice in the back of her mind say.", "1456027693000": "Jun blinked. This was utterly hopeless. Then she thought back to what Jill had taught her...Holding the shield up with her left, she inched in, one twist of her foot at a time, keeping her legs firm, left in front and right in back. Using her right as a pivot she made as forceful and rapid a lunge as she could at Vaelar's hilt. Whether it was successful or not she'd retract the sword back and keep her buckler front and firm.", "1456209254000": "Unfortunately Jun wasn't gonna let his retreat go unpunished. Feeling the powerful inertia of the sword against her shield, she leans into the strike, using her back foot to launch forward. It wouldn't do much, but it might make him take a split second longer to go into a low stance.A nasty little grin creased on her face and she would try to smack Vaelar's sword out of the way with her buckler, then make an upward slash with her sword, hoping to catch the space behind his grip and disarm him.The brief time she had trained with Jill, she had learned that she had a very aggressive style. This kitten had claws. \u00a0RAWR!(She didn't actually make a kitten rawr sound, but her relatively small feminine grunts might come off that way.)", "1456210682000": "Jun was starting to pant. She knew Vaelar was significantly stronger than her. It was an alien feeling to be going toe to toe with someone so overwhelmingly powerful (she and her father never did melee training, and her mom was an archer). But for some reason it made her want to try even harder.Jun gasped and her faced turned red. Vaelar's pommel strike was the wrong angle to hit her sternum, but the right angle to strike... somewhere else... The concussive shock wave traveled through the dragon plate on her right breast and into, well, her right breast.She grimaced and bared her teeth as the white heat bubbled outward into her arms and torso. Her emotions were a mix of petty anger, amusement, shock, and an urge to laugh. Then she remembered they were still fighting.She was in a very bad position. Her temporary short circuit meant that Vaelar had plenty of time to wind up his upper slash. She decided to try to dart backwards and at least try to ensure only a glancing blow on her (or a miss if she was lucky). Then she'd try to counterattack.", "1456212858000": "Vaelar's obviously going easy on her if he has time to taunt her. Even though it was just a training exercise, she wanted desperately to land a blow.Once again, she thought back to Jill.There was an evil flash in her eyes as Jun charged forward with her shield. She aimed to strike Vaelar's grip in the exact interval between the rise and fall of his swing. It was the one instance where her height (or lack thereof) would give her an advantage, since it was easier to push up with all your might than down with just your upper body. Still, it was more than likely Vaelar's overwhelming strength and bulk would overcome her defense in a second.But then again, it only takes a second to snap kick an overconfident guy in the groin.", "1456214138000": "Jun hoped her little failed stunt wouldn't cost her a holy virtue!She had created an opening. She decided to go all in and make an almighty swing with her sword at Vaelar's  left knee.This, but technically the opposite direction, and a woman.", "1456216059000": "Jun is now panting. \"Haaaa...haaa... thanks... I think I learned a lot from that... But I know you're going easy on... me.\"She grinned and helped him up. \"You know, it was nice... seeing... you on one knee though, even for a second... Wanna go again?\"", "1456219185000": "Jun's eyes grow wide as also puts her sword and buckler away. \"OH! W-w-we well sure if you don't mind.\" Her face turns slightly red again. She beckons for Doobie to accompany them, since he needs a place to sleep too. The crow from before follows along and lands on Jun's head. \"Ouch, Blackbean, you could be more subtle!\"She grins and looks up at Vaelar's friendly face, and points a finger at the top of her head. \"This is Blackbean. He's something of a familiar. I think he can sleep outside though. OUCH!\" The crow obviously agrees, but gives her one last peck before flying off towards a nearby tree.The sigil on his back is still active, though invisible.When they entered the tent, Jun realized she needed to dress into something more comfortable. \"You know, I should probably change out of my armor.\" She winked and made a gesture as though she was going to change right in front of Vaelar. It started with a come hither look and a slow tugging of her straps. She would then take a step forward towards the general as if to give him a better view, and flick her hair a bit. Her lips parted slightly and she bore her teeth juuuust a tad...Then there would be a bright flash of light.Jun would automatically be wearing a comfortable looking set of cotton pajamas.She always wanted to pull that prank on someone.She was smiling mischievously. \"What, did I scare you?\"", "1456221465000": "Jun dutifully turns around, still proud of herself over the prank she pulled.When she was sitting down in the middle of the road, trying to figure out what to do with herself, she didn't expect to run into a bunch of gnolls and mercenaries.Her mind began to drift. It was all well and good that the gnolls posed a threat to the travelers of the road, and that Vaelar and his men were being paid to fight them off. But she had to wonder, why were the gnolls attacking in the first place. They were obviously intelligent. Were they just thieves? Did they really deserve to die? Had anyone tried negotiating with them?When it sounded like Vaelar was done Jun turned around. She was still in the middle of this thought process when her eyes settled on the rather impressive bulge that Vaelar was sporting.She blinked.Something told her that chastity was going to be one of the last virtues she earned. Sorry Lum'Valia.\"Uh, Doobie!\" Jun turned to her friend. \"Uhh... could you do me a favor? I haven't played with Resonance in a while and you know how it gets when you don't play with it. Would you mind playing hide-and-seek with it for a bit? Plus I think it wants to see your stand!\"The sword, as if it knew what Jun was thinking, would magically appear in front of Doobie and begin to float around.", "1456224289000": "Jun looked a Doobie pitiably as he was lead away. \"Don't worry! Resonance will keep you company!\" The magical sword floated along with Doobie to try to keep him safe. Likewise Blackbean was keeping an eye on him too. Jun rubbed her temples. \"You know, he really is one of my best friends. I'd risk my life to protect him. I just... It's been a while.\" Jun grinned before excitedly plopping on the rather large bedding. \"It's kinda weird. Nothing in my culture forbids little romantic trysts like this, and believe it or not neither does being a holy mage. I don't know why other cultures are so uptight about this sort of thing.\"", "1456224820000": "Jun calls out to Doobie. \"Resonance can look after the both of us. Besides, Blackbean's watching us too. Anything goes wrong we'll tear this whole camp apart!\"She sounded bright and happy when she said this... but she wasn't bluffing.", "1456226020000": "Jun raises an eyebrow as she pulls the gentleman closer to her. \"I see. I'm not gonna lie, you have a certain... magnetism about you... I just... wanted to get to know you better first. The fact that you're such a good teacher helps.\" Jun runs her hand through Vaelar's hair.She couldn't believe she was this close to someone she legitimately had a crush on after only a day. Her hand was literally trembling.Not only that, but the bed was extremely comfortable! \"Nice bedding by the way. Was this made in Medan too?\"", "1456228352000": "\"Let's... not talk about violence or war while we do this, ok?\" The last thing Jun wanted to think about was the Phoenix State. She accepts the kiss and reciprocates, her lips feeling out his own, getting the hang of his rhythm. Her left hand went up his biceps and shoulders while her right continued to caress his face and hair. The more they explored each other, felt each other's energy and pacing, the more comfortable she became. Her own deep brown eyes began to sparkle and reflect his violet eyes. To her, this was one of the more beautiful things about sex.This was gonna go rather nicely. She could tell.She gave a little gasp as Vaelar's hand met a particularly sensitive spot on her spine. She smiled and pulled back her head, bowing to his slightly. She took on a more demure countenance. \"You might actually appreciate this.\" Jun separated herself from him and removed her shirt, revealing that she had several small scars dotted around her body, including her back. \"It's what I get for wanting to be a hero all the time, always trying to help others and do the right thing. I'm rather proud of them.\"She once again raised her head up and reignited their ritual.", "1456229457000": "It was at this point that Vaelar would notice a strange phenomenon. As Jun became increasingly excited, sparkly bits of mana, like fairy sparkles, would begin to float off from her skin.It was just something mages did apparently. She really couldn't help it.(Fade to black)", "1456447496000": "Jun woke up at around the same time. She sat up and smacked her lips. Her hair was a mess.Then she took a sniff. It was an odd mix of the deep, pleasant, robust scent of venison, and ass.Jun waved her hand around. There was a slight pink glow at her finger tips, and the room would be filled with a sweet rose scent. The venison scent would be temporarily negated but it would return with time. The... other scent, would be more permanently removed.She yawned. \"Morning.\" As she tried to get up, she realized how sore she was. It was definitely a new sensation. Her last two partners were... not as much of a challenge. Her face turned red when she realized what she needed to do. Very shy, she grabbed her nether regions and whispered, \"Vokrii.\" This was easily the most embarrassing application of holy magic ever. As soon as she felt better, she got up.With a flick of her wrist, she summoned her new favorite outfit, a somewhat loose and flowery red blouse she bought from St. James Boutique. Grabbing the clothes in a bunch, she stepped towards the entrance. \"Is there a private tent I can go bathe? I don't need a water source. I can summon my own.\"", "1456455921000": "There was a bright flash of light, and with that Jun was wearing her cotton pajamas from before. \"AH!It's fine! No harm done.\" She waved her hands in the air apologetically!She was suddenly very glad she had used her rose scent spell earlier!\"So, how are you. Did you sleep ok?\"", "1456457722000": "Jun tried not to think about the implications of what Doobie said. Was Doobie familiar with human... mating... sounds? Nah, he was a deep sleeper. And they weren't that loud... were they?\"Oh, Vaelar's making food for us.\" She walked over to him and nudged him with her elbow teasingly. \"Right Vaelar?\"", "1456472753000": "Jun looked at Doobie slyly. \"Oh, trust me, I'm fine. In fact I've never been better. I was just naked because... well... the tent was warm.\"She took a spoonful of the stew. Her expression grew bright. \"WOW, this is amazing!\" She gobbled the strew furiously. \"You know I'm not a bad cook myself. I'd love it if you taught me how to make this!\"The only drawback to the warm stew was that she suddenly became more aware of how badly she needed to bathe. As soon as she was done, she'd go into the bedroom again. \"I'll be right back.\" She muttered \"Kun kuz buld\" and made a little light construct pale, and then waved her hands to summon some water into the pale for her to bathe.So Vaelar was a good cook. She was starting to like this guy...", "1456560979000": "Jun was finished bathing and was now legitimately dressed in her fashionably not-to-revealing red blouse. She walked in just as Doobie had issues his challenge to Vaelar.\"... Ok, wasn't expecting this.\" She grinned. \"Well, I'm gonna grab some training stuff and go train with one of the other cadets. You two macho men can duke it out next to us, because I also wanna watch.\"She headed outside, but not before she takes Resonance. \"Wouldn't want you to accidentally explode our new friend.\" She winked.", "1456616071000": "Jun is already sparring with a cadet by the time Doobie summoned his stand. She grinned. She understood that some people needed to get into conflicts with each other in order to establish mutual respect, and she wanted Vaelar and Doobie to respect each other.It was typically, though not always, a guy thing.Then again, her attitude of power play while they were having sex had no doubted contributed to Vaelar respecting her...Jun and the cadet would continue to parry and strike blows. She was really starting to get comfortable with a buckler. She wondered if Imud Habrua would be willing to make a buckler for her.", "1456626999000": "Jun bears witness to the unbridled fury that is Starman!She gets distracted and accidentally gets kicked in the groin by the cadet she is training with.As she kneels towards the ground, she turns to Doobie and gives a thumbs up. \"Yah... good job... Doobie!\" She says this with a pained, but grinning face.As she slowly rises, she punches her sparring partner in the balls. As he recoils they both start laughing.", "1456643945000": "Jun and the cadet had just gotten through a rather epic exchange. Jun was on the ground, nodding impressed. The cadet helped her up, and they bowed to each other amicably.She walked over to the combats. \"Have you boys worked out your aggression?\" She knelt down and whispered \"Vokrii\" to Doobie's shoulder. The cut sealed up instantly. She raised an eyebrow at Vaelar. She couldn't believe anyone could beat Doobie's stand in a melee fight!Vaelar was good...", "1456732561000": "\"Mm-MOM!\" Jun disappeared in a bright flash and reappeared right in front of the archer. She hugged her profusely. \"MOM! I'M SO GLAD TO SEE YOU! I'M... I'VE... I MISSED YOU!\" She would continue to hug her until her arms went limp.\"Here, let me introduce you to some of my friends. This here is Doobie. He's a kobold and he can use magic, as you probably saw. And this is Vaelar. He's teaching me sword play. We're also... we wuh wah we're friends too. And everyone, this is my mom! Ying-Na, of the Acacia Clan. She's the best archer in my tribe. OH DON'T SHOOT THE CROW!\"She gestured towards Blackbean. \"That's Blackbean. He's... well it's a long story.\"She glared at Ying-Na's overly sized longbow. She had never seen her with it before. \"Nice bow.\" ", "1456739095000": "Jun turned red and whispered back. \"Mommm... Look Vaelar's my business ok... and yes, he's... a challenge. But... I like challenges?\" There was no way to address this issue without being awkward.Upon hearing word about Medan, Jun would appear worried. \"Umm, yah, sure. Vaelar, mind if me and my mom go talk in the tent?\" Presumably he'd say yes. If so, they'd go and talk in private.***After several minutes, they might here some yelling. \"What? Our people did what?! How!?\"\"What do you mean no one knows what's going?\"\"Intaja?! She said what?!\"***Several minutes later Jun returned from the tend with her mother. They both appeared grim. \"I know you don't want me to do anything hasty... but something is definitely wrong there. Camilla wouldn't do something like that...\"Jun had learned that Medan had suddenly sealed off its borders and had apparently changed regimes. Most shockingly she learned that her own people had deployed forces to fight Medan. There were rumors that they possessed a mysterious anti-siege weapon. Intaja's visions described it as a fire from the sky... A dragon perhaps?Camilla, Evrand, Hylon, no one knew what happened to them.\"I don't know. There's nothing we can do about it, yet. Thanks for telling me, mom.\"After a few moments of silence, Jun said, \"So, what are we gonna do about the gnolls?\"", "1456781559000": "Jun blinks and shakes her head. \"Umm...\" She looks at everyone. \"Well... I don't know what's going to happen, but I sense we'll need more allies. I'm gonna go back to Falkreath and talk to the orcs. Anyone wanna come?\"", "1456782974000": "Jun scratched the back of her head. \"Umm...\" She looks longingly at Vaelar, and at her mother, and at Vaelar again, and at her mother again.Crap.\"Umm... Uhh...\""}
